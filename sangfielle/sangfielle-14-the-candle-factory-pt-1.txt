Austin (as narrator): With the moon low and the city asleep, the peculiar egg sac once resting in its nest had vanished, and its guards had been dispatched. This was a veritable crisis, or could be anyway. And if the Panic has taught us anything, it is that however bad the impetus of worry is, the worry itself can sometimes be twice the problem. Yes, fire and smoke are bad, but it is the trampling masses who ensure that simple damage turns to harm. And so, with that in mind, Blackwick’s council—led by Ekashi Wolff, its spiritual leader the Slumbousian nun Marisha, and its emerging business leader Dayward YVE—agreed immediately that no retainer would be too extreme to pay the Blackwick Group to solve this problem immediately. That way, by the time normal folk—folk like you and me—woke up, they could calm them with that common phrase: don’t worry, our best people are on it! Now, whether that meant shit from shat, that didn't matter. What mattered is people calmed down, and after all, what came next simply could not have been predicted. I mean, first of all, no one knew where the damn egg sac even was. That fancy train engine, the Grand Cormorant Limited., that had left town in a huff right in the middle of the night, so that was an option. But the guards, once they returned to sensibility, they said their assailants had come from further up the mountains. Second, who could have guessed that this would begin an extended departure for every member of the Blackwick Group? I mean, Yellowfield and then station ruins and what happened in Sapodilla...again, just unpredictable. All of which is to say, I don't think you can blame the Blackwick Group for being away when that sound rung out in Blackwick. The price was right, and the task took them far away, and they would never...well, I'm sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself, aren’t I? You know what, let’s slow down and start from the beginning.

Austin: Welcome to Friends at the Table, an actual play podcast focused on critical worldbuilding, smart characterization, and fun interaction between good friends. I am your host, Austin Walker. Joining me today, Ali Acampora?


Ali: Hi, I'm Ali, you can find me over at @ali_west on Twitter, and you can find the show over at @friends_table.


Austin: Sylvia Clare.


Sylvia: Hey, I'm Sylvi. You can find me on Twitter at @sylvibullet, and you can listen to my other show Emojidrome wherever you get your podcasts.


Austin: Janine Hawkins.


Janine: Hey, you can find me at @bleatingheart on Twitter.


Austin: And Andrew Lee Swan.


Dre: Hey, you can find me on Twitter at @swandre3000.


Austin: You can follow me on Twitter at @austin_walker. You can support the show by going to friendsatthetable.cash. By the time this goes up, we will have finished releasing all of the character interview Drawing Maps episodes. Those were all very fun and good, and you should go listen to them. If you want to hear me talk for an hour to two about everyone’s inspirations about their characters— and not just inspirations, but literally sometimes talking through, like, what are we doing this season? What are you up to? What is the vibe? How do we...what sort of story should we tell? What themes are you interested in? What are touchstones for you? Et cetera. You should go listen to those. Those have been a blast to listen back to now, now that we’re in the middle of the season, and see how many things came from those conversations, just some very productive conversations, IMO. Speaking of characters, we should go over the characters today. If I can just get your characters’ names, pronouns, and beats, current beats, that would be great. Let’s start with Dre. Let’s go reverse order. Dre, go ahead.


Dre: So, I'm playing Chine, who uses he/they pronouns. They’re a Cleaver, and my active beats are “Perform an act of service to an NPC witch,” which is minor.


Austin: Mmhmm.


Dre: And I have a major beat of “Establish a bond with a heartsblood beast.”


Austin: Mmm, mm-hmm. Great.


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: Let’s go, again reverse order, that’s Janine.


Janine: I'm playing Es, she/they pronouns. She’s a Witch. My current minor beat is “Help an important or influential figure in a haven.” My current major beat is “Catalogue your exploits for an extended period. Either do it yourself or hire a bard.”


Austin: Mmm. Okay. And you started working on that last one when you made contact with a writer for the Heartland Rider.


Janine: Yes. Technically I teed it up when I got the notebook from the sexy rat god temple.


Austin: True. True, that is true, yes. And started taking your story down, which now you’ll kind of talk through with that writer.


Janine: My trapper keeper.


Austin: [chuckles] Exactly. Sylvi.


Sylvia: Yeah, I am playing Virtue Mondegreen, pronouns are she/her. She is the Deadwalker. My current beats are “Gain favor with a faction that can help you learn more about your goal,” that’s my minor beat. 


Austin: Mm-hmm.


Sylvia: And my major one is “Kill someone who is trying to stop you from claiming knowledge.” Pretty normal stuff.


Austin: Just normal stuff. That’s a major one, right? Yeah.


Sylvia: Yeah, that is major.


Austin: And then Ali.


Ali: Yeah, I'm playing Marn Ancura. My class is Keen, or Hound as written in the book.


Austin: Mm-hmm.


Ali: And my active beats are “Succeed at a task that someone else has recently failed to achieve,” and “Acquire an NPC bond that has access to useful info.” And Marn is she/her.


Austin: Yes. Okay. So, when we last left off, Chine, you were receiving a vision—


Dre: Uh huh.


Austin: Through some stop motion teeth animation in your head as you slept. And you named the Course, right?


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: The truth of the Heartland, the thing that will not stay still, reality itself. And then woke up to the loud noise of cries to the north of town, up on the kind of higher tier level where the main entrance to the mines is and also where the sort of nest with the strange egg sac from below, the chapel, or the ruined abbey rather, is. As that egg sac was taken away, that egg sac stolen away in the night. And I think we can zoom a couple of hours after that, but not very much further than that, as everyone has been risen from their sleep, or I don't know, if you’re a vampire, is this— [Sylvia laughs] Virtue, is this...are you just awake anyway at night?


Sylvia: Yeah, I think straight up, if someone comes to the office or whatever—


Austin: Mm-hmm.


Sylvia: Our headquarters, that’s a better word for it.


Austin: Sure.


Sylvia: Office makes it sound like we have cubicles. 


Austin: Uh huh. [laughs]


Sylvia: If someone came there, they’d just find Virtue the only one awake with a candle taking notes or reading over her notes or something.


Austin: Yeah. Chine, do you go downstairs when you see or hear this happen? Do you actually inform Virtue of this cry before even town authorities or whatever come to get you?


Dre: Um…yeah, I guess— 


Austin: Or do you just roll over and go back to bed? [Dre sighs] What’s your response when this yelling happens?


Dre: I assume that I've heard about the other group’s exploits with said egg, so no, I probably do kind of like...maybe I get downstairs right as the authorities are showing up, as I kind of take my time doing it, but I think I do head down to tell people that someone is screaming about an egg sac.


Austin: Yeah. Yes. Just to clarify, the other group, I don’t think did anything with the egg.


Dre: Oh, okay.


Austin: They just went down there where the egg was originally found.


Dre: Gotcha.


Austin: But the egg was brought back by that group of young people during our Ground Itself game and has been protected basically ever since, put inside of that weird wooden constructed nest looking thing that Ali described in the Ground Itself game, that was pulled out of the mines, basically. So, while the other group did dig into— wait, actually, I'm thinking about it.


Ali: It was us that did that.


Austin: No, you were with the group. That was you!


Sylvia: Yeah.


Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was you that did the go down into the mine, or go down into the church.


Dre: Mmm.


Austin: Yeah, the other group did some house shit. They didn’t do shit with that egg.


Dre: Oh, okay.


Janine: Yeah, I was sitting here feeling real bad like, “Was Dre in that game and I just totally forgot he was there?” [Ali laughs]


Austin: Yeah, I was like, wait a second, wait a second. Well, 'cause I was like, who did anything near the egg? I guess it’s the group who went down into the ruins, but no, yeah, neither group.


Janine: Yeah, we did nothing to do with anything.


Austin: Yes.


Janine: Which is also why I'm like, uh, can we get a gentle recap here of what I should maybe know. [Sylvia laughs] 


Austin: Yes, yeah.


Dre: Yeah, fair.


[0:09:42]


Austin: So, the whole thing with that egg was putting that egg in that nest seemed to— and this is stuff that probably gets told to you diegetically by whoever comes from the city council in the middle of the night to be like, hey, that egg getting stolen is bad, because we think that putting that egg sac in that nest is what broke the curse, so removing it from that nest seems like it could be bad. And at this point, I think there are two leads, in terms of where it could go. People who are...yeah, I guess some miners… One, there were guards around that egg. Those guards got knocked unconscious, knocked the fuck out. They said— one of them doesn’t remember anything. Let’s say two of them don't remember anything. The third one got into a fight with a big dude. The big dude beat the crap out of him. He’s recovering now. There are tracks going to the west up into the mountains, and then they lose the tracks because they’re not professional trackers in that way. But there is also a lot of debate about whether that is a kind of a fakeout, because people also know that in the middle of the night, the big train that was in town up until yesterday seemed to bounce unannounced very quickly, and that train was heading south towards Sapodilla. And so half of the Blackwick Group is heading down to Sapodilla, and that is the group that you are not playing in today, obviously. [Austin and Sylvia chuckle] That is the other group. Y'all are gonna be part of the group who is trying to potentially chase down the egg by going up into the mountains and seeing if you can follow the tracks from that and see where that might lead. Time will tell which group ends up finding the egg sac, but it’s a good motivation for both of you, at this point. I should reiterate our goals, as always, at the top of the game. I forgot to do that until just now. I should say, we are playing Heart: The City Beneath by Grant Howitt and Christopher Taylor. Our goals: instead of planning, ask questions; reuse details, but always evoke an atmosphere of wonder, horror, and humanity; build and break tension; pay attention to what players at the table want, both long-term and short-term; and play to find out what happens. So, here’s my question: what happens? It’s still before sunrise. You've all been briefed on this. Do you jump to it immediately? Is there anything you want to take care of before trying to head up into the mountains and follow these tracks? Et cetera. 


Sylvia: I'm ready to go, but that’s mostly just because it’s a good time for me. [Ali and Dre laugh] 


Austin: Mm-hmm.


Ali: Yeah, it’s…I understand the impulse to be like, “let’s wait until morning,” but if it’s like a, we can actively, you know, follow these people, that seems…


Austin: Yeah.


Dre: Yeah.


Ali: Time-sensitive.


Dre: Sure.


Austin: Alright, that seems—


Dre: I can see in the dark, so let’s go. [Ali laughs] 


Austin: Let’s go, then. Yeah, totally. So, you know, your group preps their stuff. You all have all your stuff with you. You have no idea how long this journey is, so I imagine there’s gonna be a degree of “do I bring my backpack with all my shit?” and I think you’re all smart enough to know that when you’re chasing down quarry who has a strange egg sac, you really...you could get lost out there, so you better bring all your shit. And you go up to where the nest was, and very quickly are able to find the very basic kind of footprints in the dirt that lead up into the rocky crags above the main entrance of the mine. They don't go into the mine, they go up and around it. So yeah, we’re gonna begin a...I'm gonna say this is not a delve yet. This is just this kind of initial march up these hills, trying to keep track of and see if there’s any other leads on where that person or group of people may have gone. I think just by looking at the footprints, I would say anyone here who has any sort of tracking experience, which I feel is probably Chine and definitely Marn, would be able to be like, alright, there’s like three people here who came down from the mountains. You see footprints down and then also going back up. But as the dirt gives way to some firmer stone in some places, it’s easy to lose those tracks. Who is taking the lead on trying to track these people down? Who wants to roll some dice, is really what I'm asking. In the middle of the night.


Dre: I mean, it is probably Chine or Marn, I would imagine.


Austin: Yeah, who— I would say this is Hunt.


Dre: Got that.


Austin: Hunt, probably Wild, because you’re just up in the mountains. I don't think any of you have Wild, unfortunately.


Sylvia: No. I didn't take that move. Thought about it.


Austin: Yeah. Yeah. [Ali chuckles] So then, Chine, that sounds like a roll for you.


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: You start at two dice. Let me go down the— you know what? [chuckles] Shoutouts to Tewhit, who is one of the mods on the Friends at the Table Discord, or at least when I was last in that Discord, Tom was one of the mods. [Sylvia laughs] @souloftwhit on Twitter, T-W-H-I-T, put together a really good single page, here is what the rules of Heart are.


Janine: Like an infographic.


Austin: Like an infographic.


Dre: Mmm, yeah.


Austin: That’s kind of a modified version of the one in the book, that I'm gonna just walk through so that everyone listening has maybe a better idea of, again, how this system works, because it’s now been weeks since we started playing, and it’s easy for us maybe to move more quickly than—


Janine: We’ve just gotta hit buttons.


Austin: We’ve just gotta hit buttons, exactly.


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: So, the first thing you do in this game is you build a dice pool of D10s. All of the roll to succeed dice here are D10s. So you start with one for free, then you add any relevant skill and any relevant domain, and if you have a mastery, which can come from a couple of different things, you also add one for that. So, to start with here, Dre, you have one D10, then a plus one from the…


Dre: Hunt.


Austin: From Hunt. You don't have any domains, and I don’t think you have any masteries here, that I know of.


Dre: Nope.


Austin: Or any skills that give you mastery, for instance. And you don’t have any knacks, which is another thing that can give you mastery, which we’ll come to if we come to. Is anyone helping?


Ali: I can, ‘cause I also have this skill, and it seems practical that I would also be snooping, yeah.


Austin: Yeah, absolutely. Definitely snooping along here. [Ali laughs] So that means take another plus one, Dre.


Dre: Okay.


Austin: Then you roll dice and you remove any dice for difficulty. In this case, it’s a Standard roll. If it was a Risky roll, you would remove your highest die. If it was a Dangerous roll, you would remove your two highest dice. I would say it would be…tracking at night would be dangerous, but you have this night vision, right?


Dre: Yes.


Austin: What’s that come from? What’s the…is that…?


Dre: I have a skill called Darkling Eyes.


Austin: Mm-hmm. Which is a Delve skill?


Dre: “Your jet black eyes allow you to see in pitch black darkness.” Yeah.


Austin: There you go.


Dre: And it also gives me Delve skill, yeah.


Austin: And also it gives you jet black eyes.


Dre: Mm-hmm!


Austin: So that’s a thing to know about Chine’s eyes. [Ali laughs] 


Dre: Uh huh.


Austin: Jet black eyes. Sick. Alright. I should give a little color here, which is that like as you’re walking through the town like this, the people who have awoken, this is probably the first time that you get that feeling of being watched as you move through town. Previously, maybe a couple of people have given you weird looks, but to be the group that gets called in the middle of the night for a reason that isn’t clear to most of the inhabitants of the town, and to see you all set out with all your gear and torches and lights and everything else, you do feel people peeking from behind the windows in the sort of way...I would say it’s hard to ascribe intention or to know what they’re thinking, but you have the experience of being perceived, however that hits you. Some of you want to be perceived. But there is a— that feeling, I know, is complicated, and that feeling is happening to you right now, you know, on your way up to this place. Anyway, back to the roll. No more characterization. Time to roll some fucking dice. [Sylvia laughs] So, you get one base one, relevant skill, helper. That’s three D6. Or, nope, three D10. Fuck. [Austin and Dre laugh] So, go ahead and give me a three D10. You rolled a seven, an eight, and a nine. We take your highest die. We don’t add them up. We take your highest die. If you roll an eight, a nine, or a ten, you succeed, fully succeed, no negative consequences. So, that nine is a full success.


Dre: Yay!


Austin: On a ten, you critically succeed, and you get a bonus, basically. You get to do a little bit more damage if you’re on a Delve or in a fight, or you kind of get a better outcome in a roll like this. With a nine, you get a full success, no negatives. We’ll talk about Stress and Failure when those come up. Between the two of you, I think you very quickly find some footprints. I think, you know, even with a full success, I think you can tell pretty quickly that this is three people, one of whom is a large, uh...they’re all humanoid. You can’t tell...I don’t think you can tell overall what species each of them is. But one of them has big heavy footprints, one of them has lighter footprints, and one of them has like middle footprints, right? And though you lose them here and there, you eventually find your way…find the kind of pathway up. And it kind of clicks into place that you are walking up to the observatory called the Weather Room, colloquially called the Weather Room, which we described back in our Ground Itself game. Keith came up with it. It’s basically an old observatory that has since become...just like the area around it is a hangout spot. [Dre laughs] In the middle of the night, it’s not often that people are there, but it is a long walk up there. But you’re able to pretty much determine, oh, that’s where these people are going. And what I'll say is it’s probably gonna take you...it’s gonna take you a few hours of climbing. I think we said it’s a six hour hike or something like that, and you can speed that up if you’d like to do a Delve roll to do it. And what I'll say is that doing this roll will let you basically be in charge of the situation when you get there. Alternatively, you can wait and get there kind of on...not the back foot, but that’s what we’d be rolling for, you know? You could just safely not do a Delve roll, get there, but not necessarily have the drop on the people who are up there. Up to y'all.


[0:21:03]


Sylvia: Really quick, this place has the same domains as Blackwick does, still?


Austin: This is Wild. We’re in a Wild domain.


Sylvia: Okay. Just Wild? Okay.


Austin: Because we’re up in the mountains, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I guess you could say, if you wanted to cut through the mines, that would be the Warren domain, probably?


Sylvia: Hmm.


Dre: I've got that.


Ali: Oh, I just picked that up.


Sylvia: I'm also pretty good with that, so.


Austin: Damn. y'all Warrened up. [Ali laughs] So yeah, maybe you cut through the mines. I would also say...I guess we… [sighs] Let me double check my notes. Have we said...are the mines also Cursed? I feel like they’re Cursed also.


Dre: I've got both of those. Let’s go. [laughs] 


Sylvia: We’ve talked about...didn’t we talk— I think this was my turn on the thing, where the fire shot out of the mine.


Austin: Yeah, uh huh.


Sylvia: In the Ground Itself. I almost said the year itself. I'm mixing it together with The Quiet Year now. [Ali laughs] 


Austin: With Quiet Year, yeah. Both good games, IMO.


Sylvia: Both great, yeah. So yeah, I think at the very least we had it so that the townspeople believed it was, on some level.


Austin: Right. Let me open my...


Ali: But did we not cure the curse and therefore it’s just Warren?


Austin: This is the thing, right?


Sylvia: Yeah.


Austin: This is true. This is true. You got me there.


Ali: You know?


Austin: Yeah, it’s Haven and Religion. It is not cursed at this point. The town is, anyway. But yeah, I'd say inside of this place, it’s Warren. And then I would say maybe it’s Occult in there or something, because still magic shit is happening, right? Maybe it is Cursed. Let’s just say, for now, let’s just say it’s definitely Warren, and we’ll play it by ear, [Sylvia and Ali laugh] depending on what the vibe is where you are inside of it--


Ali: If a curse comes up, you know.


Austin: Yeah, if it’s a cursed part of the place, you know?


Sylvia: This is the attitude I go through life with.


Austin: Me too. [Ali laughs] 


Sylvia: If a curse comes up, we’ll deal with it.


Austin: We’ll fucking deal with it. So yeah, if you want to cut through, I would let you do Delve Warren, for sure.


Ali: I can take that roll, if, um…


Austin: Yeah?


Ali: Yeah, if Dre doesn’t want to double up on… [laughs] 


Austin: I mean, if you’re both helping, it doesn’t matter, right?


Ali: Sure.


Sylvia: I'm able to help too.


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: Sure. I will let all three— I will let three, or two people help on this, because I think that...because we’re so far abstracting out this mini Delve that I feel it would be totally fine to go ahead and then take...so then here we go. Start with one die, one from Delve, one from Warren, that’s three, and then another two from people helping, with the note that a failure or a mixed success would give all of you stress.


Ali: Okay. And this is Standard?


Austin: That’s the risk here. Standard.


Ali: Okay, cool.


Sylvia: Just to have a little character thing, Virtue is mostly doing this so she can hopefully dig something up while they’re going through the tunnel. [Ali laughs]


Austin: Ooh! Okay. What are you— 


Sylvia: I, you know.


Austin: I mean, listen, if you want to make a separate roll by yourself to dig something up…


Sylvia: I think it’s more just like, oh, if I'm okay doing this thing where I dig with my hands [laughs]  'cause that’s her thing.


Austin: Yeah, yes.


Sylvia: Because we might unearth some weird thing that’s not supposed to be there while we do it.


Austin: Again, I will let you roll for that. I think— 


Sylvia: I'm down to roll to find some weird mountain shit.


Austin: I think if you’re doing this in a way that’s...are you voicing that you want to slow things down so you can see if you find anything cool?


Sylvia: [hesitant] Um…


Austin: Because if you are, then you can get help. Otherwise, you have to just roll this straight without help.


Sylvia: I like the idea of her just being like,


Sylvia (as Virtue): No, just give me...I'll be right there.


Austin: I'll be right with you, yeah, uh huh.


Ali: [chuckles] “I’ll check this path.”


Sylvia: Yeah.


Austin: Then yeah, give me a Delve Warren, here.


Sylvia: Okay.


Austin: Standard.


Sylvia: That’s eight.


Austin: Alright, that’s still a full success. Take no Stress. So yeah, you manage to find some sort of strange thing here. I'm gonna say...god, what is it? In my mind, it’s some sort of necklace. What’s an interesting out-of-time necklace to have found? Take a D6 Haven...actually, take a D6, um, let’s say Religion necklace. It is some sort of necklace that has the icon of a god that you don't know what it it is. What type of— what’s a fun icon to have?


Janine: Like an acrylic mustache pendant? [Sylvia laughs] 


Austin: No. I refuse this. [Janine and Dre laugh] Absolutely not.


Janine: What about one of those octopus necklaces that were everywhere?


Austin: No!


Sylvia: A replica Kingdom Hearts pendant. [Ali laughs] The one Sora wears.


Austin: Okay, it’s a key. You know what? It’s a key on a necklace.


Sylvia: Fuck yeah! [Janine laughs] 


Austin: Yeah, absolutely. Yes.


Dre: Shoot your shot, Sylvi.


Austin: Yeah, shoot your shot. There you go, uh huh.


Sylvia: You’re really just indulging me this season. [Ali laughs] 


Austin: I'm doing my best. So yeah, take that D6 religion.


Sylvia: Okay, cool.


Austin: So, between your efforts moving through this place, this dirty weird mine where sometimes you just hear singing in the distance, and sometimes it’s clearly the sound of miners singing work songs, and other times it’s songs with like rhythms you don't understand because they’re for styles of music that haven’t been invented yet, and they’re strange ghosts of future people deeper in the mines just hanging out doing a jam session. And you’re like, [laughs] “Alright, cool. I'm gonna keep on going up.” You eventually, and more quickly than you would have otherwise, find your way up to higher up in this cave system and come out while it is still nighttime out. The moon is large in the sky. We’re deep into the moon cycle at this point, so it’s very large, not at its fullest. Remember, the moon is always full in Sangfielle, it’s just how big it is that changes over the course of its cycle, and currently it’s pretty fucking big. And with all of that light, you’re able to see the Weather Room, this observatory that has some light on inside of it at this point. There’s like…you can hear as you approach, the sound of people—I'll say it outright, because you succeeded on these rolls to get the drop on them—celebrating. It’s the sound of people who like got a big paycheck and bought a bunch of booze and are like listening to music, or playing music I guess. Actually, maybe they bought, with some of their money they bought a phonograph player that came out of the mines [Sylvia laughs] and cranked it up, and they only have one record, because they couldn’t afford to also— they didn’t want to blow all their money, so they only got one record, but they’re playing it over and over again. And you can hear a voice that, Es, you recognize immediately as the devil bandit Agdeline, saying:


Austin (as Agdeline): Knock it off with that record already! We’ve heard it a thousand times.


Austin: And then you hear Larch say:


Austin (as Larch): I like it! I like the record! It’s good. I like the song! [Sylvia laughs] You play a song if you want to hear a different song!


Austin: And they’re arguing, and you also smell…you smell like roast pork that’s been roasted with a bunch of fruit so there's also kind of a sweetness in the air to it. And, you know, there’s the light of a campfire inside of this kind of ruined observatory coming out into the night sky. No one else seems to be up here, and it’s very easy for you to find a window in on these three people, who, to remind you, or for the group who did not deal with this trio of miners-turned-bandits before, this is: [testing pronunciation] Agdeline or Agdeline who is a devil lady; Ettel, who is a Drakkan, one of the seahorse folks; and Larch, who is a large human. And they are completely in celebratory mode. They seem to not have an egg sac with them, but very much have a lot of food and drink around them. They each have big bags of money and valuables out on a barrel as if it’s a table, just like, you know, basking in the glow of their success right now. And that’s the situation. What do y'all do?


Janine: Uh, I'm personally going to hang back, because I have a feeling that if they see us, seeing me in particular [Sylvia laughs] might hinder the chances of things going well in the conversation. [chuckles] 


Austin: Uh huh. Sure. 


Janine: I didn’t leave the best impression on them before. [Austin and Dre laugh] I left an impression, certainly.


Austin: You certainly left an impression, yeah! [Sylvia laughs] Yeah, you definitely did that.


Janine: Uh huh. It’s something she— 


Sylvia: I was gonna ask in chat if that was this group, but...


Janine: Mm-hmm.


Austin: Yeah, that’s this group. It is the group that the Roseroot Hall folks ran into on the way there.


[0:30:05]


Janine: You know, I left an impression where if they proved to not be in a good enough mood to carry conversation could still be helpful.


Austin: Yes.


Janine: But I don't think that’s the foot we want to lead off on.


Dre: Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay, what foot do we want to lead off on? Because if all we’re trying to do is get this thing back, like…


Janine: Who knows something about music? Anyone? Does anyone know anything good about records or pork or anything you could maybe commiserate over? [laughs] 


Sylvia: I'm afraid my taste might be a little out of date. [Ali and Janine laugh] 


Ali: I'm gonna be honest, I don't know that the play in there is to be like, “Smelled some pork. What’s up, everybody?” [all laugh]


Austin: Coming through!


Janine: You know, they’re a little drunk. They’re having fun. They might be a little generous.


Austin: They are, that’s true.


Ali: Well.


Sylvia: Rev up those fryers.


Janine: Sometimes when you get a big paycheck, you’re like, “I wanna make friends and buy ‘em all pork.” [Ali and Austin laugh]


Sylvia: You know what, that’s true.


Janine: Pork party. [Austin and Sylvia laugh]


Sylvia: Do we want to try and do this by talking to them or like...my skills, ironically, are not really suited to that, but we can figure it out.


Austin: So, Marn has Compel, but does not seem convinced that that is the vibe, so. [Ali laughs]


Sylvia: I do have, like, if we want other options, I have Sneak, and I do have a way to extinguish their light source with the new move I took.


Austin: Jesus christ.


Sylvia: That’s not that bad.


Dre: That sounds awesome.


Ali: This is a public area, though, right? So if, you know, if we just walked in…


Austin: It’s public, but it’s public in a way that’s like...you know, you’re hours away from town, right? It’s public in that on a busy day— 


Janine: It’s public in a way that makeout point is public. [Ali laughs] 


Austin: That’s correct. It’s exactly like that, yes.


Sylvia: Okay.


Austin: You’re supposed to stay in your car, you know?


Ali: Oh, sure, sure, sure. 


Austin: Most people don’t—


Ali: But they didn’t rent this hall. 


Austin: No!


Ali: If we walked in and were like, hey, you know, what’s the jam?


Austin: What are you doing here? 


Ali: Yeah.


Austin: The other thing is it’s 3 or 4 A.M., so it’s also like...why are— I think there’s a degree to which...you know, I'm outlining the ways in which it could go wrong. You should talk about how it could go right, and we’ll roll the dice and see  how it goes.


Ali: [laughs] We could just pretend to be, you know, on the way back home, hearing some beats in the distance and seeing what’s up at the…


Austin: Yeah, uh huh.


Ali: I'm gonna play this as casually as possible. The way that you look like you belong somewhere is believing that you belong there.


Austin: Yeah. Totally. Alright, well that sounds like Compel to me. I think this is Compel Haven, because you’re talking about just chilling with people, you know?


Ali: Uh huh.


Austin: You’re just trying to vibe out. Anyway. 


Ali: Yeah, I'm gonna roll this?


Austin: Compel Haven.


Ali: Compel Haven.


Austin: Yeah, is anyone helping with Compel or Haven?


Sylvia: I can’t. [Ali laughs]


Austin: You don't have it, yeah, uh huh.


Sylvia: I think I can’t learn Haven. I think that’s the one that’s blocked off for Deadwalker.


Austin: Oh, sure.


Janine: Sorry, what’s the plan again? Can we get a recap on…


Ali: I'm gonna walk in like I was heading home and I heard some jams and be like, “Hey, toss me a beer. What’s up, everybody? [Sylvia, Dre, and Austin laugh] What’s good, I'm parched.”


Austin: Uh huh.


Sylvia: The “beer me” gambit. I love it. [Ali and Austin laugh]


Austin: Ah, it’s very good.


Janine: I wanna help, but I don't know how I help while still hanging back.


Ali: Do you have that hat?


Austin: Yeah, I think compel does sort of require you to be seen.


Janine: Unless I give Marn my hat. [Dre laughs] To make her look more cazh.[1] [Ali and Sylvia laugh] 


Austin: Has that ever— well, what type of hat? What sort of hat makes you look more chill? Are you wearing a backwards fitted? Like, what’s going on? [all laugh] 


Sylvia: A Yankees no brim.


Austin: A Yankees no brim!


Ali: Oh, Yankees double brim. [laughter continues] 


Austin: Double brim. Brim all the way around!


Dre: Oh god. [someone claps]


Austin: Sorry. I think you have to— I think to Compel you have to do a verb, so.


Ali: Okay. I'm just gonna roll this then.


Austin: So that’s three dice, right? Three D10. Alright, there we go. Another success. Take no stress. Good rolls. What do you say as you come in? As the same song, which...god, I feel like it’s just kind of...in fact, I know where...they have a record from a place they shouldn’t have a record from. We’ve talked before about the Sleeping City where Art got— or where Duvall got all bugged up, has sort of a 19...you know, has kind of a jazz vibe in places, a very urbane, cool place. And so this is just some...they’ve listened to basically the same Miles Davis record like thirteen times in a row now. And I think Agdeline is also just not here for that kind of chill jazz vibe, and so that is what’s playing as you slink in here and take the lead. Chine and Virtue, are you also coming in with Marn? Or are you letting Marn go in solo, in terms of just like breaking the ice?


Sylvia: I have— 


Dre: I'm slinking around the outside.


Austin: Okay. 


Ali: Mmm.


Dre: In case they try to make a run for it.


Austin: Mmm, wise.


Sylvia: I think...I feel like it’s a bad idea for Marn to go in by herself.


Austin: Okay.


Sylvia: So if Chine’s— 


Austin: So Virtue’s going in with?


Sylvia: Yeah, I'll go in with Marn.


Austin: And then, Es, you are also hanging back still, outside? Okay. So, what do you say? How do you break the ice, Marn?


Ali: You know, I'm coming in. I'm all dusty. I have the mine cover, I'm being honest.


Austin: Yeah, true.


Ali: And I'm like:


Ali (as Marn): Hey, everybody. [Ali chuckles] 


Austin (as Agdeline): [surprised] What? We weren’t expecting visitors! Turn that down, Lurch!


Austin: And this is the Drakkan, who immediately buttons the top button of their shirt, and— [Sylvia laughs] 


Janine: It’s Larch, right? Not Lurch?


Austin: Larch, not Lurch. Sorry, I said Lurch. Larch.


Janine: [laughs] Okay.


Austin: Larch is the human. This is Ettel, the drakkan. And Ettel kind of straightens themselves out, and they’re like:


Austin (as Ettel): Mmm, okay. 


Austin: And like:


Austin (as Ettel): Pull up a seat, both of you!


Austin: And I think Agdeline gives them a look like...you better not be spittin’ game at these randos who rolled into our spot. [Ali laughs] And I think what she says is like:


Austin (as Agdeline): [wary] Visitors in the middle of the night! This is unexpected.


Ali (as Marn): Yeah, we were digging around in the mines for any leftovers and, you know, saw the lights up here and figured we’d pop in.


Austin (as Ettel): Oh, well we have leftovers.


Austin: Says Ettel, and points to like a big plate of...it’s not even a plate. It’s a serve yourself buffet [Ali laughs] of roast pork and rice and boiled fruit, and is just like:


Austin (as Ettel): Please, take a..


Austin: And they’re out of plates. Looks around, is like:


Austin (as Ettel): Dig in, if you want some leftovers.


Austin: Larch has turned the music up. [all laugh]


Austin (as Agdeline): Yes, take a seat. You’re dressed a little fancy for a miner.


Austin: Says Agdeline, looking at you, Virtue.


Sylvia (as Virtue): I'm the one investing in this expedition, and I wanted to, you know, make sure things were done properly.


Austin: Well, her eyes light up. [Ali laughs] 


Austin (as Agdeline): An investor!


Sylvia (as Virtue): I mean, well.


Austin (as Agdeline): Well, you’re looking at a group that is worth investing in, if I say so myself. We are coming off of an absolutely incredible success, and we are available for anything you need. We have references.


Sylvia (as Virtue): Oh!


Austin (as Agdeline): In fact, we’ve just secured a great deal of funding for ourselves, so if this is a situation where you would like to go in on some sort of new investment together, then perhaps we could find a way forward. [Sylvia chuckles]


Sylvia (as Virtue): Well, I can certainly see that you’re doing quite well for yourselves.


Sylvia: And she gestures towards the barrel with all the gold coins. [Austin and Ali laugh]


Austin: Yeah, the fact that there’s no table.


Sylvia: Yeah.


Austin: It’s just a bunch of barrels that have...yeah, uh huh.


Austin (as Agdeline): It’s a small kingdom, but it’s ours, you know?


Sylvia (as Virtue): It does seem like you’ve got quite a bit to celebrate, though. Are you sure you don't want to, you know, enjoy your latest success before immediately jumping into something new?


Ali (as Marn): Well, funding is hard to come by, so kudos to y'all.


Sylvia (as Virtue): Yeah.


Austin (as Ettel): [hesitates] Thank you. We, um…


Austin: And Ettel, I think, again, says:


Austin (as Ettel): We really went out on a limb. We took a job from some people we normally don't, and it paid off. What can I say? You know, I think we, uh, we gotta keep grinding, and we’re gonna eventually develop this whole outfit we got into something...you know what? Those Blackwick jerks ran us out of town. They said we’re no good. We’re gonna show them we’re better than no good. We’re...we’re no great!


Ali (as Marn): Hear, hear!


Sylvia (as Virtue): Yes, you show them.


Austin: Larch comes over with two beers, two bottles, and does the thing where he doesn’t have a bottle opener but puts them on the side of a barrel, [Ali laughs] puts them up against the barrel then pushes down quickly to open the bottle.


Dre: Oh, hell yeah.


Austin: You know, and hands you both a beer, and says—


Sylvia (as Virtue): I don't drink.


Sylvia: And she sort of waves it away.


[0:39:55]


Austin: Larch just nods, and then just, you know, starts drinking it instead and goes back over to sit next to the record player, the phonograph, and recranks it so that it has the energy to keep rolling. And then they start to ask you questions, and they say:


Austin (as Ettel): Well, how long have you been investing in this area? You here from when it was still the Folly?


Sylvia (as Virtue): No, I'm sort of new to the area. I feel like there’s a lot of untapped potential around Blackwick that these people just don't have the vision to see.


Austin (as Agdeline): I think that’s true.


Sylvia (as Virtue): But you, you all seem pretty savvy customers, if you ask me.


Austin (as Agdeline): You’re buttering us up, and I'll allow it, because it feels good. What I will say about Blackwick, and obviously we’re biased, is there are some people who’ve come to town recently who I think are a little bit of a problem. And so maybe, I think it would be a good idea to bring your money outside of town and look for a group who you could trust to get things done for you, like us.  At least keep us in mind.


Sylvia (as Virtue): Of course! I mean, you've already shown us such wonderful hospitality. It’d be hard not to. Though, I will say, you keep mentioning sort of this work you've done, but all I can see for now is the spoils of that work, and, well, quite a fun party.


Sylvia: She’s lying through her teeth, by the way. She hates this.


Austin: [laughs] Uh huh. Yes.


Austin (as Ettel): You know what they say, the proof is in the pork.


Sylvia (as Virtue): Well, sure. But if you could...and such wonderful pork it smells like, truly. But I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about what led to such celebrations. I mean, you mentioned references.


Austin: Give me a Compel roll.


Sylvia: Fuck! I knew it. 


Austin: Uh huh!


Sylvia: You know, whatever. That’s fine. [Austin laughs] Compel with a domain I don’t have?


Austin: Haven!


Sylvia: Yes, uh huh. Okay. One D6. Let’s go.


Austin: [laughs] A skill you don’t...well, is anyone helping? Does Marn want to help here?


Ali: I would love to, yeah.


Austin: Give you another die, here, Virtue. So that would be two D6.


Sylvia: Two D10.


Austin: Two D10! I keep saying six. What the fuck is wrong with me?


Sylvia: I do too! Look, we’re used to that.


Austin: We’re used to sixes. We’re used to sixes.


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Sylvia: Okay.


Austin: Now we’re conscious of it because of that document or that infographic, so we’re trying to say the dice names, and it’s fucking with us. [Sylvia laughs] Marn, how are you helping? Are you just echoing what Virtue said?


Ali: Yeah. Yep. I've been a part of this conversation. [Sylvia laughs] You know.


Austin: You failed this roll. Three and a six. Bad rolls, unfortunately.


Dre: Hell yeah.


Sylvia: Ahh, I tried!


Austin: Now we’re fucking talking. So, when you roll a one to a six, anywhere in there, you get a failure. I'm gonna just read from the thing again to try to make sure that we’re right. Oh, I'm sorry, actually. Six and seven is a mixed success. I thought the cutoff was at six. Its actually at five, so yeah.


Sylvia: Oh, okay. Cool.


Austin: Anything above five is a mixed success, at which point you get the thing you want, which is some information here, but you do take some stress. I'm gonna say that this is Fortune Stress, as you’re kind of just like...you know, you’re pushing your luck a little bit here, you know what I mean?


Sylvia: Yeah.


Austin: Bad luck, incompetence, and overconfidence is what goes to Fortune. And then this is a D4 Stress, I believe? Let me double check there. Yeah, D4, so I'm gonna roll a D4. This is for Virtue. 


Sylvia: [dismayed] Oh.


Austin: Virtue, take three Stress to Fortune, and Marn, take one Stress to Fortune. 


Ali: Okay.


Austin: I don't know, do either of you have Fortune Protection?


Ali: No.


Austin: I feel like no, right? Yeah, okay. When you take Stress in this game, any time it gets through, any time you don’t have Protection keeping it from hitting you, you then also need to roll a D12 to find out if you take Fallout. Fallout, if you listen, is when the bad stuff actually happens. So, in this case, the stress is just as you’re trying to talk through it, you’re getting some strange looks now and then as maybe you kind of stumble towards pushing a little too hard, but if you get Fallout, that will, you know, actualize in something bigger happening here. In order to test it, you have buttons that just say Test Fallout. What you’re looking to do is roll under— sorry, roll over the total number of Stress that you currently have. So for instance, Marn, you currently have three total Stress: one in Blood, one in Fortune, one in Supplies. So, as long as you don’t roll under three, you should be okay. So, go ahead and hit that. And likewise, Virtue.


Sylvia: Yeah, mine’s five.


Ali: Before I do that, I have a Fallout which is Collateral.


Austin: Ah! 


Ali: Which reads, “The next time you mark stress a nearby Ali—Ali. Ally—marks the same amount, and you then remove this Fallout.” So.


Austin: Uh huh. I'm gonna put this actually on...Chine and Es, are you watching from outside? Are you like peeking in a window?


Janine: Yeah?


Dre: Um, I'm probably not peeking in a window, but I'm definitely listening and trying to make sure, okay, do you want me to kick in a door?


Janine: Just standing under a window and listening to the convo bleed through?


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: Yeah.


Dre: I got big ears.


Austin: You do got big ears. I'm gonna say, actually, it bounces out to you, Es. Take one, also in Fortune.


Janine: Nope. I got one Protection in Fortune this time, so.


Austin: Well, there you go. Where’s that come from? Is that a move?


Janine: I have a move that I get to just pick where to put one something every session.


Austin: One Protection? Uh huh. Yeah.


Janine: And then I take it away at the end of the session.


Austin: Okay. So this session, it’s in Fortune.


Janine: Yeah.


Austin: Good to know. So then, yeah, the thing that’s happening here is you start to feel a little like, oh jeez, is this gonna pop off with this group again? And then no, they keep it calm, and so you keep it calm. Actually, Virtue, you also need to do a Fallout test. Oh, you did. You’re fine.


Sylvia: I rolled mine, yeah.


Austin: So, Marn has to do the Fallout test.


Ali: Yep, yep. 


Austin: Take Minor Fallout. [laughter]


Ali: I rolled a two.


Sylvia: Oh my god!


Ali: Just need to get higher than a three, and I rolled a two.


Austin: Just had to get— yeah. Just, yeah, that’s all you had to do here is that, and unfortunately, you got a Fallout. Okay, I think this is… [chuckles] Let’s see. Hmm. Is it a Fortune or is it a Mind? I think that this is a lot of lying back to back to back that is starting to get a little stressful for you, you know?


Ali: Mm-hmm.


Austin: Phew, this is a rough…these are all rough. One second. I feel like I'm looking at some stuff that’s harder than I want it to be. Okay. God, you know, it is what it is. I think they start to describe what’s happening, or what they did, because you got a success here. They say…they basically tell you the story, which is they spent the last little bit being toll collectors. They don't dress it up any more than that. It’s very clear that they’re bandits and proud of it. And then they got a job from these three big caprak, which are the goat people, who..they describe them as one of them having really big eyes, one of them having really big ears, and one of them having a really big mouth. And that none of them talked, but they all had letters with them that were pre-written and anticipating what the kind of conversation would be, in a way that feels weird, that they had an initial...they basically describe the situation in which they were given a letter that said, “We would like to hire you to do this job,” and then when they raised some questions about the job and how much they would be paid and et cetera, where they would need to do this drop off, they were given a second letter, as if all of their questions had already been anticipated. And then when they tried to renegotiate the terms or negotiate a higher pay, they got a third letter, that was basically like, you know, anticipating that and coming to an agreement that was within the right price range perfectly, and that that kind of blew them away. And somewhere in there one of them mentions that like, “and it wasn’t even that hard to get the damn egg!” So yeah, they completely spill the beans. Marn, the looseness with which they’re talking about doing things that...like, and they talk about knocking out the three guards in a way that’s so calm that you take the Mind Fallout, the Minor Mind Fallout Shaken: “You panic and fall back on your primitive impulses. I choose either fight, attack the problem in attempt to destroy it; flight, get away from the problem by any means necessarily; or freeze, do not act, putting yourself in danger. At the end of the situation, remove this fallout.” You’re going to freeze, as you suddenly realize that you’re in a room with people who are a little more dangerous than maybe you first thought. It’s one of those things where your eyes are like looking at where their weapons are, and you find yourself stammering a little bit, as you hope that Virtue can kind of take the lead here. [Ali laughs] So, you’re kind of frozen in place at this point. So. So yeah, they basically tell you straight up, they got this egg. And, Virtue, you’re noticing that Marn has completely shut up here.


[0:50:01]


Sylvia: Yeah. Ooh, I'm thinking. I'm trying to think of a thing that wouldn’t involve me talking more, [Ali laughs] because that’s getting us in a lot of trouble.


Austin: Mmm. Mm-hmm.


Sylvia (as Virtue): An egg, huh?


Austin (as Larch): More of an egg sac, right?


Austin: And the other two look at Larch, and he’s like:


Austin (as Larch): Well, it was an egg sac! It was like a sack of ‘em.


Austin: And they,


Austin (as Ettel): Yeah, it was an egg sac. That’s right.


Sylvia (as Virtue): Kind of a weird target, huh?


Austin (as Agdeline): People like strange— 


Sylvia (as Virtue): There’s eggs everywhere. Go get a chicken.


Austin (as Agdeline): [sighs] It wasn’t any egg. It was the Blackwick egg sac. You know, they built the little nest and the little covering for the rain and all of that. It’s gone now, isn’t it?


Ali (as Marn): Wasn’t that thing like important?


Austin: You cannot talk. [Ali laughs] 


Sylvia (as Virtue): Wasn’t that thing like important? [Dre laughs] 


Austin: Thank you.


Austin (as Agdeline): Yes, well, dinner is important too, isn’t it, dear?


Sylvia (as Virtue): I mean, no arguments here.


Sylvia: Out of character, I am at the point where I'm like how do I get the other two to help out now? [laughs] 


Austin: Mm-hmm.


Dre: I mean, I'll help, but me helping is probably inciting violence.


Sylvia: I guess I could, like...my other thing is asking where they went to drop it off, and that seems like another Compel thing.


Austin: That would be probably a roll, a final roll here, yeah, totally.


Sylvia: Yeah, so I don't really feel like risking fucking that up right now. [Ali laughs] 


Austin: You know, I will say that like, as a reminder, Compel also allows you to do things like intimidation. I guess if you don't have someone…


Janine: Do we want to escalate this? Is this where this is leading?


Austin: Yeah, that’s the question. That’s my question.


Janine: Because if we want to escalate this, I'll walk in. I’ll try Compel. I'll try an intimidation Compel and see how it goes.


Austin: Uh huh.


Janine: [laughs] If that’s where this is headed at this point, that’s fine.


Austin: You’re so close to not having to do that, which is so funny, you know?


Janine: Uh huh.


Sylvia: I do have a move here that would let me make it a success no matter what, but it’s like…


Austin: Mmm.


Sylvia: I'm wondering if I want to save that for when we’re actually past the info gathering stage.


Austin: That’s once a session, right?


Sylvia: Once a session, yeah.


Austin: Yeah.


Sylvia: It’s not once per situation, otherwise I'd be all over it. [Dre laughs]


Austin: Oh, sure, of course, of course. You could always roll the one die, fifty/fifty chance you get it. [laughs] Fifty/fifty chance it goes very bad.


Sylvia: [sarcastic] Oh, wow, great odds.


Austin: Uh huh. I'm looking at your moves to see if there’s anything else you can do here.


Sylvia: Yeah. I might just use Unorthodox Methods on this.


Austin: And just take the W and get that stress? 


Sylvia: Yeah.


Austin: Okay.


Sylvia: Yeah, I think...because it’ll get things moving.


Austin: It will, totally.


Sylvia: And we don’t need to be in this...weather house? Is that what it was called?


Austin: The Weather Room.


Sylvia: The Weather Room.


Austin: It’s an observatory, yeah.


Sylvia: We can get out of here pretty quick if I do this. So yeah.


Austin: So yeah, just go ahead and do it. I'm gonna roll my D4 Stress on you. You should take two stress. Again, put it in...mmm. Put it in Mind, as the process of needing to do this yourself is stressful, you know what I mean?


Sylvia: Okay.


Austin: You don’t have Compel. You don’t have Haven. It is difficult to make sure you’re not stumbling over...not stumbling over your words, but talking yourself into being found out, basically.


Sylvia: Not exactly used to talking with like this type of people is Virtue, you know?


Austin: Yes, exactly, exactly. And then give me a Fallout test.


Sylvia: Oh, right. Let me do that.


Austin: You’re getting up there, now. It’s totally possible that this breaks. Take Minor Fallout. You rolled a six, which is underneath your total of seven. So, let me give you your answer first, as you head out of here. You…


Sylvia: Should I— 


Austin: They eventually say— sorry, what were you going to say?


Sylvia: I was going to say, should I phrase the question the way she would or…?


Austin: Yeah, go ahead. You phrase the question, yes. Good call.


Sylvia (as Virtue): Well, that seems like something pretty important to get out of Blackwick on such, like, in such a secretive way. I mean, you couldn’t have just...I imagine you had to meet your employer somewhere or leave it somewhere for them, because the closer you leave it around here, the more prying eyes you’re gonna get, and nobody wants that.


Austin: And they say...Agdeline, she says:


Austin (as Agdeline): Well, I could tell you how to meet our client and give you my mark of recommendation, if you promise to pay me back with interest.


Austin: And you’re taking the Fallout Debtor: “During the next session or later in this one, an NPC who lent you money will call in a favor.” Obviously this is not money, but you’re basically indebted to Agdeline and to this trio, which could come up, probably not this session at this point, since you’re heading away from here, but in the future. I will post that text in the chat for you. And, again, we’re gonna read it very expansively here.


Sylvia: That’s a Supplies Fallout?


Austin: Yeah. And so she gives you basically a coin, a single coin made out of a cheap metal but that has this trio’s mark on it. And I don't know what that mark is yet. I haven’t decided. I need to think about what it is, ‘cause this is not a thing I knew existed until this second. Some sort of— they’re gonna need a cool name. I love them, and so now I need to know if they have a name for their gang. [Sylvia laughs] Uh...fuck. I don’t have one right now, but I'll come around to it. And they tell you that there is a…that those, the three caprak that they worked with and handed the egg sac off to earlier tonight, they came from a place to the south that people just call Yellowfield. It’s through the mountains or it’s over the mountains to get there. It’s, you know, probably the rest of the night’s journey, if not a little longer, depending on how you go. You can go over the mountains again, which would be another Wild domain, and it would probably be safe in the sense that it would be travel up where a lot of people do not go. Or you could, again, try to cut through these mountains, some of which are the Blackwick style they-have-weird-shit-in-them mountains, going again through a Warren-based place. They tell you in the conversation that Yellowfield has...they make a bunch of candles there. There’s a little village there. They’ve never been themselves, but they’ve heard of it. In fact, you probably know that there’s a common phrase that gets said about the Yellowfield Candle Company, which is...and you don’t know if this is, uh...what’s the word? What’s the word for “it’s a lie”?


Janine: Apocryphal?


Austin: Yeah, apocryphal or not, but it is commonly said that all the candles in Sangfielle were made with only twenty hands, and you don’t know if that’s true or not, but that’s what people say about the Yellowfield Candle Company. And so that is where they...they handed it off to three people, three caprak, who they describe increasingly as strange. Again, they talked about the big hands, big eyes stuff. But they’re also just like, they didn’t talk and they didn’t have...there’s a degree of like...they were very imposing figures, who even though they were making a business deal that seemed like it was completely smooth, they always felt a little afraid with them, and they kind of give you a heads up. They’re like, they’re imposing, but you know, don’t worry too much about it. It should go fine, blah blah blah blah blah. So yeah, that is where you’re heading. I will add it to the map at this point, because it is to the south. Grab both of these, layer, map layer, boom. You can now see that if you just cut down through the mountains, you will eventually come to this kind of place in between two of the mountains, a little valley basically, that cuts through the middle of Sangfielle. So that is where you’re headed. At this point, if you want to head out, you can head out, you know? I don’t think that they’re keeping you, and you say your goodbyes. And Marn, you can shake off that being too shook to say anything thing, and even say maybe a farewell as you step away. [chuckles] 


Janine: Can I do something for flavor? If that’s—


Austin: Absolutely.


Janine: Sorry, I didn’t want to cut anyone off if there was something else you wanted to do there. I wanted to tear a page out of my rat got notebook and leave a...not really get well soon card, but like a glad you’re feeling better card for Agdeline.


Austin: [laughs] Uh huh.


Janine: Just on the ground, beside the…maybe sort of pinned down with a rock so it won’t blow away.


Austin: Great. Perfect. She will find it tomorrow and be very confused. [Janine chuckles] So yeah. Again, your choice here is climb up over the mountains, which would be a longer but safer Delve, but also Wild, which we’ve established no one has Wild. Or cutting through the Cursed Warren interior of this place. I'm gonna say this is definitely Wursed, because you have to go deeper into the hills, or into the mines where...remember the Triadic Pyre has been paying people to go deep into the mines in a way that’s like, that part of it is still kind of creepy? You would be passing through parts of those that are like way deeper than even those people have gone into, because you’re coming at it from this other angle, that’s like not even the main Blackwick entrance. So I'm gonna say this is to pass through would be both Cursed and also Warren. But you’re better at those things, so maybe that’s the better call, up to y'all how you want to get down to Yellowfield. 


[01:00:22]


Dre: Yeah, I think—


Austin: Or if you want to go at all. Maybe y'all want to go back to Blackwick and be like, “Yeah, we know where the egg is. We did our job. Someone else go deal with it,” but that’s up to you. [Austin and Dre laugh] 


Sylvia: That would be a really bad ending to an episode. [Ali and Janine laugh]


Austin: Mm-hmm.


Ali: We could at least like go tomorrow morning, right? It’s like 4 A.M.


Austin: Up to you.


Janine: What?


Ali: I mean, just if we went back home and then went there tomorrow morning instead of in the middle of the night, but it doesn’t matter.


Janine: What does that—


Austin: Marn looking for some nap. Nap time. [Dre laughs] 


Janine: What does that get us materially?


Ali: A different option of traversing, but yeah, it doesn’t matter.


Janine: I guess.


Sylvia: I worry about going back to Blackwick, just because, like—


Dre: Same.


Sylvia: I'm worried about the trail getting cold...but like…


Dre: Yes, that’s my concern as well.


Sylvia: Yeah. That is mostly an out-of-character concern. I don't know that Virtue cares that much about bringing these people to justice, but yeah.


Ali: I guess we should do the thing that we have the skill in, then, ‘cause woods does not sound like our best option.


Austin: Like the vibe?


Ali: Yeah.


Austin: Yeah.


Janine: Yeah.


Austin: Alright, then you find...yeah, you find a route back into those caves, and basically, you know, begin to find your way southward with your compass and everything else. You know the general direction you’re going in here. And we’re gonna start a Delve. As a reminder, the way Delves work is they’re kind of like clocks that you’re filling in, in terms of how well you’re progressing through them. In most cases, they don’t have a visible HP clock. You don’t see it. But I have it written down in front of me. And yeah, it’s kind of like we go kind of bit by bit and have abstract montage style movement where you encounter individual obstacles, you roll once to overcome those obstacles, do some damage to the Delve, and move on. If something more focused or, you know, deeper comes up, then we can resolve that. If there’s a fight or a puzzle that needs a bunch of rolls or whatever, that can be a situation all on its own. In this case, I think that the Delve begins pretty smoothly, in terms of just, you’re making your way through these tunnels and stuff. Does anyone have any big idea for how to get through these tunnels more efficiently or anything like that that they would want to suggest before I introduce some complications?


Dre: Hmm.


Ali: Yeah, I don't know. We probably have lamps and scraping tools.


Austin: Yeah. All the classic stuff, sure. [Dre laughs] 


Ali: Uh huh.


Austin: You’re mostly finding routes that have already been taken, and it’s about finding the right kind of path through the already open tunnels in this cave system, more than needing to dig your way through it, which would in fact take you a thousand years, right? To go miles and miles.


Ali: Maybe we have some sort of horn or something to figure out which path is in a dead end.


Austin: Ooh, that’s fun. Yeah, I like that. [Ali laughs] That’s a fun image. Do you want to roll Delve Warren for that, actually?


Ali: Oh, sure.


Austin: That’s a good way of starting this out. Is anyone helping with the just kind of initial push through these mines?


Dre: Yeah, I will help.


Austin: Okay, so take another die from that, Marn. So, that is one base, then Delve, then Warren, then another bonus. That’s a bunch of dice. That’s four dice, and you get an eight, which is a complete success, no stress. Give me your Delve damage, which by default is D4, unless you have a tool that gives you Delve damage, which I don’t think you do. I don't think you have Delve equipment.


Ali: I don’t think so, no.


Austin: So yeah, just give me a D4.


Ali: That’s a four.


Austin: Damn. That’s very good. So yeah, you’re making your way through this very easily at this point, so we just get those shots of the crew kind of using this horn method. [chuckles] What’s the horn sound like?


Ali: Like a horn. [laughs] 


Austin: What’s that mean?


Janine: Like a high horn or like a low horn?


Austin: Is it low? Is like [imitating low horn sound] bwooooaaaa?


Janine: Is it clear? Is it kind of warbly?


Austin: Yeah, or is it like [imitating higher horn sound] bwaaaaaa, you know?


Dre: Sure.


Ali: Yeah.


Austin: Is it a trumpet sound? Is it a war horn?


Ali: It could be like a toot. Yeah.


Austin: Like a toot. [Ali laughs] 


Dre: Are the rims big? Do it ride good?


Austin: Right, exactly.


Sylvia: A clown horn.


Austin: [laughing] Is it a clown horn?


Ali: It’s probably one of those handheld situations but with the one loop so you can kind of hold on to it


Austin: Yeah, okay, sure. Sometimes as you move through, you hear yourself blowing into that horn from earlier, as it just echoes around in here without any loss and then catches up from behind you somehow? And you’re like, [chuckles] “that’s weird.” You reach a point where the ground starts to decline at an angle, and you’re like, “This is fine. We are totally in control of this.” And it’s like right at that perfect angle where it starts to go bad, but you can’t tell it’s gonna go bad. It’s like right at the angle where you’re like, “No, we have this. It’s not a problem,” but it is in fact a problem. And you can see some light from this tunnel below you, as you’re moving through this passageway, and it is kind of difficult to keep your footing. Who is taking the lead in this moment to kind of find the best path down this tunnel without people slipping and presumably taking some Blood Stress as they fall forward? Who is our point person on this? Who is rolling dice?


Dre: Yeah, I can do that.


Austin: Does that sound like a Chine thing?


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: Yeah. And then, is anyone helping Chine?


Sylvia: I can help out here.


Austin: Yeah? How are you helping?


Sylvia: So, like, we’re trying to keep from basically falling off the safe part.


Austin: Yeah, from losing your footing and falling down a...you know, it’s one of those things where if you fall, you’re going to keep falling at this point.


Sylvia: Maybe I could…‘cause the supply stat is basically for if you need a rope, you’ve got a rope, right?


Austin: Yeah, totally.


Sylvia: It could be a thing where I'm secured in place with, I don't know, some stake or something stuck in the ground. Not in any...don’t— 


Austin: Damn, that’s risky. [Ali laughs] 


Sylvia: Yeah.


Austin: Vampires just having stakes around feels like a dangerous…


Dre: Wildin’ out here.


Sylvia: Yeah, it’s pretty fucked up.


Janine: It might be metal.


Sylvia: Whatever.


Austin: Inviting trouble.


Sylvia: It didn’t take the first time. It’s fine.


Austin: Yeah, fair! [laughs] 


Sylvia: And she’s got the rope tied around her and is secured to that while Chine’s going forward or something like that.


Austin: That sounds right to me. Alright, so Chine, again, one plus Delve plus Warren plus another one is four D6. The other one is from help, just to be clear.


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: Yes. Damn, a nine! A one, a one, a one, a two, and a nine, but a nine nonetheless. [Ali and Dre laugh] And yeah, give me your...do you have a Delve? You do have a Delve piece of equipment.


Dre: Yes!


Austin: You have that compass that tracks where it was first picked up.


Dre: Uh huh, yeah.


Austin: Which is D6, so give me a D6 on this Delve.


Dre: Four.


Austin: Another four. Alright, you’re making good progress here. You come down to what that thing is, and this is not a situation, this is just color. That light that was coming up was from a river of metal, of liquid metal, molten metal, that you see, that is this kind of bright, glowing orange-red. And inside of the river, the liquid metal is solidifying— it’s actually not solidifying necessarily. Physical things, you know, solid things are popping up or bobbing up from underneath the liquid metal. Like, you know, a bucket pops up, a pot pops up, a flagpole— 


Dre: Hmm.


Austin: Kind of bobs up inside of the metal, the river, and then dips back down and kind of melts away. You see a collection of ball bearings floating on top of this thing, somehow not melting, and then coalescing and changing from those ball bearings into, you know, a wheel and then melting away into the raw liquid again. It’s very hot. You have to be very careful making your way around it, but you manage to get around that and come to a larger kind of part of this cave system where there is some natural light coming in as the sun is slowly begins to rise outside and there are some holes in the roof of this cave, and you just get that beautiful shot of some moss and flowers and stuff growing in this larger open area in the cave. Maybe there’s a little stream in here. Actually, maybe some of the liquid metal has kind of streamed off here, and the water part of it has kind of like— or, not the water part, but it slowly becomes just a little stream, but then little nails have washed up along the stream and, you know, the top of a hammer and some old coins. Stuff from the liquid metal part of the stream has come to rest here like sediment in this little stream that’s running through this little cave. And at the far end, you can hear the sound of an animal snoring. And at the far end of this cave, at the kind of exit that you need to take to get out on the other end, after hours of going through this system, is a huge animal. I would say it’s bigger than a utility van.


[01:10:42]


Dre: That’s big.


Austin: It sort of looks like a...I would compare it to a hippo or a rhino but bigger. A hippo’s probably closest. It has a huge kind of curved face, like the face just kind of comes out past the body and is almost as long as half of the body itself. It looks sort of like a whale, almost, like a land whale. Big, huge feet. And is currently kind of snoring in a way that’s echoing throughout this entire huge open cave zone, right? There’s kind of a cave garden, again, little wildflowers and stuff blooming in here, mushrooms, et cetera, very damp, but kind of pleasant after the tighter quarters that you were just walking through this whole time. And then, yeah, right near the exit is this big monstrous land whale. What do you do?


Dre: Hmm. Oh, I have a new move that might let me distract this thing.


Austin: Oh, word?


Dre: Yeah, so, after finishing that beat in the downtime, the new minor skill I've picked up is called Fractured Form.


Austin: Hmm.


Dre: It’s a twofer. So, first, my “flesh glistens with mirror shards that twitch and glitter to blur your silhouette. Gain the evade skill.” And, I guess because I'm shiny now, I attract small—


Austin: Also, wait, your—


Dre: Yeah, uh huh.


Austin: Wait, wait, wait. One more time.


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: Your flesh is covered with mirror shards?


Dre: Or at least it looks like it, yeah.


Austin: Oh yeah. But that’s a note we should take.


Dre: Uh huh, yeah.


Austin: Everyone, by the way, yesterday Chine’s face was not covered with a reflective material. [Ali laughs] Today, it is. Also, black eyes, again.


Dre: Mm-hmm! Listen, I had a dream, and things happened. [laughs] 


Austin: Uh huh! Things happened, and you woke up, yeah, uh huh.


Dre: Uh huh.


Austin: So, what’s the rest of that move? Besides, also, you get the evade skill, but then what else?


Dre: Yeah, so I honestly don’t know how these things are connected outside of just I'm shiny so now these things like me? [Sylvia laughs] 


Austin: Uh huh.


Dre: But, “small animals and insects are drawn to you and will perform your bidding to the best of their limited ability. Once per delve, you may use your adoring swarm as a piece of equipment.”


Austin: I love to have an adoring swarm. I'll tell you how they’re connected to the dream.


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: The adoring swarm are like...do you remember when you planted those teeth in the ground?


Dre: Yep.


Austin: It’s like loose teeth insects.


Dre: Cool. [chuckles] 


Austin: It’s like they crawl out of the ground, they like dig themselves out of the ground. They have little wings and can fly around you, but it’s just canines and molars, seemingly. They have...I don't know how close we want to get in on it, but they’re little teeth insects. What if insects were made of teeth? So like, right from your weird scrimshaw tooth art dream, here they are again.


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: And also, again, going back to that is the thing that first connected you to the Heart, is your attempt to plant that.


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: And yeah, or to the Course, I guess, in our case. Yeah, everybody got bug shit, Virtue, I'm sorry. [Ali laughs] It’s just how it is.


Sylvia: It’s fine.


Austin: Sorry you’re out on the bug moves.


Sylvia: I'm a corpse. I'm sure there’s some sort of bugs hanging around.


Austin: That’s probably true. [Dre laughs]


Ali: Can I ask sort of an important question?


Austin: Always.


Ali: [laughing] Do we get Es or Virtue like checking their hair in Chine’s back while he’s walking in front of them, because he’s now a reflective surface? [someone claps]


Sylvia: Oh my god.


Janine: Is it like a solid reflection or is it more of…is it like glitter? Is it like chunky glitter or is it like chrome?


Dre: Yeah, the reading says “they twitch and glitter,” so I think it is more that.


Ali: Oh, sure.


Janine: Oh.


Dre: It is not like a solid chromed out surface. [Austin sighs, then laughs] I see it, honestly, as a very...like, not full optic camo.


Austin: Yeah.


Dre: But things are just blurry around him sometimes.


Austin: Around you, yeah. I love that. That’s terrifying and good.


Dre: Mm-hmm!


Austin: So, your plan is to distract this land whale with the swarm, basically?


Dre: Yeah. With the bugs, yeah.


Austin: And then evade your way past, basically.


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: I like that. Do you want to...that sounds like an Evade to me.


Dre: Yep.


Austin: Everyone else good with letting this happen?


Janine: Sure.


Ali: Sure.


Sylvia: Sure.


Austin: Alright. Evade and Warren.


Dre: Warren.


Austin: Yeah. So that’s three dice, right? And two nines, here. Nine, nine, five. Love it. Yeah, what’s it look like? What’s this distraction look like?


Dre: Um…man. You know what, actually, I think this works not because the swarm causes any harm or anything.


Austin: Yeah.


Dre: But because this big beast fuckin’ loves to eat these bugs, dude.


Austin: [chuckles] Yeah. Uh huh.


Dre: This is a buffet.


Austin: Yeah.


Dre: And this thing is so happy. It is too happy to be bothered with us.


Austin: Totally. 


Dre: Just chomping away.


Austin: It is like opening its huge gullet and just running at them and trying to get as many in its mouth as possible with each charge.


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: As it moves, you hear the clanking of metal, and as you’re passing by it, you can see around its...i mean, I guess it’s the neck of this beast? is a shackle, is a collar that’s been broken. Or, the collar itself hasn’t, but there’s a huge metal chain. You know, again, it’s bigger than a van, so you have to think that these chain links are like shipping-grade chains, you know what I mean? 


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: You would dock a ship with this or anchor it, you know? And it’s loose, and it’s clearly been broken. And as you’re passing by, you do also— actually, you know what, I'm gonna say that’s what you get with that nine. If you had gotten that second ten, I would say you get a little bit more, or if you wanted to investigate further you could get more. But as you sneak past this thing, you do see that it seems to have freed itself from some sort of captivity.


Dre: You know what? I'm happy. I'm happy for it.


Austin: Okay. That’s it. You've gotten through this delve. Congrats on getting through this delve. You make your way through this last little bit of the tunnel, and you find your way...you kind of emerge into the light of day—sorry, Virtue, but the suns have risen. It’s early, still. It’s kind of an overcast day, so it’s not too bad—into a canyon pass. Actually, the first thing you see against this gray sky, floating up I guess between what would be the two suns, but you can't see them because it’s so overcast, is a collection of kites that have been tied down to a small kind of tiered temple structure that’s up on stilts. I guess it’s like what if a pagoda was up on stilts, like the very first level of it was even raised up off the ground. And sitting on, I want to say, like the third or fourth tier of this already very tall structure, is a person, just like legs hanging off the side of this temple, kind of kicking back and forth playfully, and she…I think that she sees maybe you come out, and she has a black cape of feathers on and one of those bird-like plague doctor masks and a big toothy grin as she sees people come out of the tunnel, and she just starts yelling:


Austin (as person): Guests! Guests! Guests! 


Austin: And you see three of the kites begin to come down, begin to be reeled down, and then the fourth one just breaks apart into a bunch of birds, and the birds scatter, kind of murmur around for a minute, and then they scatter off into the winds. And you’ve come to a Landmark. You’ve come to a Haunt called The Stilted Temple of Kaitankro. Kaitankro, one of the major religions of Sangfielle that we haven’t really seen on screen yet. And as you kind of get closer to this, you can kind of see that this is an old woman who is...you can see her as you get closer, but she’s well above you. She has not started coming down from this place to greet you or anything. But she’s literally running around the temple, and you can hear her footsteps, and you can see and maybe you can even smell that she’s put tea on. [Dre chuckles] She seems very excited at the prospect of having people walk past this very out of the way temple to a strange god. You can skip by here, but I will say this is a Haunt or a Landmark with a Haunt that does have some Haunts. It has some healing resources here for both Mind and Echo and Fortune. So I don't know if people want to take a stop here, see what’s up, or keep on moving south. Up to you.


[01:20:30]


Sylvia: Now, I very selfishly would want to use one of the Haunts here if it’s a Mind Haunt.


Austin: Oh yeah. It is a Mind Haunt. It is, in fact.


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Janine: I just don't want to disappoint that old lady. [Austin chuckles] 


Sylvia: Fair.


Janine: I don’t need any of the Haunt stuff, I'd just feel bad. [Dre laughs] 


Austin: Alright. So yeah, you make your way there. There is just a ladder up from the stilts up to that second...I guess, again, it’s the first floor of this temple, basically. And as you get closer, you can see that there are a bunch of other lines up to kites that are even further up, so far up, some of them, that they’re being lost in the cloud cover. And you can see that there are...you know, I don't think there are icons to Kaitankro, but there are, you know, other religious symbols. The kites themselves are sort of the icons. And as you get closer, you can smell that, yes, food has been put on for you all, tea is brewing. And then standing on that first level as you climb up that ladder into the temple itself, this little old woman...I'd say that she’s 70, 80, but moves around like a child, just sprinting back and forth with this plague doctor mask now pulled up over...she’s removed it but not removed it. She’s pulled it up like goggles almost, to reveal her big grinning face. She has kind of, you know, I would imagine that she has kind of wrinkled skin, white hair kept very short...and, in fact, not just kept short, but I think actually shaved. You know, she has a shaved head, but it’s back at peach fuzz level at this point. Big, you know, big happy eyes. And just immediately says:


Austin (as old woman): [excited] Welcome, welcome! Please, please, put your bags down. Take a seat.


Dre: Chine does not put his bags down. [laughs] 


Austin: Aww. 


Austin (as old woman): Please, be polite, put your bags down. [Austin and Ali laugh] 


Ali: What kind of Haunts was this again? I just wanted to…


Austin: So, this place has a Mind D8, which is basically having dinner or having a meal with this priestess. I'll write these down for you. And then it has a D6 Echo/Fortune, which is sacrificing something with the kites. Boom.


Ali: Oh, cool, cool, cool. Nice. I guess I put my stuff down.


Austin (as priestess): Sit, sit, sit!


Austin: And she says:


Austin (as priestess): Tea?


Ali (as Marn): Yeah?


Sylvia (as Virtue): Sure.


Dre (as Chine): What’s in it? [Ali and Janine chuckle]


Austin (as priestess): Little leaves!


Dre (as Chine): Okay.


Ali (as Marn): Oh, so the usual.


Austin (as priestess): Yes. [Ali laughs] 


Janine: I was gonna say, that implies some worrying stuff about the rest of the tea. [Austin laughs] Little leaf tea? I don't know about that. That’s not in…that’s not…


Austin: You’re not, yeah. You sure you’re not gonna playfully…


Janine: Uh uh, uh uh.


Austin: Okay.


Janine: I'm gonna say “thank you” and smile. It’ll be fine.


Austin: Okay, good. So, she claps [claps twice] and says:


Austin (as priestess): Tea!


Austin: And a crow flies down with a teapot in its claws, in its little claws, and somehow very carefully places it on a table that has already been perfectly set for five people, the four of you plus her. So there’s already cups and stuff here for the tea. And she looks at it and she goes:


Austin (as priestess): It’s hot. Give it a second. I don’t get many visitors. I'm sure you can’t tell. [laughs forcefully] [Janine chuckles] 


Sylvia (as Virtue): Never would have guessed.


Dre (as Chine): I like your bird. [Austin chuckles] 


Austin (as priestess): Thank you. He used to be a much better worker. Lazy these days.


Dre (as Chine): Well, how much are you paying him?


Austin (as priestess): You know, I haven’t given him a raise in quite some time. I think you might be onto something. [Ali chuckles] Okay, it’s good now. 


Austin: And then reaches over and begins to pour you each a cup of tea. 


Austin (as priestess): Where are you going? Tell me your stories.


Ali (as Marn): You know, we’re just passing through. We’re headed to, uh, Yellowfield.


Austin (as priestess): Mmm, Yellowfield, Yellowfield. [grimly] Lots of flowers. Hmm.


Austin: Shakes her head as if she’s just said something like...you know, something dire she has just told you, you know what I mean? [Ali laughs softly] Like, bad news, lots of flowers.


Dre (as Chine): You can’t trust ‘em.


Austin: [laughs] Exactly.


Austin (as priestess): I had a friend...hmm. I hope I have a friend who went to Yellowfield recently. Have not heard back in too long.


Ali (as Marn): Oh, yeah? Maybe they liked it, settled in.


Austin (as priestess): I doubt it. Bucho loves riding the Shape too much to settle down. He would settle down here with me, anyway, if he was going to settle down anyway. I take good care, like a grandma to him.


Ali (as Marn): Sure, yeah. This tea’s great.


Austin: It’s good tea. It’s just tea. Like, there’s nothing special about it, which I think speaks to what the Kaitankro religion is. I'm not gonna make y'all roll for like...again, it’s one of the bigger ones, it’s just not one of the ones that’s particularly associated with Havens, though this is a Haven place. If you needed to roll something at this place, it would be Religion and Haven, mostly because she’s such a good…she’s so hospitable as a host that it becomes Haven. Most other Kaitankro people...eh, you know, maybe they’re all good at this. Kaitankro is a religion about...I've said this before that the religions of Sangfielle are all trying to kind of figure out what to do in the face of the truth being so malleable and the world being so unhinged or unanchored, right? And the Kaitankro believers basically believe two things. One is: it’s better to be anchored to something than nothing. It’s better to be tied to community somewhere. Two: it’s better to still have some play and to still go with the flow to some degree, which is why the kite is such an important symbol in their religion, because it kind of goes with the wind even though it’s still anchored to the ground. And then, three: may as well go with the people who are nice. You may as well hang out with the nice people and be nice people. You may as well build a community. Why not build it with Kaitankro, the strange trickster crow god, who can be kind of a jerk sometimes but is also very funny and is, you know, themselves very malleable. 


Also, even the word Kaitankro is like...is it chitin crow, as in like the insect shell plus crow? Or is it kite and crow? You will get a different message or different answer from anyone you ask from this religion forever. Some people are very insistent it’s the insect shell thing, and they’ll say they’ve met Kaitankro, and when they met her she had a shell on. And someone else will say, “No, I met him, and he was just a regular— he was just a human wearing crow feathers.” Someone else will say, “Yeah, I met them, and they tightrope walked down a kite thing at me, and they’re a monkey person, actually. They’re like very much not a crow in any way at all.” Someone has said that Kaitankro is actually a spider, and spiders aren’t insects, and so you should keep that insect shit out of your mouth. And many of them just kind of go with the flow, but there’s a joy in the debate whenever you hear these people have this debate, where they all know none of them can know the truth, but its fun to kind of banter about it anyway. And that’s the vibe that you get from this woman, whose name is Rana, R-A-N-A, who is a priestess of Kaitankro. So yeah, there are these two Haunts. The first is this meal with the priestess. I think it’s framed as tea is free— she says it outright. Tea is free, but food and conversation cost a little bit more. She’ll tell you stories that she’s heard, she’ll share stories for donations to the temple, basically. And so yes, if you wanted to heal a Mind Fallout, for instance, Virtue, you would have to make a donation here to heal.


Sylvia: Yeah. Okay.


[1:30:00]


Austin: Is this a minor or is this a major? This is a major, isn’t it?


Sylvia: This is a major.


Austin: So a D8 resource to downgrade it to a minor, and then if you wanted to downgrade it further to nothing, you’d also have to do a D6.


Sylvia: Okay.


Austin: I don't know, what sort of resources do you have on hand at this point?


Sylvia: The only thing I have that’s a D8 or over is the Hymnal of the Mother-Beast, which is a D10.


Austin: Damn. You could give it up here. 


Sylvia: Yeah.


Austin: Which is so good in relation to it being...can you remind people what your Fallout is right now?


Sylvia: My Fallout is Despair: “Your mind races with the implications of what you’ve seen. Your life before seems unreal and distant. The GM picks a domain that you have access to, and you no longer have access to that domain,” which was Religion.


Austin: Mm-hmm.


Sylvia: I do kind of like the idea of Virtue, like...I'm trying to decide whether or not I want to give this up, but I do like the idea of her getting into some small talk about gods and stuff with this lady.


Austin: Yeah. Totally.


Sylvia: [sighs] I feel very hamstrung by this Fallout, is the thing.


Austin: It’s a rough one.


Sylvia: So I think I'm gonna go through with it.


Austin: Okay.


Sylvia: It’s really rough, especially considering how I built my character. [laughs] 


Austin: Yes. Yes. A hundred percent. Here’s what I'm gonna tell you I'll downgrade it into, so that you can have an option here in terms of if you wanted to keep donating.


Sylvia: Sure.


Austin: Also, wait, wait, wait. There’s another thing you could do. You could donate smaller things up to D8. So you could donate both of your D6s, which would become a D8.


Sylvia: Ohh.


Austin: So you don’t need to donate a single thing. You could make multiple spends, do you know what I mean? So let me offer that first.


Sylvia: Yeah.


Austin: Before you give up the Hymnal of the Mother-Beast, because I know that’s an important story thing for you.


Sylvia: Yeah.


Austin: What I was going to say is that major Fallout will reduce down to the minor Fallout Fascination: “You become obsessed with a strange topic, usually whatever caused the Fallout. You must try and learn more about it, firsthand when possible. Whenever you attempt to learn more about your weird fascination, roll with mastery. If you have the opportunity to learn about it and refuse, mark D4 Stress to Mind.” And that would be religions that are off the beaten path, do you know what I mean?


Sylvia: Yeah.


Austin: It would be under-studied religions, basically.


Sylvia: Okay. I think I'm gonna do that, and I actually think I am gonna do the two resources thing.


Austin: Okay.


Sylvia: I have...I'm trying to think of these because she wants to talk about stories and stuff.


Austin: Yeah.


Sylvia: Like, what stories is she telling with these? I think one of them is just the bag of interesting teeth. She’s just going through and naming what each thing belongs to. [Sylvia and Austin laugh] 


Austin: Yeah, exactly. This is a wolf. This is a...yeah. This is a pig. Uh huh.


Sylvia: This is my ex.


Austin: [laughing] I was gonna say, yeah. This is a person. Exactly, yeah, this is my ex. Ahh.


Sylvia: Yeah, and then the other thing I'm gonna give her is the Shape-touched chalk, which I think would just…


Austin: Mmm.


Sylvia: Actually, hmm. Well, no. I'm gonna give the key pendant, ‘cause otherwise I just have religion stuff, then.


Austin: Sure. She takes the key pendant, and she says:


Austin (as Rana): I'd wondered where I'd left this!


Austin: And puts it around her neck.


Sylvia (as Virtue): Apparently, in the mountain. You’re welcome.


Austin (as Rana): Thank you.


Austin: Alright, so yeah, go ahead and reduce that, get rid of that terrible Fallout that lets you not have the Religion domain, and instead take the Fascination, “you become obsessed” one. I'll paste the text in the chat. And, again, we’re gonna call that like, you know, strange religions or religions you don’t know— it’s not just that you don’t know about them, because I don't know what you know about like the Triadic Pyre.


Sylvia: Yeah.


Austin: But it’s specifically minor religions, let’s say.


Sylvia: Okay.


Austin: Inside of Sangfielle. Anyone else looking to heal up, here? 


Ali: Yeah, I actually have two housekeeping questions.


Austin: Yes. 


Ali: Which is...I have a move called Forewarned and Forearmed. 


Austin: Yes.


Ali: Which is “Once per session, when you have an hour or two to spare in a Landmark, you can make preparations for the upcoming challenges.”


Austin: Mm-hmm.


Ali: And then there’s benefits that I can pick. I was gonna go with One for the Road, which is plus one Mind Protection.


Austin: Mm-hmm. Yeah. What’s that look like?


Ali: I feel like sitting down and having tea with someone is the spirit of what that is.


Austin: Yeah, totally. So, everyone take plus one Mind Protection through the end of the...you know what, I'm gonna say you do this on the way out, basically, so it’s basically…I'm basically gonna let you have this for the next scenario, you know what I mean? When you get to Yellowfield, this will still count, because you’re basically at Yellowfield now, you’re just at the outskirts of it.


Ali: Oh, okay, yeah.


Austin: ‘Cause the way it’s written is a little weird. Just for listeners, the way it’s written is like “the next time you enter a landmark…” you get it until the next time you enter a landmark, but you’re basically at the landmark, you’re just at the outskirts of it now, so I want this to count for the rest of this scenario, you know?


Ali: Okay, sure, yeah.


Austin: What’s the other one?


Ali: And then the second thing was I was going to ask if I could donate my hide of the Mother-Beast and thread of the Mother-Beast to make a kite to clear my Fortune Stress?


Austin: Oooh, yes, I love that.


Ali: Yay.


Austin: So, roll a D6.


Ali: Oh, okay.


Austin: Oh, you only have one Fortune Stress, right?


Ali: Yeah.


Austin: So then yeah, you get it, that’s fine. In fact, you don’t need to...I love that image so much, [Ali laughs] but don't… [sighs] 


Ali: I do too.


Austin: But you don’t have to lose two...I guess they’re both Cursed and Taboo, so you know what? I think I'm gonna make you do it, so that we can keep the good idea. [Ali laughs] Again, for the audience, Ali’s overpaying because she only has one Fortune Stress and one of those would have paid for that, but they do both have Taboo, and I think making the kite un-taboos it, you know what I mean?


Ali: Oh, sure, sure, sure. Yeah, I— 


Austin: It’s like, yeah, you’ve done the thing. This is perfect. [Ali laughs] Alright. Anyone else want to do anything? You know what, I'll give you a little bit more here too, in terms of...you’re going to put that kite up, right? And she leads you up all of the ladders to the very top of this place where all the kites are connected and has you begin to reel it out, basically, until it catches the wind. And when it does, you realize that you can see down from here into the valley, into where Yellowfield is. And I think, while looking down at it, you get a little bit of a story about it from the priestess here. She says, you know, as you’re looking down at it, she says:


Austin (as Rana): The story goes that after the Panic, this little valley of—


Austin: Actually, I'm wrong. It’s not after, it’s before. She says:


Austin (as Rana): Before the Panic, this little yellow valley of flowers belonged to a wizard, a petty little man. He called it his Xanthic Demesne. These days it is just called Yellowfield. [sighs] The story goes that after the Panic, his subjects turned on him. Once they were frightened or beguiled, but in an era of magic and supernatural strangeness, his magic did not cow them. And so they took over the field and built the factory. Perhaps with a little help from the Shape, which was young then. Decades after that, the church was built, and the leader of the church took over. And then she lost power, and the factory foreman took control. And then they lost power and the village elder took over. And for the decades that followed, that cycle has continued. Today, it is a man of the cloth who runs the village, High Vicar Regan Alaway. Kaitankro tells me there’s more to the story than that. I'd hoped that Bucho would come back and tell me about it after his visit, but he has not returned.


Dre (as Chine): Maybe he took over.


Austin (as Rana): Maybe! He doesn’t seem like much for leadership. More of a man of derring-do! If you could find him, I would appreciate it.


Austin: This is me noting, briefly, that Chine, you have “perform an act of service to an NPC witch.”


Dre: Oh, yeah.


Austin: So, keep that in mind


Dre: I think Chine kind of sighs and says:


Dre (as Chine): [sighs] What does he look like?


Austin (as Rana): Oh, you would not miss him. A big man, a devil. Big, beautiful horns. And you would see him because of the huge walking armor tank he lives inside of. He’s a Shape Knight!


Dre (as Chine): Ah. Okay, yeah, no. Hard to miss.


Austin (as Rana): Hard to miss.


Dre (as Chine): How do you say that name again?


Austin (as Rana): Bucho! 


Dre (as Chine): Okay.


Austin (as Rana): B-U-C-H-O. Bucho. Two-Step Bucho. Sometimes called…


Austin: There’s another one. There’s another one. What’s the other one I've written down here somewhere? I thought I said it earlier. Oh!


Austin (as Rana): Big Bucho. [chuckles] 


Dre: [laughing] Big Bucho.


Dre (as Chine): Alright. I'll find Big Boochie, and—


Austin (as Rana): Bucho!


Dre (as Chine): Bucho. [Sylvia laughs] What if he doesn’t want to come back? What if he’s in charge?


Austin (as Rana): Oh, just tell me...just ask him to give you something that would let me know he’s okay. We’re old friends.


Dre (as Chine): Yeah, okay. Alright, we’ll find him.


Austin (as Rana): Thank you for your company. I would love if you visit again. Send your friends, also. It gets very boring up here.


Sylvia (as Virtue): Yes, well, I do hope you find some way to entertain yourself. Take care.
