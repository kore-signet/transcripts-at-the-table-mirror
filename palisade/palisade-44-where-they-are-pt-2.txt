Recap [00:00:00]
Austin: PALISADE is a show about empire, revolution, settler colonialism, politics, religion, war, and the many consequences thereof. For a full list of content warnings, please check the episode description.
Austin (as Volition): I can’t speak for your Divines. We are proximal, but… separate. Not scattered here in the Mirage. We simply like where we are. 
[music intro - “Nothing is Stationary” by Jack de Quidt begins]
But that does not mean we don’t come into orbit with one another, sometimes. But I sense that your Divines are… different.
Janine (as Thisbe): I do not think they all like where they are.
Austin (as Volition): What do you think holds them where they are?
Janine (as Thisbe): Subjection.
Austin (as Volition): Whose power is greater than a Divine’s?
[beat]
Austin (as Jesset): [sighs] You ever just feel like, uh… you’re never going to get to stop moving? You know, like they say a shark—a shark always has to move. Do you ever have that?
[beat]
Austin: In that same pose as a ghost haunting Clem; in that same pose over in Figure’s room, haunting Figure; in that same pose looking up at the stars, trying to make sense of the various gods that they served — or thought they served, or believed they were working for, or towards —; in preaching to the Divine Principality; in preaching about the New Asterism; in preaching about Palisade and the Twilight Mirage. And you’re flipping through them, and eventually you see one where they’re still in that same pose — arms out, robes, you know, hanging low, wide, big arms — and then around them, people are being killed. And you don’t… you don’t recognize the exact place, but we do, and it is the Isle of the Broken Key.
[beat]
Sylvi: If I’m visualizing this, she’s got like, the big Studio Ghibli tears pouring down her face [Austin: Uh-huh!] while she’s, like, reaching with both hands to try and grasp Perennial’s.
Austin: Oh… Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sylvi: Like, frantically. “I’m not gonna stop fighting if you won’t. Let me show you that this isn’t lost,” you know?
Austin: And I think that you get a… You know, Perennial is… a very aloof god, and so does not get a lot of direct communication. Going back to Clem, even, it wasn’t like big long debates at night, you know? [chuckles]
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: You know, long… communion. There’s a “what do you want me to fucking do, goddamn it? Tell me,” about dealing with Perennial. And so you don’t get any— but you do get the sign. You do get the sign of the Russian sage regrowing, and regrowing in this kind of black and this color of grief. But it’s alive.
Sylvi: Hell yeah it is!
[“Nothing is Stationary” concludes]
Introduction [00:03:07]
Austin: Alright. Who… [chuckles] We got one scene down! Who's next?
Ali:  [overlapping] Wahau!
Sylvi: [overlapping] It would… We kinda got to… That kind of…
Austin: [overlapping] Are you… I mean, if that’s yours… If you want that to be yours, I’m fine with that. Because that is…
Sylvi: We can see.
Austin: Okay.
Sylvi: I don't know…
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] That was the big thing I had for today.
Austin: I'm fine with that.
Sylvi: Um. So, you know.
Austin: Good.
Art: Otherwise, we're on pace for this to take a loong… [chuckles]
Austin: Yeah. Well, that Move had a lot of space for other people's Moves. You know? So… Do we want to jump to a Jack or an Art scene? Since everybody else got to go do something on this previous one? I guess that's not true because Dre was not there. So we could do a Dre, Jack, or Art. But let's do a Jack or Art because there's less of a chance that it will intersect with the primary Blue Channel cast. And so… And start there.
Jack: Yeah…
Art: How you feeling?
Jack: I could go, but I could also… You could also go.
Austin: [whispers] That’s… [sighs]
Sylvi: [laughs]
Art: I don't think I could go.
Jack: Okay. Okay. [overlapping] Sounds…
Keith: [overlapping] Last Month Art is still warring with Shower Art.
Art: Yeah.
Jack: [chuckles] You’re doing great, Art.
Austin: [chuckles]
Jack: Um…
Art: But which Art are you talking about?!?
Keith: [laughs]
Jack: Both. Both.
Austin: Steel sharpens steel, my man.
Art: [laughs]
Jack: [laughs] Austin, why did you say “Steel sharpens steel, my man” like you were a medieval merchant talking to another merchant?
[others laugh]
Keith: Playing a lot of Dragon's Dogma!
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] A lot of Dragon's Dogma; Realis coming soon…!
Jack: “Steel sharpens steel, my man!” [overlapping] “Hm. Wise, wise.”
Austin: [overlapping] Mirador Cantato would definitely say “Steel sharpens steel, my man!”
Jack: “Steel sharpens steel, my man!” — boos from the rest of the party. [chuckles]
Austin: Yeah. And “No, I will not tell you anything about this quest we're on.”
Jack: [chuckles]
Austin: Get ready! Get ready for Realis, everybody. Alright.
Jack’s scene [00:04:44]
Jack: Okay. I would like… a conversation that leads into…
Jack: I figured… I sat down and I wrote a document called “possible”...
Austin: Oh, Jack.
Jack: … “possible scenes”. And then I wrote the first one and was, like: “Oh it's that!”
Austin: Hm. Uhum.
Jack: So…
Keith: Oh, so you didn't get to “impossible scenes” and then pick one of those?
Austin: [chuckles]
Jack: No, no. I would like to play a Faction Turn… game.
Austin: Sure.
Jack: I figured, you know, if it ain't broke don't fix it.
Austin: Yeah!
Jack: But I would like to preface it with a conversation.
Austin: Okay.
Jack: I would like… I think…
Austin: Not the Move A Conversation. Not…
Jack: [overlapping] No, no…
Dre: [laughs] 
Austin: [overlapping] … the scene from Firebrands: A Conversation. Just actual an human conversation that we are having. Okay.
Jack: [overlapping] An actual human conversation that we are having.
Austin: Sure.
Jack: I think that… Maybe the morning after the bombs go off. You know?
Austin: Uhum.
Jack: Maybe… Maybe at the exact same moment that Brnine is having their “how's everybody doing – let's take an off day – Jesset, fetch me some juice” [laughs] conversation.
Art: [chuckles] [overlapping] That’s what happened.
Jack: [overlapping] “A man possessed by the spirit of one of the evil Divines, bring me the juice.” Um. At about that same time I think that General Tomorrow Morning the envoy of the Twilight Mirage on Palisade who… as a quick recap is a kind of philosopher general…? She is a Qui Err woman who has devoted her life to the theory and practice of war as it is fought inside a utopia.
We've said, I think, on recordings before that to categorize the Twilight Mirage as a completely peaceful place — especially now — would be a mistake. The Twilight Mirage has always, you know, even… Prior to the events of Twilight Mirage, during the events of Twilight Mirage, and after has seen disagreements that have broken out into skirmishes… there have been… there has been… I don't think that there's been, like, a full-scale war, but there's been conflict within the Twilight Mirage.
And I think that something that we kept coming back to inside Twilight Mirage — along with conversations of “what does meaningful pacifism mean?” — is, you know, “what does it mean to defend Utopia?” What does it mean when you have to say “there are certain ideologies that we will not stand for or we will not allow to grow”? And, I mean, that in part leads to… a huge point of tension in the Orbital game, as, I think, rightfully, the Twilight Mirage is called out for their inaction.
And so following this… General Tomorrow Morning is dispatched first from the planet Senechal to the Brink to go [chuckles] “what the fucking is happening here” and then from the Brink to Palisade itself. And when we last saw her she was sort of dispatching Twilight Mirage units into the broader structure of the Cause.
But I have imagined that she has been spending a lot of her time um with one August Righteousness — the sort of… I don't know if I would say de facto head but August Righteousness is involved in a lot of the military and logistical and sort of structural operations of the Cause? That's correct, right?
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. One of the… You know, we've talked a few times about how every member… Every, you know, Division of the Cause, every Faction of the Cause has kind of a rep at the big… group decision-making meetings? And… August is the head of the Jade Kill one. And also is the one who is, like, [overlapping] “I was already part of a militarized Movement here.”
Jack: [overlapping] This is what’s important.
Austin: [overlapping] You know? On Palisade proper. Yeah.
Jack: [overlapping] I think this is… part of why Mourning has sort of begun working very closely with him — and I say begun, you know, she's been working with him since she arrived on Twilight Mirage — is who is doing the work already. Who has been doing the work already. Who can we best help and who can best sort of guide the resources that we are able to provide. Um. August Righteousness is of course a Delegate of the Divine Righteousness, an uncomplicated Divine. [chuckles] Uh…
Austin: [giggles] Uhum…
Jack: And I think…
Austin: Simple. Yeah. I… No response. Yeah. Uncomplicated, very simple Divine, Righteousness.
Jack: Last seen… a thread, weaving through a briefcase.
Austin: On Altar. But obviously, somewhere else now. Right?
Jack: Yeah. And I don't… I don't know where that is.
Austin: Somewhere on Palisade, presumably. If there… current Delegates being made!
Jack: Yeah. Yeah, that's true! God!
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Jack: [overlapping] Righteousness is on the planet somewhere.
Austin: [overlapping] Along with Opposition. Along with all the big list of Delegates. Yeah.
Jack: Oh, we're in trouble. [chuckles]
Austin: Hm. [chuckles]
Jack: And it is with a certain… feeling of that that I think Tomorrow Mourning arrives in August Righteousness’s… Does he have an office? Does he have…? Where does he…? Where does he do work that's not, you know, out in the field?
Austin: Great question. I think that there's probably a, like, a command room. You know? Somewhere in Joyous Guard. You know. I think the most August Righteousness thing to do would be to convert the throne room into a sort of, like, open Command Center?
Jack: [overlapping] Yeah! God.
Austin: [overlapping] You know, the throne room of the Duke. The Duke of Glass who is from Fabriel Duchy, who was being held hostage for quite some time here — maybe still is being held hostage here? [chuckles]
Jack: I think still! [overlapping] We don't know where…
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. I don't believe they ever… Fabriel Duchy never… never got him back. And so, yeah. They converted that throne room into a kind of Command Center.
Jack: And I think in the early days the throne itself, or what was left of the throne… took some sort of… intentionally symbolic role? You know. It was being appropriated for “x”.
Austin: Uhum.
Jack: Or it was being used for “y”. But as time went on and the war grew on, the throne now just has, like, a folding table placed over it.
Austin: [chuckles]
Jack: And, like, books. It has become an unintentional symbol. It’s transitioned from the intentional to the unintentional.
Austin: Uh-huh. Yeah.
Jack: And I think Tomorrow Mourning comes in to see August Righteousness and she's wearing her usual, like, black and gray. I think that… She's wearing, like, a flash of color in, like, a pin or something. And she has the sort of vaguely guilty vibe of someone who, with a degree of solemnity left her home behind and is now enjoying on some level the proximity to it again. She is, you know… There is a pep in her step in being back in the Mirage. Even though she recognizes that it's a headache.
Austin: Does anybody want to play August Righteousness who isn't me?
[pause]
Austin: I'm happy to, but…
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Ali: I stan him, so I don't want to play him.
Keith: I just don't think I have a handle on August Righteousness.
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: That's fine.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah, same where I’m at.
Austin: [overlapping] What's Mourning show up with? Is this like, a…
Jack: [overlapping] A notebook.
Austin: Okay. Classic.
Jack (as Tomorrow Mourning): Good morning, August. Are your people accounted for?
Austin (as August Righteousness): As far as I can tell, we're all here. Some worse from wear… worse for wear. We're putting in the work to get everybody back on… on their feet.
Tomorrow Mourning: It's going to be a long day… And I would appreciate it if you could give me a few minutes of your time in the morning.
August Righteousness: What's this mean for us?
Tomorrow Mourning: That's part of what I want to talk to you about. We are in a position where I think that if we don't move quickly, The Principality will. And I think that I would like to try and take this time to begin to nail down some operative strategies with you, so that we can move [overlapping] together in a…
August Righteousness: [overlapping] Sorry, you’ve misunderstood what I mean. You think of us as being in your jurisdiction now?
[pause]
August Righteousness: You’re using “we” an awful lot.
Tomorrow Mourning: I apologize if it comes across that way. I intended to use “we” to refer to your organization and mine.
August Righteousness: Alright. You do get my worry, right?
Tomorrow Mourning: Of course I do. Over and over again you have seen and… we have seen, collectively, on Palisade and elsewhere these kinds of moments being appropriated. Or…
[pause]
August Righteousness: Sorry. [aside] Tell her we can send seventeen. We don't have eighteen. Seventeen is what we can send. Alright. [back to Mourning] Sorry. What were you saying?
Tomorrow Mourning: We're in an immense position of strength here… while The Principality still exists on the planet a careful application of force from the Twilight Mirage — which I understand they would be prepared to provide — could, in combination with you, end this war this afternoon. The more interesting question is what follows.
I have absolutely no interest, and in fact, I've spent my career ensuring that… this planet would not fall under Twilight Mirage's jurisdiction. And any further search for justice or equity would be led by the people who have suffered the most greatly under The Principality — that is to say: yourself, the people on the planet Palisade, and the revolutionaries of Millennium Break. Of course the Twilight Mirage would be involved, as this affects the ongoing safety of the Mirage… almost as much as anything else.
Austin: Jack? Oh shit. Sorry! My audio just slowly muted as you were talking.
Jack: [overlapping] Oh, wow!
Dre: [overlapping] Oooh.
Keith: [overlapping] Oh, weird!
Austin: It was wild! It was, like, you were getting further and further away… [overlapping] and I was…
Jack: [overlapping] More and more distant…!
Sylvi: Oh no…!
Austin: I was…! It was truly, like, I am in August Righteousness's head [laughs] as…
Jack: [laughs]
Austin: … this person is blathering on…
Keith: [chuckles]
Austin: … and I'm worried about if my people are dying right now. It was very funny. I don't know how I did that! I don't know if I hit a button…? I'm just scrolling up and down on my PDF and somehow I lowered my volume — very slowly!
[00:15:02]
Austin: You were falling into a cave! It was so funny. [overlapping] Would you say what you just said?
Jack: [overlapping] It's a Drink Girlies all over again.
Austin: Yeah. Uh-huh!
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: She essentially laid out that she has spent her career ensuring that, you know, the… the crack that has been presented here does not have a knife slid into it and opened up further [overlapping] for colonization by the Twilight Mirage.
Austin: [overlapping] Right. By the Qui Err, or…
Jack: Any process of justice or equity uh that is going to [overlapping] follow needs to be led by…
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. That part I got. It was truly just the very end that I didn't hear. Yeah. It was very funny. I think August is, like:
August Righteousness: You're saying all the right words. Um… [sighs] “It could be over today.” “The right application of force.” Well, what's the right application? Let's do it.
Tomorrow Mourning: Okay. The first thing I propose uh is that we call for an immediate temporary blockade of Palisade. By combined Cause and Mirage units. I would imagine that Principality criminals are likely to attempt to flee into the Mirage — they may have begun to do so already. This blockade would not represent an occupation. The presence of the Twilight Mirage on the planet would be something that I would negotiate with…
August Righteousness: I can't say yes to this! This is nothing I can say yes to. [overlapping] I mean, I can…
Tomorrow Mourning: [overlapping] Can we bring it to The Cause this afternoon?
August Righteousness: We should. You might not get the votes. I'll back it.
Tomorrow Mourning: Okay. Um…
August Righteousness: But I… Do we need to move quicker than that?
Tomorrow Mourning: How quickly can we meet The Cause?
August Righteousness: We need… We need quorum. Um. Sometimes people drag their feet. I'll send word. Can we…?
Austin: And, like, makes a hand signal to somebody.
August Righteousness: We're going to get it up as quickly as we can.
Tomorrow Mourning: I know that you understand as I do that they are taking advantage of this as quickly as we are. And we need to beat them to it. With that in mind — and again this is something I'm prepared to negotiate — would you be willing to accept the deployment of Mirage assistance immediately on the planet?
August Righteousness: [sighs] You came to me because you know I want it the most.
Tomorrow Mourning: That might be so. Our presence in the Mirage has enabled a speed of communication that we didn't have before and a degree of power that we are able to deploy to your aid. [overlapping] That we—
August Righteousness: [overlapping] I want command.
[pause]
Tomorrow Mourning: Done.
August Righteousness: Done.
Ali: [chuckles]
Jack: Uh… Let me see. Okay.
Austin: I mean, do we zoom out at this point?
Jack: God! Because the thing that I think is going to happen is… the blockade is going to happen quickly but the deployment of ground forces is a little more slow. Which means other things start to get moved into… get to get put into motion in terms of people going to ground. We already talked about Future going to ground, effectively. People beginning to try to escape… Or people digging in to fight harder.
I don't know who did what yet. I know Art, you have a scene coming up. I don't know where that scene will end up being. We'll talk about that, I think, momentarily. Or in a little bit. But I want to leave some of that open. But I do think it's possible that… Also! I suspect that Mustard Red is going to draw things out in proceduralism [chuckles] a little bit. When it comes down to…
Sylvi: [overlapping] What? She would neveeerr…!
Austin: [overlapping] Down to putting forces on the ground. You know?
Keith: [overlapping] Her and what army?
Austin: [overlapping] Which is part of why we only get Lucia… Yeah. Well! Her and the army of “we've all agreed that this is…”
Ali: W-w-well…!
Austin: Uh-huh.
[Keith & Sylvie laugh]
Ali: I… [laughs]
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, you want her… Wait a second!
Keith: [overlapping] [chuckling] Are you sure? Are you sure you don’t want to play Mustard Red?
Ali: [overlapping] [chuckles] Was that Mustard Red's music? But…
Sylvi: [giggles]
Ali: So there's two things happening here. Which is that…
Austin: Uh-huh!
Ali: Arbitrage is less interested in Palisade and therefore not interested in the… like, battle anymore. Right?
Austin: [overlapping] I… Totally.
Ali: [overlapping] So, like, would not feel the need to sway those things?
Austin: My question is what were the final instructions Arbitrage gave to Mustard.
Ali: Oh, sure! But it's always been, like, more subtle than that anyway. Right?
Austin: Yea-yea-yeah.
Ali: And, like, her… She was…
Austin: So is she just back to being “go with the flow” mode?
Ali: Her first… Her impulse in Orbital was this sort of, like, hyper security…
Austin: Yeah. True. True.
Ali: … the way that you solve things is knowing as much as you can about people, [overlapping] so you can, like…
Austin: [overlapping] [chuckling] Is it more security cameras?
Ali: Right.
Jack: [laughs]
Ali: Yeah! No. She's… She's Ring-camera-pilled.
Austin: Yeah. Uh-huh.
Ali: So, like, I think the thing of, like, I don't know that she would be the axis this turns on ‘cause she would not… unless it was, like, an Arbitrage: “Hey, let the Bilats pass.” Like…
Austin: No. Ri-ri-right.
Ali: [overlapping] Or… Which… Which it isn’t.
Austin: [overlapping]  But it isn't! We…
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] It seems, like, we're saying it's done. Yeah. Yeah.
Ali: I don't know that she would get herself involved in this way. Especially when she is in a point of…
Austin: Vulnerability, in some ways, right?
Ali: Sure. Yeah. Yea-yea-yeah. Unsuredness I think is the word that I was looking for.
Austin: Yeah…
Ali: Like, she doesn't… Without those markers she would not stick her neck out like that by all means.
Austin: Right. Right.
Ali: And then would also be like: “Yeah, you have to keep the people safe!”
Austin: [chuckles] Uh-huh!
Ali: [chuckles] ‘Cause, like, that's just who she is. [laughs]
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: And I think that… You know. If she could secure that with August Righteousness… August Righteousness and Mourning would be pushing for speed. Not haste! But… [overlapping] But, you know.
Austin: [overlapping] Yes. Yeah. Well, it…
Ali: [overlapping] Right.
Austin: [overlapping] My instinct is…
Jack: [overlapping] This is a situation of emergency.
Austin: Yeah. My instinct is it still is not unanimous. Right? I suspect that…
Jack: The Pirates…!
Austin: The Pirates, specifically, are like: “No, we don't want the military here! We don't want the Qui Err military here!” Violet Cove doesn't show up. [chuckles] 
Jack: Which rings alarm bells. You know…
Austin: Right!
Jack: That is… I don't think people see that happen and go: [quizzically] “oh, huh!”
Austin: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Like, St Decario Dicario does not show up… the way that he is supposed to. Um… Rose River is probably… there's probably a big internal debate at [chuckles] in Rose River about this? You know? Veronique and Fealty have to have a big internal discussion about whether it's good to invite The Mirage in here — I don't know!
Jack: The transformative power of art or whether nature or humans can… [chuckles]
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. But… Which is say, it doesn't just come down to Mustard Red. But you're… But also I take your point, Ali.
Ali: [overlapping] Uhum.
Austin: [overlapping] That it moves faster than it would if this was outside of… If Arbitrage was still whispering in the ear of Mustard Red.
Ali: Right.
Austin: Which brings us to the funniest possible outcome of all of the Mustard Red shit — which is that, like, she just quietly goes back to being a kind-of-okay bureaucrat?
Ali: [laughs] Well, that was the second thing that I was going to say! In just, like… In terms of, like, office politics what do you do when… the boss who liked you the most…
Austin: Uh-huh…!
Ali: … gets a promotion? Or, you know, changes jobs or whatever? You try to make the…
Austin: God…
Ali: … the guy who just got a promotion, August Righteousness, rely on you.
Austin: [chuckles] Unbelievable!
Jack: This is… This is Dr Faustus, except halfway through the devil got bored and went elsewhere.
Austin: [chuckles] 
Jack: And then Dr Faustus went: “Well, guess I'm back to being a sort of a…”
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: “... regular academic…”
Austin: Yeah!
Jack: “... and researcher!”
[pause]
Austin: [overlapping] “Now who are these..?”
Jack: [overlapping] “That bit where I had my own devil familiar?”
Austin: Yeah! Exactly! “Now who are these revolutionaries? Do they need a doctor? Are they…?”
Jack: [laughs]
Austin: [sighs]
Jack: Um… The next thing that she proposes is an immediate call for surrender from Exenchester March; Lucia Whitestar; and The Divine Crusade and Gentian. Without an expectation that it will happen.
Austin: Right.
Jack: [overlapping] But there needs to be a call for surrender.
Austin: [overlapping] You’ve to go through the steps. Right.
Jack: And if the… If surrender doesn't come, she proposes Mirage-backed efforts to capture Exenchester March; [chuckles] Lucia Whitestar; and the Divine Gentian as war criminals.
Austin: And so now I think we do have to ask this question — as the people who've been playing those characters —, Art as Gensin. Not Gensin. Gentian. Genshin Impact. Gentian Impact. Um…
Dre: Uhum.
Austin: You as Lucia…
Art: [overlapping] We never really got a lot of Gentian Impact, frankly.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. We didn't. It didn't happen, somehow. Weird.
Ali: [chuckles]
Keith: [overlapping] Good.
Austin: [overlapping] And me as Exenchester March. How do they respond to this? [chuckles] This call for…
Jack: I can do the first one! Uh, Lucia Whitestar does not surrender.
Austin: Okay.
Jack: Lander 1 has gone to ground. She knows that if Lander 1, or if any of her… She tried it, actually. Lander 8 tried to take off and just got obliterated by…
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: … Cause and Mirage troops.
Austin: Uhum.
Jack: Lander 1 has dug in. It crashed in, like, a canyon in a forest. It is, like, wedged securely in the canyon.
Austin: Uhum.
Jack: And she is not surrendering.
Austin: Exenchester March agrees to go under house arrest in City City.
Jack: Ehh…
Austin: Under armed protection!
Jack: I think that…
Austin: Pending trial!
Jack: [overlapping] I…
Austin: [overlapping] From some sort of commission.
Keith: Armed protection…?
Austin: From them! From the Twilight Mirage people.
Keith: Okay.
Jack: I think that Mourning rejects this proposal. Does August Righteousness…?
Austin: Oh, yeah, of course rejects that.
Jack: Yeah. Okay. So that's no surrender? [half-chuckling] Exenchester March is…
Austin: Well, no-no-no! Exenchester March is like: “Well, then let's negotiate terms!”
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: “What are you prepared to offer me?”
Jack: [chuckles] I don't think we're playing games with Exenchester March in this way!
Austin: We are. ‘Cause you'll lose people if you try to attack. “What do you want for me to come in?”
[pause]
Jack: [sighs]
Austin: “Or what can you guarantee me?”
[pause]
Austin: He's, like…
Austin (as Exenchester March): I'm a businessman. I'm happy to negotiate. But I won't come in unless you can guarantee me fair treatment and housing while the trial goes on.
Jack: No! He… [laughs] He's a war criminal! He… What was the… in the chat the other day…? In the production chat Ally described the last episode of Palisade as 15 minutes of the most fucked up thing you've ever heard…
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: [half-chuckling] … and then the Twilight Mirage arrives?
Austin: Yeah. Yea-yea-yeah.
Jack: Mourning is not… You know: “you are going to be captured as a common criminal.” I don't think that she says this but, like, the operation to capture Exenchester March… We're not negotiating terms with this guy!
Austin: Alright.
Art: Wow, I just heard that they won't… [overlapping] promise fair trial to common criminals.
Austin: [overlapping] That’s what I heard, too!
Dre: [overlapping] That’s what I’ve heard. Yea-yea-yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. Wow! The Twilight Mirage…
Art: [overlapping] If you're a common criminal you won’t get a fair trial.
Austin: [overlapping] You know who's gonna love to talk about this? It’s Gur Sevraq.
Jack: We're going to arbitrate this in the courts.
Art: [overlapping] They won't even house you.
Austin: [overlapping] They won’t even house you.
Art: They'll… put you on the street while they give you an unfair trial.
Jack: [chuckles]
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: “It just goes to show you you can't…”
Art: That's… [overlapping] That's fucked up, IMO!
Austin: [overlapping] “... you can’t trust when they say turn yourself in, ‘cause… they actually said no. He tried to turn himself in.”
Art: Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Uhum.
Art: [overlapping] You'll be living on the streets in front of the courthouse.
Jack: Okay!
Art: [overlapping] Fucked up!
Austin: [overlapping] These are the games that The Divine Principality is prepared to play.
Jack: Yeah. The games that the Twilight Mirage and The Cause are prepared to play will be played out in Questlandia. [chuckles]
Austin: [chuckles] Uh-huh!
Jack: It is worth saying that the military power… The scales have changed.
Austin: Uhum!
Jack: 36 Pillars versus 4.
Austin: No, no, no! I get it! I just also know the history of actual war criminals.
Jack: Oh, yeah!
Austin: And.. the things that they managed to get for themselves. Right?
Dre: Hmm.
Austin: And… especially when those war criminals are, like, not actually war criminals. They're just capitalists who were part of…
Jack: [overlapping] One of the things that war criminals…
Austin: [overlapping] … an expansionary, you know…
Jack: [overlapping] You know…
Austin: [overlapping] … inside of…
Art: [overlapping] You know. Incidental war criminals.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
Jack: Although! I want to be explicit: one of the things that war criminals have also historically gotten for themselves is special treatment; is house arrest, in the city.
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: You know? If the… This is exactly how the playbook works so I'm not saying this is a surprise — but had I agreed to that [overlapping] the playbook would have been…
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, no!
Jack: “Oh, you're giving them special treatment in the house arrest!”
Austin: Yes, absolutely. [half-chuckling] A hundred percent.
Art: I heard you can't even guarantee them a fair trial.
Austin: [half-chuckling] My point is really simply to illustrate the difficulty of what goes next if you're going to start playing by the rules that the civil war criminal is going to put at your feet. Right? Um. Not… Just to be super clear! [half-chuckling] This is not Austin being like: “Well, why are you treating this war criminal so poorly?” [chuckles] It's Exenchester March trying to make a play. [overlapping] And being stifled by it.
Jack: [overlapping] Oh, right! But the rules that I am putting at his feet is…
Austin: [overlapping]  Yep. Yeah.
Jack: [overlapping] … “you do not get to dictate the terms after what you have done to the people of this planet.”
Austin: Yeah. But… What it also means is now we know that Exenchester March is still on the board in this way.
Jack: As is Lucia Whitestar. As is Gentian. Because The Principality says…
Austin: Sorry, we didn't get that answer from Art, necessarily.
Jack: Oh, yeah. I don't know.
Art: Oh, yeah! But no. There's not going to be a surrender from Crusade.
Austin: Uhum.
Art: No. That's not… We'll… rain broken glass from the skies before…
Jack: [laughs]
Exenchester March: Now see, I'm not saying all that! I… I could work with you! I'd happily even testify. Under the right conditions.
Ali: [chuckles]
Exenchester March: There are things I know that no one knows. [overlapping] But it seems you don’t wanna hear them!
Jack: [overlapping] Who is he saying these to? This is, like, a…
Austin: [overlapping] Whatever… Whoever your reach-out was!
Jack: Yeah. Yeah. And the reach-out comes out and says it to Righteousness and Mourning and The Cause. And Righteousness and Mourning and The Cause go: “Yeah. Listen to him.”
[pause] 
Jack: Ehhh…! Okay. So we launch operations… joint operations immediately. And that is… that is not something to be played out now, but Mirage units are going to come. I've got a sense of what they are. Um. The next thing is an establishment of a court of justice in neutral ground. And a Doctrine for the prisoners of war. That is to say, conditions under which prisoners of war will be treated and things that they can expect. That is to be fed. To be… kept in sanitary conditions. Not to be, you know, overcrowded. Etc. This is… This is the zoom in on the conversation with August Righteousness is like.
Austin: [overlapping] Right, right, right. Yup.
Jack: [overlapping] “This is what we need to lay out immediately.”
Art: Wow, still no fair trials, though!
Austin: [chuckles]
Art: It's really shocking.
Jack: [overlapping] That is…
Keith: [overlapping] What do they call kangaroos on Palisade?
Jack: Yeah. They… [chuckles]
Art: Yeah.
Jack: [chuckling] They do have a right to a fair trial!
Austin: This is a real duck court here.
Keith: [laughs]
Jack: Um…
Austin: Does anybody… Who… Are there any NPCs that we know who turn themselves in at this point?
[00:30:02]
Jack: Occam Olio doesn't turn themself in, unless we want… What is the funnier Occam Olio approach here? It's no surrender, right? Occam Olio has always rolled the most complicated dice [overlapping] and come out tremendously.
Austin: [overlapping] No. Yeah. Occam is explicitly on the Exenchester March bodyguard team now.
Ali: Uhum.
Austin: Right? It's like: “Oh, you're invincible. You have The Plot behind you. I will… I am never going to die [overlapping] because you’re my personal bodyguard.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Ali: [gasps]
Keith: I do have…
Ali: I have to do Occam Olio!
Jack: [overlapping] Ohhh! Brnine…!
Austin: [overlapping] Are you Mustard Red?
Jack: No, Brnine!
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Brnine! Brnine has… Yes! Yes. [overlapping] Yes.
Jack: [overlapping] Indestructible Brnine versus indestructible Occam Olio.
Austin: Yes.
Ali: [chuckles]
Jack: [overlapping] Who will win?
Austin: [overlapping] This is one of the things I thought was going to happen last session! And it didn't! So…
Ali: Yeah… Well…
Austin: So…
Ali: Well…
Keith: I do have something about… I do have some, like, questions about the… new situation on the ground because of the Palisade stuff. So, because of the Twilight Mirage… Sorry, because of Twilight Mage stuff. Because of the Twilight Mirage and its complications all of the… [searching for the term] Oh my god! The Authority Factions.
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: They're… stuck here.
Austin: Yeah!
Keith: [overlapping] They're, like, stuck here.
Jack: [overlapping] Ehh… No. They have some choices.
Austin: [overlapping] No. Well! Stuck is… Yes. That's exactly right. They have some choices.
Keith: [overlapping] Stuck with a big asterisk of like: “Okay, you can spend years leaving.”
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: Or whatever.
Jack: [overlapping] Yes.
Austin: [overlapping] But for a Divine what's what's a decade in the Mirage? Leaving the Mirage?
Keith: [overlapping] Sure! Sure.
Jack: [overlapping] They can also… flee into the Mirage. That has worked well for Future. But the blockade is beginning to be established.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Right? And I think Future only gets away because it's on a different Mirage ship.
Jack: Yep.
Keith: But I'm… But I'm talking about people. Because the… Like, you know. You can run it as far up the organization as you want. And until you hit Divines [overlapping] we’re talking about people.
Austin: [overlapping] You're just talking about a random person who is part of… If you're talking about Occam Olio, or if you're talking about…
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: … You know, one of these other major… You know, minor characters who's part of the The Authority who wants to get away…
Keith: [overlapping] And…
Austin: [overlapping] You're asking: “Is that possible?”
Keith: Well, I think… Yeah. And the other thing is… Wanting to consider, you know, what would I think if I'm like: “Okay, I'm part of The Authority. I work for Kesh.”
Austin: Uhum!
Keith: “I have realized that, you know… I'm in my early 30s — if I ever want to see Kesh again I'm going to be on a ship until I'm 40 years old.”
Austin: Uhum!
Keith: “Or! I live here now.”
Austin: Right.
Keith: “What the fuck does Kesh mean to me? I have…” 
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. You know who…
Keith: [overlapping] “I have to…”
Austin: You know who instantly, on this, turns themselves in — is the Fabriel Duchy leadership. [overlapping] Right?
Jack: [overlapping] Oh, yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] Sure.
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: Easy.
Keith: [overlapping] They live here.
Jack: [overlapping] That's a particular delight to August Righteousness.
Austin: Yeah. Yeah, of course. Absolutely. They feel lost. They feel like they've been… They had already kind of turned on Kesh when the…
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] … the Stellar Combustor stuff happened with the… What was her name? Why am I blanking on this? The…
Jack: Elcessor. [overlapping] Stargrave.
Austin: [overlapping] Stargrave. Yeah. Yeah.
Keith: So I'm just… I'm just thinking about, like, what do the thousands and thousands of people…
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah…
Keith: [overlapping] … who make up this army feel…
Austin: [overlapping] God…!
Keith: [overlapping] … when they're like: “Okay, you've got one side fighting for Palisade to be Palisade. And you've got the other side fighting for it to be part of something that doesn't exist as far as my lifespan is concerned.”
Jack: That is to say, The Principality.
Keith: That is to say, The Principality.
Austin: Forget about… Forget about the soldiers! You remember who else was here?
Jack: Fucking millions of settlers! [chuckles]
Austin: Well. And. Yeah. Millions of settlers.
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: And then also tourists!
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. Sorry! You live here now.
Austin: [overlapping] who are coming to see Gur Sevraq talk to the other two religious figures!
Keith: [laughs] I hope… [overlapping] I hope that you brought your spade, ‘cause you're digging here.
Austin: [overlapping] That old lady. What was that old lady’s name? [laughs] Yeah. Exactly! What was that old lady that Figure and Eclectic met?
Jack: Oh. Oh…
Dre: Oh, yeah!
Jack: [overlapping] The well-meaning and deeply irritating old lady?
Keith: [overlapping] Oh yeah. I don’t remember. But yeah.
Dre: She lives there now.
Ali: She…
Austin: She lives here now! She just lives here now.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: And maybe is a criminal! [chuckles]
Keith: And maybe is a criminal.
Austin: [chuckles]
Keith: Anyway! You know, I'm just… I'm just throwing it out there that I would certainly be having a crisis of confidence in my allegiance to The Divine Principality…
Austin: [giggles] Uhum.
Keith: … who's trying to take a planet that they can't access reasonably anymore.
Austin: Correct. Yeah, we should note a thing that's not inside of the Twilight Mirage — is the big Portculis Gate. The thing that connects it to the rest of the Galaxy. There were not bombs placed around that — Twilight Mirage bombs placed around that — because that explicitly would have given the Principality a back door into the Twilight Mirage. And, I think, the Cult of Devotion is… was doing some goofy stuff, [overlapping] but it actually wasn't that.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: At this point. It was not “we're trying to… give The Principality a direct backdoor here.” There's something else going on there, TBD. I mean, it's not even TBD! We know that their big picture goal was: “turn the whole galaxy into the Twilight Mirage.” Right? [overlapping] They've laid that out…
Jack: [overlapping] And then use it to beat The Pact.
Austin: Yeah. Exactly. Sort of. Kind of… Ehhh… It's a little messier than that — but that's because the Devotion situation is messy.
[pause]
Jack: [overlapping] Oh, right! Yes.
Austin: [overlapping] Use their blood to… question mark.
Austin: Right. The thing that happens with Devotion is that Devotion gets corrupted and turned towards Principality ends by The Curtain, many generations ago… and there's some sort of false Devotion in place. But that Devotion’s goals seem to have drifted away from simply being pro-Principality and into being… pro-itself. You know? Um. Strangely… aligned with the Principality but also aligned with this… Mirage Supremacy that the whole galaxy should be part of this thing. You know?
Jack: Right. Exactly the kind of stuff that speaks to… 3T.
Austin: That's right. Yeah.
Jack: Umm…!
Austin: Eh, but so to answer your question “and if someone wanted to try to escape”: they might be able to try to find a way. And I when I say “they”, I mean, like, the big picture super-characters here. Not only Crusade, but, you know… Does Exenchester March immediately send out spies to try to find one of those old Advent Catapults that he's heard so much about — that can more quickly bring stuff out of the Mirage to the rest of space?
Keith: Right.
Austin: Yes. Right? Can he get to one of those? Different question.
Keith: ‘Cause fundamentally… the decision to, like: “no, I want to stay here and still fight that war”, it takes a very specific kind of nut job… [chuckles]
Jack: [chuckles]
Keith: … to wind up there, I think.
Austin: I think, you can get there quicker in some ways if you're, like, deeply zealous about something.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Ali: [overlapping] Or if your leaders are still invested. Right?
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: Which is sort of what it feels like is happening?
Austin: Yeah. Yeah! I mean, I guess that's the question! Like — and this maybe is a question that we'll have to put into play at in Questlandia — is how long does the morale of the Bilats remaining stay. Because once it's broken…
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] … who knows what happens there. You know?
Jack: Yeah.
Keith: Um and maybe not every… you know, foot soldier is gaming out [chuckles] how the Twilight Mirage works.
Austin: No. Right.
Keith: You know…
Austin: Totally.
Jack: And it's worth saying that we are… you know. We've said it in the past we're not making Twilight Mirage 2 here. I am really only interested in the development of, like, quote-unquote “Twilight Mirage law” as it is applicable to this situation.
Ali: Uhum.
Jack: And… You know. We need to know, on some, level: “what's happening on Gift-3?” But we are not out here being like… This is PALISADE. Right? This is a season about Palisade.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Jack: [overlapping] However, it would be naive and foolhardy to say that [half-chuckling] detonating the Twilight Mirage bombs doesn't bring in… you know, the Twilight Mirage.
Keith: Although, structurally doing a season called Twilight Mirage 2 as the finale to PALISADE would be out of this world.
Ali: [chuckles contemptuously]
Austin: It’d be very funny.
Jack: God.
Ali: [chuckles] 
Austin: It’d be very funny.
Jack: I so nearly called the track “The Twilight Mirage”.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Ah, you should’ve!
Jack: [overlapping] But I'm not going to make someone's uh Apple music library… [chuckles]
Dre: [laughs]
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. That’s fair. That’s fair.
Jack: [overlapping] … just have two… two tracks of the same name.
Austin: That's fair.
Jack: Um. I think the… last sort of position that Mourning is — in terms of, like, we need to start establishing this quickly — is the establishment of a joint tribunal of Palisade, Millennium Break, and Twilight Mirage members. She is prepared to authorize the deployment of somebody called Gray Equity Minaire [sp]. The Equities are… at the time of Twilight Mirage were members of something called the Golden Clause.
Austin: Yeah. The Golden Clause! That’s what I was laughing about. I was like: “Oh, damn! I haven't heard that name in a minute!”
Jack: In a minute! We last met very briefly a character called Red Equity Janus who was a kind of legal researcher in Twilight Mirage.
Austin: This was Fourteen Fifteen’s legal coach during the downtime [overlapping] or during the “This Year of Ours” right?
Jack: [overlapping] Of like: “I want to become a public defender.”
Austin: Right. Yeah!
Jack: And…
Austin: Wild season!
[Jack & Ali laugh]
Jack: God! That was the one where Fourteen Fifteen rode a bird!
Austin: Yeah. [overlapping] That happened.
Ali: [overlapping] Wait, became a lawyer and rode a bird?
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah, a chocobo.
Jack: [overlapping] It's Twilight Mirage, Ali.
Austin: Right?
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: Yea-yea-yeah.
Dre: Damn. [overlapping] This new Final Fantasy 7 game’s crazy!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Phoenix Wright has done that, like, it’s whatever.
Austin: [overlapping] Uhum.
Jack: Same episode becomes a lawyer and rides a bird. [overlapping] I think rides a bird to become a lawyer.
Keith: [overlapping] Could be part of… Right. It could be part of becoming a lawyer in the Twilight Mirage.
Austin: [chuckles]
Jack: But what they have is they have… somebody called Grey Equity Minaire, who is a Qui Err woman, who has been… She's essentially a… like, a criminal judge of war crimes. Of… You know, what happens when you have someone who has committed a genocide on a planet? What is the sort of legal jurisdiction that you can move within? And Mourning is offering her deployment to the planet not as “a she runs the show”...
Austin: Uhum.
Jack: … but in terms of, like, the Mirage's perspective on… Its own particular wing of justice can be deployed to Palisade.
Austin: Yeah!
Jack: But that's not condition… Or rather… the rest of her support is not conditional on that.
Austin: I think all this goes forward.
Jack: Uh…
Austin: The stage is set a little bit here.
Jack: Yeah. Um… And then I think… God! What does Mourning spend the rest of her day doing? She has troops… You know, she has had troops that are on this planet before, who are currently engaged in skirmishes with whatever — so in the same way Righteousness is like: “I can't send you 16”, she is like: [chuckles] “I can't send you 12”.
Austin: Uhum.
Jack: “I need to get a jumpship as quickly as possible to this island.”
Austin: [chuckling] But because this is Twilight Mirage now, when she says “I can't send you 12”, she means “I can't send you the person named Twelve, they're busy right now.”
Keith: [laughs]
Jack: Oh, Twelve is… Yeah. Twelve is actually… twelve like, individual sort of weird computer units…
Austin: [overlapping] Right. Uh-huh!
Jack: [overlapping] … that are running themselves together as an individual person.
Austin: Right. Right. [laughs]
Jack: God! They're an entire… A small gang, literally.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Yes.
Keith: But there's thirteen of them.
Jack: Yes, because someone else joined and…
Austin: [chuckles]
Keith: [laughs]
Austin: Yeah. Well, they wanted to join Twelve, they didn't want to join Thirteen. Yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] Right.
Jack: [overlapping] No, no. It's no fun if it's like that.
Austin: Uhum.
Jack: Yeah…!
Keith: Nickname: Baker's Dozen.
Austin: [chuckles] 
Jack: Yeah. What does the Twilight Mirage do — horrible question. And the answer is: the Twilight Mirage is full of millions of people with different ideas. And…
Austin: So, Jack, are you playing Mourning for Questlandia?
Jack: I don't know.
Austin: [overlapping] Okay.
Jack: [overlapping] I might be playing… I think I might be playing someone on Palisade. I think I might be playing Righteousness.
Austin: Oh, Mourning is not staying on Palisade?
Jack: Oh, no! Someone from the Palisade…
Austin: Interesting.
Jack: A Palisade… citizen. As it were.
Austin: Gotcha. Like Righteousness. Like you said. [overlapping] Potentially. Cool!
Jack: [overlapping] Like Righteousness. Not, like, Kalar… I don't know. But I do think it is worth saying into a microphone that while there are elements of the Mirage that are like… “You know, it's important to let Future preach.” You know? This is a…
Austin: Uhum.
Jack: The woman that got deployed to the Twilight Mirage at the beginning of this season is not here to be like: “we have to be kind to our enemies.”
Austin: Right, right, right.
Jack: You know?
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: Um… She is here saying: “we need to seek retribution”. And that is going to be complex. But uh she is not prepared to be out here being like: “Ehhh, let's hem and haw about whether or not they deserve to be under house arrest.”
Austin: Uhum. You know, a strong message gets sent when someone says: “Can you let me stay in house arrest”, and you say no. [overlapping] That's… That is…
Jack: [overlapping] You are going to be captured as a…
Austin: Yep.
Jack: … a soldier.
Austin: Yep. Alright. That's a scene.
Dre’s scene [0:43:45]
Austin: Dre, do you want to introduce your new character?
Dre: Yeah. Sure. Um… Gosh! What is the equivalent of a semi-truck in the Twilight Mirage?
Jack: Now…
Sylvi: Ohhh…!
Jack: This is a good question! It might be a semi-truck.
Ali: [giggles]
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] That's fair.
Austin: But it could also be, like, a giant sneaker. [chuckles]
Jack: [laughs]
Dre: Sure…
Austin: [overlapping] We've seen this. We know this.
Jack: [overlapping] It could be…
Austin: But actually, we have the actual answer to this. And it is just giant space semi-trucks because that's what Grand Magnificent worked on. For that year.
Art: Yeah.
Jack: Well, a long time ago.
Austin: That's true.
Dre: Oh, that works though! Uh… Hey, what did… what did the semi-trucks that Grand Magnificent worked on for that year look like?
Austin: They look, like, semi-trucks in space if I remember correctly. Right?
Art: Yeah. I think that's right. Yeah.
Ali: [chuckles]
Art: We went very… [overlapping] literal all on that.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. And then, as a reminder, during Orbital we talked about how they, like, over time…
Jack: [overlapping] Oh, god!
Austin: [overlapping] … some of them became part of the body of the Brink. Where they were like…
Jack: [overlapping] Orbital was wonderful! There was, like, a lot of weird internal trade discussion going on in Orbital… [chuckles]
Austin: If you haven't listened… If you skipped the Road to PALISADE because you wanted to get into the meat of PALISADE proper…
Jack: [overlapping] Fair enough!
Austin: [overlapping] You can only… Fair enough! But if you can only listen…
Keith: [overlapping] [skeptically] Hmmm…!
[00:45:01]
Austin: I would think that the whole mini-season was great. And it's part of… It really is part of this season and some of our best work is there. I really believe that. But also Orbital was maybe one of my favorite things we've done [overlapping] in one of the Roads.
Keith: [overlapping] I mean, what's the point of the show if not to listen to it?
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: [overlapping] Shit.
Austin: [overlapping] I agree.
Keith: You know what I mean?
Sylvi: So true!
Dre: [overlapping] Shit.
Austin: [overlapping] So true. So true.
Keith: Like, the episode… Like, PALISADE — it's all just episodes! Just listen to it in order.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Jack: [overlapping] Also, if you have been put off by the length of Twilight Mirage and have often thought: “What the hell is going on in that place?” I cannot think of, like… The Orbital game is, like, you have drunk — you know — 7/8s of your cup of coffee and what is at the bottom [chuckles] is extremely strong and extremely weird. And that is the Orbital game.
Austin: Right. And it's the Twilight Mirage down there. [overlapping] At the bottom of the coffee.
Jack: [overlapping] Yes.
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: [laughs] 
Austin: And also… you've basically already listened to something as long as a Twilight Mirage if you listen to the Road to PALISADE and PALISADE.
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: After this is over you can just go listen to Twilight Mirage. It's worth it.
Art: [overlapping] I don't think that's a good way to make people think about that. Not sure about that one.
Dre: [overlapping] No! ‘Cause I think some people… some people get, like… Oh, what's the word I'm looking for?
Keith: [overlapping] Psyched out!
Dre: [overlapping] They, like, freak themselves out… They get psyched out!
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] That's the perfect word. Right? They're like: “Oh, that's so much!” But you don't realize that you've just been doing that already. Right?
Austin: Yeah. This is episode 63 or 64 of Road to PALISADE plus PALISADE. And Twilight Mirage only has 67 episodes.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] You're basically… You know?
Keith: I just think people put too much emphasis on getting caught up.
Austin: Yeah. [overlapping] People… People have reasons.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] Listen to it… Listen to the episodes and be behind.
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: Yeah. People want to be up to date, people want to listen along! It's fun.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] But I get it. But I'm with you. I also think…
Keith: There's always going to be people who want to talk about Twilight Mirage with you. It's going to be fine.
Dre: [overlapping] That’s true.
Jack: [overlapping] Tell me about the semi-truck.
Dre: Yeah! Okay.
Sylvi: Yeah. Please.
Dre: So a semi-truck pulls up to the… where the Blue Channel is. Does the Blue Channel just, like, landed somewhere?
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah, where is the Blue Channel?
Dre: [overlapping] Or is, like, the Blue Channel flying around?
Austin: Is it near the rest of, like, Cause folks at this point?
Ali: Um…
Austin: [overlapping] I’m gonna move us back to Palisade map.
Ali: [overlapping] I bet. We definitely didn't stay near the Lone Marble stuff. Just because that…
Austin: [chuckles] Yeah!
Ali: … would be a fucking nightmare.
Austin: Fair enough! And I do think… They're probably… Yeah. I would imagine that Clause leadership would… Oh, they're probably in the Bontive Valley? Question mark?
Austin: Uhum. Uhum.
Ali: ‘Cause we just sort of liberated that.
Austin: Yeah, that makes sense to me.
Ali: And then, you know, if you can't deliver food people should… [chuckles] come close to where the food is!
Austin: Uhum.
Ali: Um…
Austin: And, like, again the kind of medical help that…
Ali: Uhum. Uhum.
Austin: … that people need right now. Kind of getting everybody together makes sense.
Ali: Uhum.
Dre: Hm.
Austin: So. Dre?
Dre: So, yeah. This big… I want to say the semi-truck flies, but when it lands, the wheels pop out.
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: And emblazoned on the side in a very fancy script uh is the name of a group, and that group is called… The Cascabel-Gardener Catering Cooperative.
Jack: [giggles]
Austin: Incredible.
Sylvi: [giggles]
Austin: Like I said there's good sandwiches out here, Brnine!
Dre: Uhum. Uhum. And out of the truck from, like, the — what do you call it, the cab? The driver's cab? 
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: — steps a young man in his early 20s. He has light brown skin. And he kind of shouts out, like:
Levitation: Hey, I need somebody to sign for this?
Austin: Who's going out to sign for this truck or whatever's in it?
Keith: I'll sign for a truck.
Austin: Eclectic cops out… comes out.
Eclectic Opposition: Hey. What's… What's going on?
Ali: Oh. Brnine immediately follows Eclectic. After…
Dre: [laughs]
Austin: Uh-huh.
Ali: … after some of the words and phrases that Eclectic has said about the Blue Channel.
Austin: Whoa! Okay!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Damn.
Keith: [overlapping] I think I've been nothing but helpful.
Austin: [overlapping] PVP mode activated.
Ali: [overlapping] I'm pretty sure that you said you didn't care about it! Um… and there's tape on that.
Dre: [overlapping] That is true!
Ali: [laughs]
Janine: [overlapping] Do…
Dre: [overlapping] And then you weren't part of the conversation where Figure Eclectic… Yeah. Yeah.
Ali: [overlapping] I wasn’t at the heart-to-heart.
Janine: [overlapping] Do you think…
Keith: [overlapping] That’s a misunderstanding.
Ali: [laughs]
Janine: Do you think he gonna, like, walk up and be like: “Hey, I'll sign for the sandwiches. P.S. this place stinks and I hate it here. Thanks.”
Austin: [chuckles]
Janine: Like, what do you think is going to happen here exactly?
Ali: [overlapping] Well, just…
Dre: [overlapping] “You've got the look that you want to join this group and you really shouldn't, bro!”
Ali: [chuckles]
Janine: [overlapping] Eh…
Austin: [overlapping] “Get out of here! Save yourself!”
Keith: I think Eclectic was delivering a much needed dose of de-Blue-Channel-centricism…
Ali: [chuckles]
Keith: … to the Blue Channel… operants! To borrow a phrase.
Janine: [overlapping] No, you can’t…
Austin: [overlapping] To borrow a phrase from Thisbe. To steal… [chuckles]
Janine: [agitated] No-no-no-no! That's what an operant is! [overlapping] Get out of here!
Austin: [overlapping] It’s not how it works!
Janine: Space him.
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: [overlapping] An operant is anyone who operates!
Sylvi: [overlapping] [mock-shouting] Get the fuck out of here!
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvi: This fucking guy!
Austin: [tired] Ohhh… [laughs] Um… What's Asepsis think of… this new person who's arrived? You're not from here. Right?
Dre: No, I'm from the Twilight Mirage.
Austin: Yeah. So, like, I think that… Wait, did you replace your scouter yet? Brnine?
Ali: Owie… I don't know that I've had… [overlapping] I don't know that we've had a turnaround.
Austin: [overlapping] You didn’t have the time!
Ali: [overlapping] I don't know that that's my priority right now.
Austin: [overlapping] Is there… Are there sepsis drones, like, following you around? Does it just communicate to you through…
Ali: [overlapping] I still have the backpack one.
Austin: Okay, so the backpack one is, like…
Ali: The backpack one is now a belt one.
Austin: [chuckles] You just wear one on your belt?
Ali: [chuckles]
Keith: Like a Pokéball?
Ali: [chuckling] Yeah!
Austin: Like a little Pokéball? [overlapping] It’s like…
Keith: [overlapping] It's not the… It's not the Mario Sunshine backpack anymore, it’s the…
Ali: I suddenly wanted to give, like, Brnine the, like, dyke carbiner energy. [overlapping] Because that’s…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah!
Janine: Carabiner?
Ali: Yeah. Yeah.
Janine: Okay.
Ali: Sorry. [chuckles]
Keith: Um…
Austin: Well, it's chittering at this new arrival who it doesn't know and doesn't smell right, and comes from a different place.
Keith: I’ll pull out something, too! I'm also scanning them. I'm scanning the truck. The back of the truck.
Art: [overlapping] With that truck scanner.
Dre: [overlapping] Uhum.
Keith: I got… I can scan.
Austin: Oh, yeah. You're a detective. You got a truck scanner for sure.
Keith: Yeah. Yeah.
Levitation: I have a manifest in the cab. I can just get it. [overlapping] If you wanna know what’s in there.
Eclectic Opposition: [overlapping] You can fake manifests.
Kalvin Brnine: [overlapping] Uh…
Eclectic Opposition: [overlapping] A manifest is worth the paper it's printed on.
Levitation: Alright! Well… I mean, we already got… we already got paid! This deal for distributing food was already done so, like, if you don't want it I can just go.
Eclectic Opposition: Did you order food?
Kalvin Brnine: Um. Hi your name is…?
Levitation: Oh. Uh… Levitation.
Kalvin Brnine: Chill. Hi. Hey.
Levitation: Hey.
Kalvin Brnine: Um…
Eclectic Opposition: [whispering] Chill?
Ali: [chuckles]
Levitation: Are you… Are you the… Are you, uh, “Brinninny”?
[Keith & Sylvi laugh]
Kalvin Brnine: That's me.
Levitation: Okay. Okay. [overlapping] Yea-yea-yeah.
Kalvin Brnine: [overlapping] It's Brnine. It's Brnine. The “n” is silent. Yeah.
Levitation: [overlapping] Oh! Shit. I’m sorry. I'm sorry. Wait…
Kalvin Brnine: No, it's fine! No-no-no.
Levitation: Hold on.
Kalvin Brnine: The first one.
Janine: So it’s Brie.[1]
Levitation: [overlapping] Oh. Okay. Okay, okay.
Janine: [overlapping] If the Ns are silent.
Austin: [overlapping] Brie.[2]
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] Like, the cheese?
Kalvin Brnine: [overlapping] Just the one.
Janine: [giggles]
Levitation: Yeah. Um… I guess… I don't know your whole… I don't know your structure here, but I guess your boss? Guaranteed? I don't… I'm bad with names. I'm sorry.
Eclectic Opposition: Gucci Guaranteed.
Ali: [chuckles]
Levitation: Yeah.
Kalvin Brnine: Oh, this is a Cause thing? Are you with the…
Levitation: Um. Well, right now, I just work… I just work for my family business. [overlapping] It's Cascabel-Gardener Catering Cooperative. You can see it on the truck.
Kalvin Brnine: [overlapping] I can see the… Yea-yea-yeah.
Levitation: Yea-yea-yeah.
Austin: [chuckles]
Levitation: Um. I was curious, do you all have, like, a recruiting post that I could talk to?
Austin: [chuckle-sighs]
Sylvi: “I'm here to enlist!”
Austin: Truly!
Sylvi: “And I brought burgers!”
Austin: Truly!
Ali: [chuckles]
Keith: Huh.
Dre: Uhum!
Kalvin Brnine: [overlapping] You’re tryna…
Keith: [overlapping] I grabbed the thing…
Janine: [overlapping] Also, is this kinda like someone showing up…
[pause]
Janine: Sorry.
Keith: [overlapping] Sorry.
Janine: [overlapping] I was gonna say, is this kind of, like someone showing up who's, like, from… Oh god! What's that, like, really old tea company? Or, like, from House of Worth or something?
Dre: [overlapping] Hmm…
Janine: It's like: “Here’s a 500-year-old business and I'm just some kid who works here now” And…
Dre: Yeah.
Janine: [chuckles]
Austin: Well it's, like, it's, like, if you showed up and you were part of, like, a 500… You know? There's, like… 800-year-old Japanese… businesses? [overlapping] That exist…?
Janine: [overlapping] That's what I mean. Yeah.
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] Oh, like, the hotels?
Austin: [overlapping] But, like, imagine that business was founded by, like, [half-chuckling] two heroic samurai who saved their region from something?
Janine: Nintendo?
Dre: But now everybody knows you as the dude who brings sandwiches everywhere.
Austin: Right.
Janine: [laughs]
Dre: No matter how much you try to tell them: “No, really! I'm the seventh generation. It's my… — holds out fingers and counts on them —
[Austin & Janine chuckle]
Dre: … “great great great great great great great grandfathers.”
Austin: Right.
Keith: I grab the thing I sign for the sandwiches.
Levitation: [overlapping] Oh, that was…
Austin: Sorry! We didn't get the rest of your character description, I feel!
Dre: Oh, yeah! No, I wrote the rest!
Sylvi: Yeah.
Dre: Um…
Austin: I want you to read it for people to hear…
Keith: [overlapping] I just want to get the sandwich business out of the way…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah, do! I wanna hear it!
Dre: [overlapping] Okay. Yeah, yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] You know? I feel comfortable.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah, yeah
Austin: [overlapping] Because I need people to understand who's applying for a job.
Dre: Sure. This is Levitation Cascabel-Gardener. He uses he/him pronouns. He is a young man in his early 20s with light brown skin. Half his head is… I wrote shaved — I don't think it's shaved. I think it's, like… What's right above a 0 guard? I guess it's a 1 guard.
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: Buzz?
Austin: Buzz. [overlapping] It’s a buzz.
Sylvi: [overlapping] It’s a buzz.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.It's a buzz. Yea-yea-yeah. The other half has been grown out and is styled into, like, long braids going down to his shoulders. I can't… Did I write this somewhere? Oh, I had a face-cast for him and I don't think I wrote it somewhere. I'll have to look it up. Um… He's all tech-wared out. So he has a baggy pair of techware pants — they have, like, pockets all over the place. You know? Techware Kingdom Hearts here?
Austin: Yeah. Yeah.
Dre: There's, like… an additional waist part to the pants…? And those have, like, fanny-packs on the side? And there's also a harness that goes over his shoulders. So it's sort of like… It's not a complete cover-up.
Austin: [overlapping] Right.
Dre: [overlapping] It's like: “What if… What if you just cut the shirt part out of a cover-up?”
Austin: Sure.
Dre: Because underneath you got to see that he's got his uh long sleeve spandex top that you can basically see through.
Austin: [giggles] Uhum!
Dre: And he has a big poncho with a collar that you can pull up to, like, cover half your face. And the back of it is covered in feathers.
Austin: Like, actual feathers.
Dre: [overlapping] Yea-yea-yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Not, like, feather designs.
Dre: Probably a mix of both.
Austin: Is it like a bunch of… When you say “it's the back of it”, is it…
Dre: [overlapping] Well, here, let me, uh… 
Austin: [overlapping] Are they flat? Oh, do you have an image?
Dre: I have. Yeah. And as I've done all season my “Notes, etc.” is mostly just, like, [overlapping] here's images to explain what I'm talking about.
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, good. Yeah. I appreciate this. This is good.
Janine: [overlapping] Quick question: will this kid sell me molly?
Sylvi: [snorts]
Dre: I don't know, dawg. Trying to party?
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah, I hope so!
Keith: [overlapping] Second question: does he wear a poncho like Cascabel?
Dre: …ish.
Keith: Okay. [overlapping] So two poncho characters.
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, this is… These are good. Oh it's like a cape!
Dre: Yeah. [overlapping] The back of the poncho is, like, I think longer.
Keith: [overlapping] The feather.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Gorgeous.
Keith: [overlapping] Okay.
Dre: [overlapping] And it's almost capelike. Yea-yea-yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] That's cool!
Keith: Um…
Austin: All this… This stuff is all sick. These are… Oh, I see the fanny packs you're talking about.
Keith: [overlapping] Oh, I see, I see, I see.
Austin: We got to put these on Twitter. Or somewhere. On cohost. On cohost.
Dre: [overlapping] Oh, I found the face-cast. The face-cast is Luka Sabbat. L-U-K-A.
Austin: [overlapping] Ohhh, sure. Damn.
Dre: But, like, younger.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Okay!
Dre: [overlapping] Like, this is someone firmly in, like, their, like, 20, 21. I don't have an exact age. But…
Austin: Right. Sure.
Keith: Um…
Eclectic Opposition: Relevant skills?
[pause] 
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Austin: Is that… [overlapping] Is that in character?
Sylvi: [overlapping] In-character?
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Levitation: Is this the interview?
Kalvin Brnine: Wait.
Eclectic Opposition: What?
Kalvin Brnine: No. I… Not that you're not welcome. Are you… You're from here?
Levitation: [overlapping] Yeah. Well…
Ali: [overlapping] And Brnine sort of just gestures to the sky. [chuckles]
Levitation: The Mirage. Yea-yea-yeah.
Kalvin Brnine: Oh.
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Kalvin Brnine: Um…
Levitation: Yeah, if you were here, like, a thousand years ago, you would have known my grandpas and they're, like, a big deal.
Eclectic Opposition: Okay.
Levitation: Well, they're, like, my, like, great great great great great great great grandpas. But I just say grandpas ‘cause it's, like, you it's easier.
Eclectic Opposition: [overlapping] Sure.
Kalvin Brnine: [overlapping] Sure. Yeah.
Eclectic Opposition: [overlapping] ‘Cause you talk about them a lot?
Levitation: Okay… [sighs] Not, like… Not like that!
Janine: It's kind of… it is kind of giving, like…
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Janine: Oh! [overlapping] “Nice to meet you. My ancestors came on the Mayflower.”
Levitation: [overlapping] I just… I just met you people! I'm just… You know. I'm trying to let you know… I'm serious here!
Kalvin Brnine: Right. Yeah. Um… There's just a… a process. You know? And I don't know that those… Welcome. Hi.
Eclectic Opposition: Sorry. Hold on. One second. Can I talk to you for a second?
Kalvin Brnine: Yeah.
Levitation: [overlapping] Wait, me, or…?
Eclectic Opposition: [overlapping] What’s the process? No, not you.
Levitation: Sorry. I'll take a step back.
Eclectic Opposition: [overlapping] Yeah.
Levitation: Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Eclectic Opposition: [whispering] What's the process?
Kalvin Brnine: [whispering] Well, like, Millennium Break has, like, a whole screening…
Eclectic Opposition: [whispering] What are you… Another what? I just showed up!
Kalvin Brnine: Well, yeah. But, like, we had to make sure that you weren't, like, a fucking asshole. Or a spy.
Eclectic Opposition: Well, it seems, like, I showed up and then people [half-chuckling] did say that I was a fucking asshole. And then I just still stayed.
Ali: [chuckles]
Jack: And then I brought you a cop.
Keith: That was when…! [overlapping] That was when.
Janine: [overlapping] Also, you were trying to act, like, a spy.
Ali: [laughs] Brnine… Brnine does the thing where, like, you you, like, hit your hand out back of the palm… slap against Eclectic’s stomach and says:
Kalvin Brnine: You are an asshole.
Austin: [chuckles]
Eclectic Opposition: But there wasn't a process to figure that out! It just happened. [overlapping] It is true.
Austin: [overlapping] You were already with Leap.
Eclectic Opposition: I was with Leap.
Kalvin Brnine: Yeah.
Eclectic Opposition: I got a pass? I got a Leap pass?
Dre: [chuckles]
Kalvin Brnine: Yeah. I mean, Leap was, like, one of the founding members.
Eclectic Opposition: Okay.
Kalvin Brnine: [overlapping] If Leap is fine…
Eclectic Opposition: [overlapping] I mean, the founding member.
Ali: [chuckles]
Kalvin Brnine: [skeptically] Leap said that?
Eclectic Opposition: I… I think that… I think that by not saying it, he said it.
Ali: [chuckles]
Sylvi: [overlapping] He does that a lot, huh?
Levitation: [overlapping] [mock-shouting] I'm just going to start unloading this!
Kalvin Brnine: [overlapping] Please! Thank you.
Levitation: [overlapping] And you once let me know…
Kalvin Brnine: Thank you.
Eclectic Opposition: [overlapping] And what are your relevant skills?
Kalvin Brnine: [overlapping] Right up the ramp up there.
Austin: Jesset comes down the ramp to start helping…
Ali: [chuckles] 
Jesset City: Are you… Is it Levi[3] or Levy[4]?
Dre: Levitation, but all his friends call him Levy.
Austin: Alright. So comes down to help Levy. Um… Start to unload this thing. Again, lots of… Lots of energy coming from nowhere inside of Jesset. And also I think Jesset immediately is like: “Ah, look at this… Look at this…!” Like, Jesset — as a reminder — grew up in, like, among orphans and among… I think Jesset has big big-brother-energy? And instantly is like: “Who's this kid? Who wants to sign up? Can I help train this kid?”
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: “Can I help make this kid into something?” You know? Love the energy.
Eclectic Opposition: Wow, Jesset seems like he's doing great!
Austin: [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely!
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Can’t stop, won’t stop.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Havin’ a wonderful time.
Ali: Please. Yeah. That's great.
Jack: I can't make the sound that Motion makes with my mouth.
Austin: [chuckles]
Jack: But I can make it with two synthesizers. [chuckles]
[01:00:00]
[Austin, Ali & Dre laugh]
Art: [sighs] Ohh…
Kalvin Brnine: Let's just… I think it's a pacing issue. Right? Let's just feel it out? Give it a night maybe?
Eclectic Opposition: Give it a night? Till what?
Kalvin Brnine: [whispering] We don't know what the fuck is going on!
Eclectic Opposition: Oh. Sure. I thought you meant, like, have him sleep over. [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvi: Oh my god.
Kalvin Brnine: Listen. I… You know. We don't have… We're not a pamphlets organization. But. You know. Let him feel it, too.
Eclectic Opposition: Okay. So what do we say he's here now.
Keith: And it's… Dre. It's his new character.
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: “I can sense it.”
Art: And you're not careful!
Austin: You get a text from Gucci in the middle of this. Brnine? It says: “Did you get my gift?” And then a winky face.
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: [overlapping] Heeey!
Keith: [overlapping] Whoa. [laughs]
Dre: [laughs]
Jack: [laughs]
Sylvi: [overlapping] Wh… Huh?
Austin: [overlapping] It's the food. It's just the food, Sylvi.
Ali: It’s the food. It's just the food.
Sylvi: Oh, okay!
Dre: [from a distance] I have a lot of eggplants and peaches! This is a weird order!
Austin: [laughs]
Sylvi: [from a distance] Oh my god!
Ali: [whispering] Shut up. Shut up. [laughs]
Art: [laughs]
Ali: I text back “LOL be right back”.
Austin: [laughs]
Ali: Which is a weird thing to say in a text. [laughs]
Keith: [laughs]
Ali: [laughs] [unintelligible] Because it’s not like it… 
Keith: Yeah… You…
Sylvi: That's Brnine, though! That's my captain!
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: [chuckling] You get back the “see no evil” monkey and a question mark?!?
Ali: [laughs] Um…
Sylvi: Ugh, not the monkey… [overlapping] Not the “see no evil” monkey! Eugh…
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah! Shows the monkey and not just the regular cover your face emoji.
Ali: [exaggerated] This is crazy. Yeah. She…
Austin: [overlapping] Uhum!
Sylvi: [overlapping] I've lost so much more respect for her.
Kalvin Brnine: Um. Anyway, yeah. If you want I mean, if you want to talk to this kid and give me a vibe report later — I would appreciate that.
Eclectic Opposition: That's not my job.
Austin: Dre’s headphones just… Sorry.
Kalvin Brnine: Oh no! I mean,, like, between friends! Between brothers! Between where they’ll fit in!
Eclectic Opposition: Okay.
Kalvin Brnine: Okay. Uh… So. Levy.
Levitation: Yeah. [overlapping] Sir!
Keith: [overlapping] I'm looking…
Eclectic Opposition: No, no. Don't worry about it. Uh…
Levitation: Oh. Okay.
Sylvi: [laughs]
Eclectic Opposition: Relevant skills?
Levitation: Oh! Uh, okay, hold on! You're gonna love this.
Dre: Levy climbs into the back of the truck. You hear something very large, like, moving around in there. And he hops back out and he has… I'm just calling it a pile bunker — because that's what it is. If you've played Armored Core…
Austin: Uhum.
Dre: … you know what a pile bunker is.
Austin: What if you haven't?
Dre: You haven't — imagine if you could strap a hammer to your arm and then that hammer instead of, like, hitting things normally with a hammer instead that hammer is, like, attached to a giant piston and you just slam it into things.
Keith: Okay.
Sylvi: Yeah. [overlapping] It's the coolest shit in the world.
Dre: [overlapping] Yea-yea-yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] So it’s a lance…
Austin: [overlapping] It’s like a pneumatic compressor.
Dre: [overlapping] Yes.
Keith: Like, a pneumatic lance.
Austin: Yeah. But it instead of compressing downwards it, like, you punch with it and then all of that pneumatic energy releases, and it, like, fires forward. Sort of punching… Often a spear or a lance or a…
Dre: Uhum.
Austin: You know. Like a pile driver.
Jack: This is what Anton Chigurh… [overlapping] from No Country for Old Men…
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. I was just thinking of that.
Austin: [overlapping] Yes.
Jack: [overlapping] But if he was a mech.
Keith: [overlapping] It was metal instead of air.
Austin: [overlapping] That is correct.
Dre: [overlapping] Sure.
Keith: Yeah.
Dre: Uh, also it's, like, twice… Twice as tall as me.
Austin: Because you are the Scout.
Dre: I'm the Scout. Yeah.
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: And, specifically, I am the Giantslayer Scout which means that I have a Tier 3 Weapon.
Keith: Ooh! [overlapping] Very cool.
Austin: [overlapping] Perfect.
Dre: [overlapping] Tier 3 and is “a huge unique armament that you alone can wield.”
Keith: Whoa!
Austin: Do you just lift this thing up? With no effort.
Dre: Yeah.
[pause]
Dre: [overlapping] I work out!
Austin: [overlapping] What's the… how behind that? Do we know? Or is it a mystery?
Dre: Oh… I want to say that this is probably, like… Oh! He stole this.
Austin: [overlapping] Ohh! Ohhh…!
Dre: [overlapping] There's, like… a family museum that has a bunch of, like, Cascabel and Gardener Even’s old stuff.
Austin: Uhum.
Dre: And it's kind of been ignored as time has gone on… and so Levy just stole this out of the museum.
Austin: I meant more of how can you…
Art: Jacked your own family museum!
Austin: Yeah! [chuckles] I thought more how can you… how do you lift it and operate it? Is it training? [overlapping] Is it some sort of…
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin:   Okay.
Eclectic Opposition: What is that, a trick?
Levitation: No.
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Levitation: I can do a trick! You want to see a trick?
Eclectic Opposition: Okay!
Dre: I shoot it into the ground and I go shooting, like, 30 feet into the air.
Keith: Um… I…
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Dre: I do a flip.
Eclectic Opposition: [overlapping] This is enough.
Austin: [overlapping] Jesset leans over to you, Eclectic and is like:
Jesset City: [whispering] Kid’s good!
Keith: This is a good opportunity cut to, like — we don't have to end the scene, but I just think this would be funny — cut to inside…
Dre: [laughs]
Keith: … You know, find Brnine. Be like:
Eclectic Opposition: He's good.
Keith: [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: I fly by a window and wave at Brnine through it. [chuckles]
Austin: Uh-huh!
[they all laugh]
Austin: Vibes are good! Vibes are good!
Keith: Vibes are good.
Ali: [chuckles]
Keith: But we can do more… We can scene. [chuckles] I don't want to end your scene!
Dre: No, that's fine. [overlapping] That’s fine.
Keith: I thought it’d be really funny.
Dre: No. That's…
Austin: [overlapping] That’s kinda perfect.
Dre: [overlapping] I think that… that is a good vibes for Levy.
Austin: [sighs]
Sylvi: Yeah. [overlapping] He's good.
Austin: [overlapping] He’s great. Dre, I'm sorry that this is the second Divine season in a row where you've had to introduce a new character right at the very end. But…
Dre: It's fine. I'm really excited about…
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: … this young idiot.
Austin: He's good. Good vibes. Real Twilight Mirage Vibes that have been missing. There's, like, not just shades of Echo… Sorry. Of Cascabel and Even here. But also there's a little Echo. There’s a  little young shithead.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Which is a big part of the Twilight Mirage. Lots of young shitheads.
Ali: [chuckles]
Dre: [laughs]
Keith: Sort of opposite of Figure in some ways.
Austin: Right. Totally. Yea-yea-yeah.
Dre: Uhum.
Austin: Figure was a retired history teacher. You know? So…
Keith: [overlapping] Slash zombie.
Janine: [overlapping] I heard they're going to end Young Shithead soon because the shithead is getting too old?
Art: [laughs]
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: [sighs] Ohhh…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Bazinga.
Dre: [overlapping] I don't know, they've been doing Young Sheldon for a long time!
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Dre: [chuckling] I think Young Shithead's got a couple years left.
Austin: Uh-huh! Um. Alright. That sounds like a scene!
Art’s scene [01:06:29]
Austin: Who's left? It's Art, it's Brnine? [overlapping] It's me?
Keith: [overlapping] It’s me.
Austin: Oh, it's Eclectic. Right. You didn't actually… Okay. Yeah. So let's do Art and then we'll call it.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: And then we'll come back to do the rest.
Art: Um. So… I need to get myself into the finale.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Art: [overlapping] I need to get a character who can play in the finale.
Austin: Yeah.
Art: I’m looking over the stuff that I have dominion over in this part of our little game.
Austin: [chuckles]
Art: I think…
Austin: [half-chuckling] Why do you sound like a Batman villain?
Keith: It’s very Scar of you. [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Art: [overlapping] “Our little game.”
Austin: [overlapping] “Our little game.”
Art: [hoarsely] “Long live the king.” Um…
Austin: [overlapping] Right. Exactly.
Keith: [overlapping] “The pieces are falling into place!”
Austin: [laughs]
Art: Um…
Sylvi: Now I'm being [inaudible]
Keith: [laughs]
Austin: [laughs] [overlapping] Yeah, who are those pieces?
Art: [overlapping] [exaggeratedly] “I have an umbrella that shoots a grappling hook.”
Austin: [laughs] Oh, cool!
Dre: [intrigued] Ohhh!
Art: Is that I'm… I think I'm going to play Clem.
[pause]
Austin: [chuckles]
Art: Um…
Ali: [chuckles] [overlapping] Okay!
Art: [overlapping] It's going to be great, you're all going to love it. I'm going to do a great job.
Dre: [overlapping] God.
Sylvi: [overlapping] [shouting from slight distance] God!
Austin: Uh-huh!
Art: [overlapping] “Long live the queen!”
Sylvi: [laughs]
Keith: [overlapping] I want to know: Is this the first idea or the second idea? I’m not exp… Okay. Great.
Art: [overlapping] This is the first idea. I spent weeks trying to figure out Clem stuff.
Jack: [overlapping] Wait.
Art: [overlapping] And then this morning I'm like: “Isn't Crusade much more important?” And then it's like: “Nah, nah, nah! We'll figure that out on the fly.”
Keith: Oh, yeah. [overlapping] Clem is way more important.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah… Ehh…  But also more of an antagonist who gets to be a collective concern. [overlapping] You know?
Dre: [overlapping] Hm…
Art: [overlapping] Yeah. Well there's… Part of it's like “We should just settle… We just settle Crusade”— 
Keith: [overlapping] Good name by the way! Mark down Collective Concern! [chuckles]
Ali: [chuckles]
Art: It doesn't seem like it's how we should do it.
Austin: Yeah.
Art: So I had to get Clem on the board in a way… that works at all.
Austin: Right. [overlapping] And by on the board…
Jack: [overlapping] Are you saying that…
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, go ahead.
Jack: [overlapping] … you're playing Clem in the finale or that you're playing Clem in the next season?
Art: In the finale. I will not… [overlapping] I would never…
Jack: [overlapping] Okay. Right. I was, like, briefly… [chuckles]
Art: Clem… Clem's hard.
Jack: [overlapping] Like a cold terror.
Art: [overlapping] I don't know if you know this, Jack, but Clem is…
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Mm…
Art: Clem is difficult to keep in your brain.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah!
Art: [overlapping] Especially for me because I… She drifts toward Grand Magnificent for me.
Austin: [overlapping] Aaahh! Sure.
Art: [overlapping] Where if I do too much Clem it’s just like: “Wait.”
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. That makes sense. [chuckles]
Art: [overlapping] “This is just Grand Magnificent without any talent.”
Jack: [chuckles]
Ali: So Grand Mag… Sorry. [laughs]
Art: Wow!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Grand Magnificent [chuckles]
Jack: [overlapping] While we… briefly here…
Keith: [overlapping] Grand Dragnificent.
Jack: … I saw an absolutely incredible illustration on… Instagram earlier today that is just a new Clem. New Clem just dropped.
Art: Oh.
Austin: Oh, no!
Ali: Hmm!
Jack: I'm gonna link this…
Austin: Please go get us that new Clem.
Jack: Yea-yea-yeah. [overlapping] Let me just link this in the PALISADE chat…
Austin: [overlapping] Part of the diff… Well, not part of the difficulty. Part of what you are working with here, or maybe towards: it's worth saying that in Questlandia everyone is part of the same kingdom.
Art: Oh… no!
Austin: We’re gonna… [overlapping] Well…
Keith: [overlapping] Consumption’s back!
Art: [laughs] It's consumption, it's back!
Austin: What? What happened?
Keith: Oh, just the new Clem.
Austin: Oh my god! Oh my god!
Keith: [laughs]
Austin: This new… This new Clem! I almost said Clum.
Keith: [laughs]
Austin: “This new Clum is back.”
Art: [overlapping] This is where Clem starts to drift into Clum.
Austin: [overlapping] Really is giving Clum. Yeah…
Keith: [laughs]
Austin: This is extremely Iconoclast-era Clem to me, though.
Jack: Yeah.
Austin: And not just because of the… the nonrepetitive, pseudo-repetitive wallpaper pattern…
Jack: [chuckles]
Austin: … of flowers of different colors and the way that the paint seems to drip off of the canvas. You know? [overlapping] In the…
Janine: [overlapping] But also because her arms are made of ash and like…
Austin: Yeah. Uh-huh.
Janine: … three-times-burned wood?
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. Uh-huh. ‘Tis great.
Art: [overlapping] No, I love this painting, ‘cause this painting seems to be, like, a response to the idea of AI doing painting. I'm sure it isn't!
Austin: [chuckles]
Art: But it's, like, it has a few, like, of those quote unquote “flaws”. But instead of it being a problem, it's deliberate. And it's, like, the difference in…
Austin: Yeah. This is great.
Jack: This…
Art: … in making something versus not making something?
Austin: Jack, [overlapping] where can people go see this painting?
Jack: [overlapping] This painting is by Ingebjørg Støyva — that's I-N-G-E-B-J-Ø-R-G S-T-Ø-Y-V-A.[5] I think the painting is called “Epleblomst” — E-P-L-E-B-L-O-M-S-T.
Austin: Which means… [overlapping] Apple blossom.
Jack: [overlapping] I don’t know, might… Oh, man!
Art: [overlapping] Hmm!
Jack: It's creepy! New Clem just dropped!
Austin:  New Clem just dropped. You can find it on the Instagram page of Gallery M. Fjord… Or Galleria Mflord. Flord.
Jack: Nope! [chuckles]
Austin: Galleria M Fjord from seven weeks ago.
Jack: Alternatively, it could have been Gallery Ram Fjord, which is incredible. [chuckles]
Austin: [chuckles] Yeah. That's also pretty good. Yeah. Seems great. Oh, and in fact it is! It is that!
Jack: [overlapping] It’s Galleri Ramfjord?
Austin: [overlapping] Because the owner of it is Elisabeth Ramfjord. Yeah.
Jack: God! Ramfjord. I'm writing it down.
Austin: Yeah. Uh-huh! Um… Some other sick stuff on this Instagram feed. Anyway! Great new Clem just dropped. Um. What the fuck were we saying? Oh!
So the thing with Questlandia is everyone is part of the same kingdom — in the sense that a kingdom is… an organization. Or a nation? Right? So it doesn't have to be… It's not like: “Oh, you're the king. And you're the… knight. And you're the… whatever.” You know. Like, the roles theoretically are really broad. Right? You know, you might have someone who is a knight. But then someone else who is just, like, a librarian. Not from, like, the kingdom's official library. But just from, like, the library down the street. You know? They're connected by being in the same… nation. You know?
Um and for us that's probably Palisade and not the Twilight Mirage or the Qui Err Coalition — so I think we can get Clem there. But it… Clem has to be there as like… You know. Clem has to be able to be there and not just be someone that everyone wants to beat with hammers. To some degree. Or maybe they do want to beat her with hammers!
Sylvi: [laughs]
Austin: But you're going to need to do scenes with other characters at some point. Right? Or maybe you won't! Maybe it'll be weird and we'll do a finale where…
Sylvi: Maybe we'll just do one scene where we beat her to death with hammers!
Ali: [chuckles] Oooh!
Art: [overlapping] Alright. But then I'm gonna leave.
Dre: [overlapping] Get ‘em.
Art: [overlapping] I'm not gonna, like, hang out [chuckles] for the rest of the finale.
Keith: [laughs]
Art: [overlapping] If you beat me to death with hammers in the first scene, I'm gonna go to the park.
Austin: [overlapping] After that… Uh-huh. [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: Man… That's what I should have done.
Austin: [chuckles commiseratingly]
Dre: I'm kidding!
Austin: But you get what I'm saying. Right, Art? And that's part of why you're like: [overlapping] “Okay, I have to get on the board”. In a way.
Art: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: To some degree.
Art: Um. But what is the thing — I'm just gonna pull the group for a second — how do I get Clem not beat to death with hammers in the first scene? What… [chuckles]
[pause] 
Keith: Eclectic doesn't have any feelings about Clem.
Ali: [overlapping] It’s a v… Is…
Austin: [overlapping] That’s not true!
Keith: [overlapping] I mean, vaguely negative.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah, I don't really know her, either.
Austin: We’ve never told you about Clem?
Ali: Yeah. [overlapping] Come on!
Keith: [overlapping] Oh! Yea-yea-yeah. Okay. That's fair. I'm thinking… I was thinking of not… Never really met Clem. But…
Austin: That's true!
Keith: Um…
Ali: Also, Art, I'm so sorry to say: it is a very bad time to hear from Clem right now. [chuckles]
Art: It's what I got!
Jack: Why?
Ali: Immediately after the Figure stuff is not the time that anybody is [overlapping] answering those fucking text messages.
Dre: [overlapping] [devastated] Ohhh…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah, that’s a good point.
Ali: [overlapping] I am sorry to say.
Art: [overlapping] Well, my A) idea was that Clem went on a gigantic self-destructive war against Future, as sort of, like, twisted Figure revenge. But that… didn't work out. We couldn't make that…
Austin: It was hard to get there. I mean, you could still do that! You could also go on Team “Extradite and Destroy the Future”. Right? [overlapping] Or “the Divine Future”.
Janine: [overlapping] Didn’t she also have some previous twisted Figure revenge that was different and directed at Figure. [chuckles] 
Art: Yeah.
Austin: That's the thing. Yeah.
Keith: Yeah. Um. I should say, the negative Clem emotions that Eclectic would have would be like not emotional the same way that Leap’s…
Art: Sure.
Austin: That makes sense. Yes.
Keith: … are.
Art: Um…
Austin: But, you know, the thing that I would get to is like: if you were doing a version of this game about… [sighs] an actual kingdom, then maybe the creepy — you know — wizardly adviser to the king — the vizier! — would also be part of the kingdom. You know? And so you could play that game. I don't want to say that you… that Clem couldn't be a Player Character even though everybody else hates her. But it might be good to try to get to a point, if you want to play her, where you can imagine doing scenes with other characters. I just don't know how to get there in a move. You know?
Art: [overlapping] Um… I mean it’s…
Austin: [overlapping] But we can talk about it. I wanna talk about it.
[01:15:00]
Art: I think it's… The way that I think Clem tries to… You know, Clem obviously doesn't know that it's a finale or that we're playing a game that she has to participate in. But that that…
Austin: [chuckling] Uhum.
Art: But Clem…
Keith: But of all of us would be maybe the most likely to think in those terms!
Art: Sure.
Austin: Yeah. Sure.
Ali: [giggles]
Austin: [chuckles] Yeh.
Art: But Clem sees the… Cause is on the back foot — as everyone does. Clem has eyes… Does Clem have eyes?
Austin: [overlapping] You mean The Authority is on the back foot?
Art: [overlapping] The Authority. Yeah. Sorry.
Austin: Yea-yea-yeah. Yeah.
Art: And it's just…
Austin: Clem still has eyes…? Question mark? I guess I don't know. I said that and then…
Art: Does Clem have eyes?
Austin: Yeah. I guess I don't… I don't know!
Art: But Clem can see.
Jack: Does Clem still have Russian sage?
Austin: I don't know! No more Perennial connection — Iconoclast connection, now!
Jack: I mean, here's the short answer: I don't think Clem has eyes. Uh…
Austin: [overlapping] What’s going on there instead — I don’t know!
Art: [overlapping] But Clem has sensory perception.
[pause]
Jack: Yeah. Could see with the Russian sage and can probably now see with the dread power of the Iconoclasts. But something that I tried to say… or push through with, like, the Russian sage growing over her eyes is it's, like, there was a very specific sort of bodily… replacement happening there.
Art: Right.
Austin: Uhum.
Janine: And Clem's just Uzumaki now.
Art: And Clem is no fan of any of them… And so and so you get Clem’s military might being dispatched…
Austin: [overlapping] Hmmm…!
Art: … against Authority. Targets Authority fixtures. Clem is also interested in chasing The Authority off of this planet.
Austin: Right. Like… Is this a situation where the way in is that Mourning and Righteousness don't have any specific bad blood — emotional bad blood — with Clem to the degree that they wouldn't…
Jack: They might have ideological bad blood.
Austin: I mean, that's probably true! Especially with the Iconoclasts. That's the part that makes it really tricky. What's… in the General Mourning file under “I” for Iconoclast?
Jack: Two things that I think about with Iconoclasts. How Keen Forester Gloaming at the end of Twilight Mirage said that they essentially hunted them…
Austin: Hmm.
Jack: … like, to the end. But a few slipped into dreams — which is where Iconoclasts were. And I think… You know. Like, a violently destructive… force that swept over the Mirage for a long time.
Austin: Uhum.
Jack: I think the closest thing to a sort of amnesty with Iconoclasts is probably Axioms and Volition. But even then — as we spoke about earlier in the episode — sometimes Volition makes new Axioms and that sucks.
Austin: I just want to remind you a thing, Jack, that's extremely fun. Which is… they did not move into Dreams. [overlapping] That was a mistranscription that we have…
Jack: [overlapping] No, no, no! I’ve told you about this! I think I told you about this last time! It's, like…
Austin: You are now moving it backwards the other way, though.
Jack: Oh, I am going for the original mistake, yes.
Austin: Correct. Yeah. Which was… Keen says: “There could still be Axioms here. There could still be… We know the Iconoclasts still move and dream of something worse than Volition ever was.” Which now I guess we know is [chuckles] Clementine Kesh.
Jack: But the original transcription error said… “Axioms now move in Dreams,” comma “something worse than Volition ever was.” [overlapping] Which is amazing.
Austin: [overlapping] Which I love. And is… And which then I repeated this season and is now just true, also. Because they have been moving in Dreams. We’ve seen them move in Dreams.
Jack: [overlapping] But we do know that Keen did hunt Iconoclasts.
Austin: Correct. Yeah.
[pause]
Austin: But I do like the idea of them moving and Dreams! That's fun. So, we've been using it a little bit here and there.
Art: But anyway, at some point in the middle of the season or maybe not the middle of the season — who even knows where things are located in time anymore — I said that, like, Clem couldn't be elevated to a principal antagonist because she hadn't gotten any… she had just gotten the Iconoclasts stuff and then, you know, that stuff was also effortlessly defeated. And so this scene is more about… And maybe it's even just, like, a top level scene of, like…
Austin: Hm…
Art: Clem and Iconoclast forces successfully… hitting Authority targets.
Austin: Oh, right! Right, if we did want to put Lucia or Exenchester March in custody it would be kind of interesting if the person who got the capture… who's, you know…
Jack: Right.
Austin: …who did it was Clem. Which gives Clem a sort of, like… [overlapping] You know. Yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] And it's a sort of, like, weasley thing that Clem always gets forgiven. Was like: “Oh, well!”
Austin: [chuckles]
Keith: “She sucked forever! But then right at the end she, like, helped…?
Austin: [laughs]
Keith: [chuckles] “So I guess she's fine for now? Forever.”
Jack: The less-generous-to-Clem way of doing this is that she is sometimes a useful idiot. In terms of, like, capturing Fort Icebreaker. [chuckles]
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: Yeah.
Janine: A broken clock kills the right person twice a day.
Austin: That's right!
Keith: [overlapping] Right.
Austin: [overlapping] By falling on them. [chuckles] 
Keith: Yeah.
Jack: [chuckles]
Keith: 24 kills per day… [overlapping] Two right kills.
Jack: [chuckles]
Art: [overlapping] Maybe at this point people are even like: “Yeah! I think Clem is the one responsible for Icebreaker!” Not remembering that Clem was not responsible for Icebreaker. That was… everyone else involved in that mission contributed more than Clem.
Austin: [whispering] Oh that mission ruled so much!
Art: But I mean, most… [overlapping] some of those people were…
Jack: [overlapping] Clem has… Clem said capture it — but she did say capture it for me. That's critical.
Austin: [sighs] Yeah. So wait! What do you do? What is… So, if this is the direction this seems interesting to me, at least. This seems, like, the sort of thing that would — again,  potentially get Clem… not… [overlapping] not clemency.
Art: [overlapping] No.
Austin: … but a sort of…
Keith: [chuckles] [overlapping] Clemency.
Austin: [overlapping] … but a sort of… [chuckles]
Art: [overlapping] But a sort of…
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: … like, a temporary ceasefire, truce, whatever that looks like between… Like: “Alright. We do all want these…” I guess it does. I guess it does! It really depends on the Iconoclast thing and how far we can… You know. It's really… is the Iconoclast thing [chuckles] a dealbreaker? Is… [chuckles]
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: [half-chuckling] “Ladies, is it a red flag…”
[Dre & Ali chuckle]
Austin: “... when your queen has given her soul over to the — or vice versa, has taken control of — a soulless army of objective false truths?” Who could say?
Keith: It does sound like a nonstarter to some people.
Austin: I would love to other folks at the table to think about, like, what is this… Does this feel like a good reason to get Clem back on the stage?
[pause]
Austin: [overlapping] This stage of history?
Art: [overlapping] And not forever. For… at least some of the finale.
[pause]
Sylvi: The way I'm thinking of it now is that it's like [overlapping] this would be juicy drama if this happened.
Austin: [overlapping] Right. Yea-yea-yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] Hm.
Sylvi: You know? [overlapping] Like, I just aligned with Perennial and now Clem is here?
Austin: [overlapping] Uh-huh.
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, damn. Damn.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Like, from my perspective I'm like: “Oh, yeah! Another person to hate!” You know?
Austin: [overlapping] When your new partner's ex shows up…
Art: [laughs]
Ali: [sighs] God.
Sylvi: Yeah! [overlapping] Cori absolutely would be that type of girlfriend, too.
Austin: [overlapping] Uh-huh.
Sylvi: So. You know.
Ali: [whispering] Boy howdy. [in a regular tone] Yeah. I mean, two things are obvious is that, like… we can't and would not, like, to keep Art [overlapping] from doing the ideas that he would like to do.
Austin: [overlapping] Correct. Yea-yea-yeah. Yes.
Ali: And then the other thing is that it is sort of an interesting… we've already had tension between the Blue Channel and Millennium Break… Cause leadership at large.
Austin: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Keith: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Ali: And it's… I don't know that it's anyone-on-the-ship's… instinct to stop that from happening or even be a part of those conversations where they could.
Austin: Uhum.
Ali: So, if it's coming from, like, August and Mourning then… it is what it is!
Art: And I think Clem backs into this in spectacular Clem fashion. Because I think the first thing Clem does is hit the Temple of the Threshold. Because Clem would like to… find fake Gur Sevraq. [overlapping] And then instead finds, yeah, that no one's there.
Austin: [overlapping] And them instead finds that no one’s there. Right.
Art: [overlapping] And just, like, keeps… sort of keeps marching.
Austin: Right. Who do you end up getting? Is it Lucia? It sounds like it's not Crusade, because I think one of the big… Crusade being on the board is one of the most fun ones… it feels like.
Art: Yeah. So I think it's… I think it's…
Austin: Is it Exenchester or is it Lucia?
[pause]
Austin: I'm happy for… [overlapping] Exenchester. I’m happy…
Jack: [overlapping] I’m happy for it to be Lucia.
Austin: Yeah.
Art: I think it's better to be Lucia.
Austin: [overlapping] Okay.
Art: [overlapping] Just because of the history. The implied history.
Ali: [laughs] [overlapping] Oh, god…!
Austin: [overlapping] Oooohhh…! Yeah…!
Jack: [overlapping] Ohh…! [chuckles]
Ali: [laughs] She can't even be selfless about this!
Austin: [overlapping] Fuck off!
Ali: [laughs] [overlapping] She immediately goes after her own enemies!
Austin: [sighs] Ahh…
Ali: “Oh, hey! Can I borrow some of your resources for my own ends, by the way?”
Austin: [laughs]
Ali: “It is very much going to help you.”
Austin: Yeah. Uh-huh. “For the… Your war. I'm here to help your war and so I'm going after [overlapping] my old high school rival.”
Art: [overlapping] Yeah. Doesn't this all sound true, though?
Dre: [overlapping] Hm…
Jack: [overlapping] The…
[pause]
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: Sounds legit to me!
Jack: The…
Art: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Like, true to who Clem is… Uh-huh.
Jack: Oh, immensely!
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: I think also… The shortest and easiest answer to what do Righteousness and… Mourning make of Clem here is very much like: “Never stop your enemy when they're making a mistake.” Where it's like…
Austin: Hmm.
Jack:  … “This is playing in our favor right now.”
Austin: [overlapping] Right.
Jack: [overlapping] “Do we like what is happening here? No. Is this extremely dangerous territory? Yes. However…”
Austin: [laughs]
Jack: “If we can parley a captive out of this, and if we hold fast to the fact that this… this is not… this is not a trade for clemency.” For Clem-ency. Uh…
Austin: Uhum. [chuckles]
Ali: [chuckles] 
Jack: “Why stop her right now?” [chuckles]
Austin: So then do we leave this at… And I know we're playing really abstract here. But I'm kind of fine with that unless we want to get a Lucia–Clem… which I kind of do want to get a Lucia and Clem conversation on screen here. But… Do we… When we begin this… When we begin the finale, when we wrap back around to this, is it… have you turned Lucia over to them yet? [overlapping] Or are you beginning with this bargaining chip… as the game starts?
Art: [overlapping] No I think it's… I think it's better to get the… If we're going to do a scene, that should be the scene. Is… The scene should be the bargain. The turnover. Here's Lucia.
Austin: [overlapping] The turnover. The bargain.
Art: Do you want me to go after Exenchester or Gentian next? And, like…
Austin: Right.
Art: And when this is over I can stay? When this is over… You know. What's…
Austin: [snickers] 
Art: I don't know what the… thing is. But. You know. I live here now?
Austin: Uhum.
Art: As I have been living here? Or whatever.
Austin: [overlapping] You wanna do that scene?
Art: [overlapping] Yeah, sure. I've avoided…
Austin: Okay.
Art: I've tried to avoid voicing Clem the whole time! And here we are.
Austin: But here it is.
Keith: [overlapping] [very deep voice] Hey.
Art: [overlapping] [deep voice] Hey, yo.
[others laugh]
Art: [same voice] It’s Clem.
Austin: [chuckling] Ayo!
[laughter dies down]
Austin: You could do “Clementine!” instead of “Adrian!” But it doesn't work because it's her own name!
Ali: Hm…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Eh, she would.
Art: [overlapping] Clem at the end of a boxing match.
Austin: [chuckles]
Art: Shouting her own name.
Austin: [chuckling] Yelling her own name?!?
Art: [mock shouting like a ring announcer] Clementine!
Austin: That's very funny. [sighs]
Jack: It's a boxing match that she's lost. [chuckles]
Austin: [laughs]
Art: That is how Rocky goes.
Austin: [overlapping] [chuckling] That's how Rocky… that’s Rocky.
Jack: [overlapping] Well, sure. Yeah.
Austin: Alright. Where is this happening?
Art: Um.
Austin: Is it happening… Have you taken over the Temple of the Threshold [overlapping] as, like a…
Art: [overlapping] Absolutely! ‘Cause Clem definitely showed up at… an empty Temple. Right?
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. Uh-huh.
Art: [overlapping] And then that's like: “Okay, so this is Crown of Glass 2 now.”
Austin: Right. Yeah.
Art: Um… Or how… How many people know… How many people know what would… No. Let's…
Austin: [whispering] Okay.
Ali: [chuckles]
Art: How many people know that the Crown of Glass is Crystal Palace?
Austin: Uh. Eh. Few. I think.
Art: [overlapping] [deflated] Well… Okay…
Austin: [overlapping] Mourning might be one of them, though!
Art: So Clem can't try to be, like…
Austin: [overlapping] Of the people who would… it seems like General Mourning…
Art: [overlapping] “Just… I don’t know. When this is over I'll just get out of here. Just… I'll go to where Arbit is and…”
Jack: Oh, god. It is really fun if Mourning knows it — because Connadine didn't.
Austin: [overlapping] Ah, Connadine didn’t! Yeah…!
Jack: [overlapping] Or Connadine had some… You know… There's, like, hazy doc… I think it's such a nice demonstration of, like, the gulf in recordkeeping between your outside of the Mirage and your in it.
Austin: Uh-huh. Sorry. I had to take off my glasses and, like, rub my whole face thinking about Clem destroying Arbit and then getting a predictive Crystal Palace back. Not saying that's happening! But it's scary to think about.
Jack: Oh my god. Right! ‘Cause the way Arbit works is that it is… It works truly. But the machine has to be going.
Austin: [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Anyway. So Mourning is there. August Righteousness is there.
Jack: And I think someone else is here. I want to, like, broaden the… involvement here.
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: Righteousness and Mourning’ve put their money where their mouth is in terms of, like…
Austin: Local…
Jack: Ideally, someone from Millennium Break, actually. That would be incredible.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Jack: [overlapping] Because that would be the… someone from Palisade, someone from Millennium Break, and someone from the Mirage.
Austin: [overlapping] And someone from the Mirage. Yeah.
Ali: [overlapping] [chuckles] Is it Gucci?
Austin: [overlapping] It’s probably Gucci.
Ali: [overlapping] It can't be Gucci. Gucci… That’s the…
Jack: [overlapping] Holy shit! No, why can't it be Gucci?
Austin: [overlapping] Why can’t be Gucci?
Jack: [overlapping] Gucci…
Ali: [overlapping] Gucci has to abstain!
Austin: Why? [overlapping] Why?
Art: [overlapping] Yeah.
Jack: [overlapping] This is the most rancid situation on the history of the planet.
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: [overlapping] [laughs] Because she…
Jack: [overlapping] It's Gucci Garantine, Clementine Kesh, Lucia Whitestar and then August Righteousness… [chuckles]
Austin: Uh-huh!
Jack: … and someone from the Qui Err Coalition.
Ali: You don't think that Gucci has to be, like, an adult about this? [overlapping] And, like, trust that somebody else will take that meeting?
Art: [overlapping] No. I think Gucci has to be an adult about this and go to the meeting.
Keith: [overlapping] Gucci…
Art: I think that's the really…
Ali: [groans] [overlapping] Yeah…
Art: [overlapping] … unfortunate part about this is that sometimes being an adult means… this.
Austin: [overlapping] Brnine is just gonna get a DM…
Art: [overlapping] It means you have to watch Clementine Kesh offer Lucia, and, like…
Ali: [laughs]
Art: … the most cool voice she can muster — which is to say not that cool…
Ali: It's not Kalar? It's not…? [laughs]
Austin: No! It's, like… It's Brnine or it's… Gucci. Right?
Ali: [sighs]
Jack: It's Brnine or it's Gucci. And at the risk of stacking… nesting conversations I have to know what Gucci would text Brnine…
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: … [overlapping] if she's going to go.
Austin: [overlapping] It is… “Weird meeting today!”
[Jack & Art laugh]
Ali: Oh, that's actually perfect because the fight that's gonna break out of like: “Oh, I had a weird meeting today. I had this thing with Clem.” And then immediately after Figure's death —
Austin: [overlapping] Uh-huh!
Ali: [overlapping] … which Gucci sort of cares about, but not really —
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah, not really. Yeah.
Ali: … being, like… [mock-screams] [laughs]
Austin: Yeah.
[01:30:00]
Art: Those are all the sounds!
[Sylvi & Ali laugh]
Austin: “Remember Clem?” Question…
Ali: Yeah. I remember Clem.
Austin: Yeah. Exactly.
Ali: Anyway. “Have fun.”
Art: And it's, like… And I think, you know, Clem sees this as, like, this weird hero-moment. And so it's like…
Art (as Clementine): Is there a bounty on this?
[pause]
Jack: [laughs] I have to know what Clem's Iconoclast army looks like. In the meeting room of… [overlapping] You know.
Art: [overlapping] Um… What did the one that showed up look like?
Jack: Uh… Hoohhh…
Austin: Well… There's… Two things happening. There are Iconoclasts which we've seen show up in many different forms this season — going back to the one that tried to come out of Figure's chest… [chuckles]
Jack: Yeah. Like, gray goo-water… [overlapping] Tar…
Austin: [overlapping] Weird goo stuff. Big tall weird creature from the fake Duchess. Um… And then there's the Axioms which were… which was the… weird… monster-version of Figure’s first…? previous mech? Is that right, Figure? Dre, rather? What was the… No, no, no. It wasn't that. What was it?
Jack: [overlapping] Yeah, it was. Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Was that right? [whispering] Was that right?
Dre: Say it again! Say it again.
Austin: The Axiom that y'all ended up fighting in… the Chimera's Lantern.
Dre: Uhum.
Austin: I don't remember. Was that your original mech or something like that? [overlapping] But all messed up?
Dre: I think… I think so. That sounds right?
Jack: Yeah. Clem gave it a really funny name, like… “The something-or-another”. Clem had, like…
Keith: Yeah.
Dre: “The dirty nasty failure child.”
Jack: [overlapping] No, no, no!
Ali: [overlapping] Oh, yeah! It was, like, The Mongrel or something.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah…
Ali: [overlapping] Or, like, even more dismissive.
Jack: What did she call this…?
Art: But I think Clem's Iconoclast army at this point looks like…
Austin: The Ingrate.
Art: … a 5-year-old did a watercolor of, like, a Cthulhu setting.
Austin: [laughs]
Jack: Wow!
Sylvi: Nice. Nice.
Austin: Yeah. Okay. Good. [overlapping] And this is the person…
Keith: [overlapping] So a perfect Cthulhu.
Austin: [chuckles] Right. Exactly. Mind expanding. You know, Righteousness is going to lean over to Gucci and… to Mourning as they approach and like:
Austin (as August Righteousness): [whispering] This is who we're working with? Alright. Takes all kinds, I guess.
Clementine: We don't have… If you don't want Commander Whitestar, I can…
[pause] 
August Righteousness: No, let's talk!
Clementine: Great.
Austin: Jack, are you playing Mourning? And then is anyone playing Gucci? [chuckles] 
Jack: I'll play Mourning if we also get a Gucci. [chuckles]
Austin: Well, okay. [chuckles] If you don't, then we can't do the scene!
[Art, Jack & Ali laugh]
Jack: [overlapping] Sorry. Sorry. I’m… Sorry.
Austin: [overlapping] ‘Cause I'm not playing three…
Jack: Sorry. Clem was in the scene and I was possessed by Clem briefly. [chuckles]
Austin: Yeah!
Jack: Yeah, I'll play Mourning.
Keith: Is no one gonna play Gucci? I'll… I will be Gucci if I have to be!
Ali: [whispering] Oh my god.
Sylvi: [overlapping] I don't have a handle on her…
Keith: [overlapping] I’ll do it! I’ll…
Ali: [overlapping] [chuckling] I can’t do it! I can’t… [chuckles]
Keith: No! I've decided I'm doing it!
Ali: [half-chuckling] Okay!
Keith: We can stop. You can stop me if I can't do it.
Ali: No-no-no. Please. [overlapping] I would love… I would love to…
Austin: [overlapping] No, let’s do it.
Art: Uh… Wait. Who said the last thing and to who?
Jack: It was Righteousness saying is this… No. Um…
Austin: [overlapping] You said…
Jack: [overlapping] Righteousness was like… “Yeah. We'll take it.”
Art: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: Yeah… Yeah. I said. “Yeah. We'll talk.” Yeah.
Art: Great.
Clementine: I think… I have a lot to offer right now. I have a large and capable army… And we both want the same thing right now — which is the stels off… the planet.
Jack (as Tomorrow Mourning): You think you can control the Iconoclasts, but you cannot.
Clementine: Oh, I definitely can. And have. And will continue to do so.
Keith: No, I don't have it. Ali has to do it.
Ali: [chuckles] 
[pause]
Austin: Someone else could take Righteousness — and I could go to Gucci.
Ali: No. I'm here. Let's just do it. Let's just do it because we're doing it.
August Righteousness: How do we know that this whole thing isn't a setup? My understanding is you two go back. You and this Lucia. You're both Kesh people.
Clementine: You could ask your Kesh person.
August Righteousness: Different num…
[pause]
August Righteousness: My Kesh person's been killing Kesh people for a couple… for, like, a decade now or something is my understanding. [overlapping] Seems like you just started.
Clementine: [overlapping] Oh, I'll kill her if you want!
Art: And an Iconoclast… A weird-looking squid-Iconoclast starts, like, inching up behind.
Austin: [laughs]
Jack: [laughs]
Clementine: No problem!
Jack: What is Lucia doing? Lucia is… a professional. Lucia is quiet. You know. She's standing there, she's got, like, a kind of a fury.
Austin: [overlapping] Hmm!
Jack: [overlapping] She is so humiliated to have been captured by Clementine. But, you know: mouth shut, lips white. Um…. It's not a good idea for an Iconoclast to kill Lucia Whitestar.
Tomorrow Mourning: Hold your sword.
Art: Clem doesn't even, like, do anything that you can see and it stops.
Austin: Uhum.
Art: Clem's trying to show off. In… You know, the same way a toddler would. In a…
Austin: [overlapping] [chuckles] Uh-huh!
Art: [overlapping] In a “watch me jump off the high dive.”
Sylvi: Yeah. That's…
[Austin, Art & Ali chuckle]
Sylvi: You've nailed it with her so far. You've got it!
Austin: [sighs] 
Jack: I think that… Mourning turns and wants to talk under her breath to Righteousness and Garantine.
August Righteousness: Yeah.
Tomorrow Mourning: This is a mistake. We should seize both of them. We took the meeting. They're in the room. We're supported by our soldiers.
August Righteousness: Yeah.
Tomorrow Mourning: Gucci?
August Righteousness: It's a… It's a dangerous person to work with.
Tomorrow Mourning: As I understand it, Clementine has been a thorn in your side forever. I've read the documents. You've arrested her how many times? Two? Three? Let's give it another go.
August Righteousness: Why did you let her go? Have you arrested her before? For what?
[someone chuckles]
Tomorrow Mourning: It gets complicated, Righteousness. I don't know why they did it, but… Have you been through the files?
August Righteousness: [overlapping] No.
Tomorrow Mourning: [overlapping] She's arrested, then she's free again. Then they arrest her again.
Dre: [chuckles]
Tomorrow Mourning: Then she's free again. They try and kill her, but she comes back.
[pause]
Tomorrow Mourning: This is the moment.
[someone chuckles]
August Righteousness: [overlapping] Garantine?
Ali (as Gucci Garantine): [overlapping] She's more useful when she's motivated.
Jack: [chuckles] Fhu-huh…!
August Righteousness: Do you know how to motivate her?
Gucci Garantine: I can keep an eye on her if that's… what you're asking.
Tomorrow Mourning: Can you keep an eye on them?
Jack: And Mourning, like, points backwards to, like, an Iconoclast that is —
Austin: [chuckles]
Jack: … with the effect of, like, either one of those awful flashing strobes…
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Jack: [overlapping] … or, like, when textures z-fight in a video game — rapidly becoming and not becoming the chandelier of the room that we're in.
Gucci Garantine: I thought that was your value.
August Righteousness: [sighs] I just don't like it. We're going to bring a wolf to hunt dogs?
Gucci Garantine: [sighs] Well, yes. And then we'll have terms and… we all stick to them…
Tomorrow Mourning: You can't make terms with Iconoclasts.
Gucci Garantine: Yeah, but she's just… She's just a person.
August Righteousness: [overlapping] When you say…
Tomorrow Mourning: [overlapping] She is a person that has been hollowed out by the ichor.
August Righteousness: You say you're gonna keep eyes on her… you're going to, like, be part of… If you can be our person on the inside with her then maybe. But otherwise, I…
Gucci Garantine: Well, I have my own team to…
Tomorrow Mourning: What team is that?
August Righteousness: Brnine has the Blue Channel locked down, we've seen it.
Tomorrow Mourning: And…
August Righteousness: Not that you don't have a value add… I get it.
Gucci Garantine: [chuckles]
August Righteousness: You're good. You're really good with the big picture.
Tomorrow Mourning: With the loss of… uh… Figure. Figure in Bismuth.
August Righteousness: That’s just… It's just Figure. It's not… It was… You might have missed this. It was just Figure.
Tomorrow Mourning: Figure. I think Brnine is gonna… You know. Have you been in contact with them?
Gucci Garantine: You can doubt my opinion here. But you can't doubt my efficiency in our organization. I've spoken to my squad…
Jack: [chuckles]
Gucci Garantine: … and I can handle Clementine Kesh.
Jack: “I've spoken to my squad: Brnine reading the message ‘weird meeting today.’”
[Art & Ali laugh]
August Righteousness: I… It sounds like I… we agree: you can handle Clementine Kesh. But I don't want [whispering] Clementine Kesh without someone there for us. And frankly, again, I don't know that I buy that this whole thing isn't a scheme… on behalf of Lucia.
Tomorrow Mourning: I don't think that that's the case, August. Lucia and Clem go way back. It's… They would have had to have overcome some real interpersonal stuff and I don't see Clementine being the sort of person to do that.
Jack: What is Clen doing on the other side of the room?
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Art: Trying to look like she's got her shit together.
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Uhum.
Art: Like…
Dre: Uhum. Uhum. Uhum.
Jack: [chuckles]
Ali: I think Gucci just keep… Like, every time Mourning does one of these lore drops she just keeps squinting at… Mourning — like: “who are you?” And like: “What do you… This was my life.” Like: “What are…” [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] Hm. Uhum. [chuckles]
Ali: “How do you know this? Who are you?” [chuckles]
Jack: Very well-informed.
August Righteousness: I… I don't know how well you know the nobility, General. They'll put their shit aside as soon as there's a threat to the whole damn system.
Jack: [overlapping] Oh, this is something that…
August Righteousness: [overlapping] You tell that Clementine Kesh person that she could be the next… Princept?
Jack: [chuckles]
August Righteousness: Her and Lucia would be best buds by the time the night falls. Which—I don't know when that is anymore. [overlapping] But anyway…
Gucci Garantine: [overlapping] We’ll be caref… We’ll make her help us, and then we'll arrest her, and it'll be done with it.
Tomorrow Mourning: Why not do it now?
Gucci Garantine: There's too much at stake.
Jack: [chuckles]
August Righteousness: This breaks bad, it's on you.
Gucci Garantine: Fine.
August Righteousness: This breaks bad, it's on you, it's on the Blue Channel it's on Millennium Break.
Gucci Garantine: It's on me.
Jack: This is so funny, because… I don't…
Ali: [chuckles]
Jack: I can't tell the way you are playing this, Ali, but this is just as easily Gucci trying to get one over on Clem in the same way that it is…
Ali: [chuckles]
Jack: … Clem trying to get one over on Lucia. We've lined up three nobles… Three Kesh nobles… [chuckles]
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: [half-chuckling] I, unfortunately… The two of you were being like: “We don't agree with this.” And I was like: “What's going to happen to Art?” [laughs] So this is how Gucci feels in the scene!
Jack: No, I mean, [overlapping] I think this is the way to play it, right?
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah, it’s good.
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Yea-yea-yeah. To me, the best thing possible here is to make Gucci have to be… aligned with Clem… [chuckles]
Jack: [overlapping] Again!
Austin: [overlapping] … in a terrible way. Again.
Art: [overlapping] Yeah, that’s…
Austin: [overlapping] That's the juice.
August Righteousness: Alright. Fine. Do you want to go deliver the news?
Gucci Garantine: Mourning can do it.
[someone chuckles]
Tomorrow Mourning: What?
Jack: Just, like, turns of…
[Ali & Dre laugh]
Jack: [exaggeratedly] “What? Why me?”
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: [overlapping] “I'm not even from here!”
Austin: [overlapping] [laughing, quoting 50 Cent] “What he say fuck me for?”
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: “I said this was a bad idea!”
Gucci Garantine: Be…
Jack: “You can't…!” Okay. Fine. This is not Mourning.
Gucci Garantine: She'll believe it if it's from you. If I walk over there she'll know that I…
[someone chuckles]
Gucci Garantine: Can you just…
August Righteousness: She'll know that you what?
Art: [laughs]
Tomorrow Mourning: She’ll know that you want?
Gucci Garantine: That I advocated.
Tomorrow Mourning: For… [overlapping] For her?
August Righteousness: [overlapping] Good! We want her to believe you! You… You did advocate!
[Ali & Keith laugh]
Tomorrow Mourning: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Austin: [laughs] Gucci…!
Tomorrow Mourning: Why don't you want her to believe that you advocated for her?
Sylvi: [laughs]
Keith: [giggles]
[pause]
Tomorrow Mourning: Why don't you want that?
August Righteousness: Oh my god…
[pause]
Tomorrow Mourning: [overlapping] This is the person you're putting your faith in, August?
Austin: [overlapping] He didn’t say “Oh my god.” That’s not a thing he says.
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: [chuckles] What…?
Ali: No, I can play this differently. This is fine. Um…
Keith: I love… I love that.
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: I think that's hilar… I think it's so funny. And I think it's true! I think you don't want her to know!
Jack: [overlapping] It is…
Austin: [overlapping] No, of course! That’s great! Of course!
Keith: [overlapping] ‘Cause you know Clem! The lie isn't that you don't want her to know, the lie is that you can handle her. [chuckles] That's the lie!
Austin: That's the lie.
Jack: [overlapping] Gucci is…
Keith: [overlapping] Also, there's an Iconoclast in the background, [overlapping] a big ear just pointed towards y’all.
Art: [overlapping] Yeah, the Iconoclast…
Austin: [overlapping] [laughs] Uh-huh!
Art: Like, Clem is doing a good job of succeeding at looking cool and the Iconoclasts are starting to look like eager… monsters?
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Ali: [chuckles]
Art: [overlapping] Like, they're kind of leaning forward. Their eyes are getting big.
Austin: There's that scene at the beginning of the Labyrinth where Jennifer Connelly's character is getting close to saying the magic words [overlapping] that are going to summon the Goblin King?
Jack: [overlapping] [chuckles] Oh, yeah! All the goblins are hearing it.
Keith: [overlapping] Oh, yeah! [laughs]
Austin: Little goblin muppets are all, [overlapping] like, leaning forward?
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: Like: “She's gonna say it! She's gonna say it!”
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: [overlapping] And that's what's happening with the Iconoclasts right now.
Art: [overlapping] Yeah.
Jack: The additional layer here is that we, the cast of Friends at the Table, are the little goblin muppets going: “Oh, put them in a room together!” [chuckles]
[others laugh]
Ali: Okay. Then… [clears her throat] I know what Gucci says. And she says: [sniffs]
Gucci Garantine: Like I said, she's best if she's motivated, and if she thinks that she still has to win me over, this is how it will work.
August Righteousness: Alright. Then let's play it that way.
Tomorrow Mourning: [overlapping] [sighs] Alright.
August Righteousness: [overlapping] You come over… You make it clear that she needs… to prove it to you. I'll make a big show of how, okay, she's effective. Then you… got to be the person who says, “Prove it to us more.”
Gucci Garantine: Okay.
[Sylvi & Ali chuckle]
August Righteousness: Um… Clementine?
Clementine: Yes?
August Righteousness: [overlapping] We’ve given some thoughts…
Ali: [laughs] Can I just take a pause and say maybe The Cause ain’t shit?!? [laughs]
Art: [laughs]
Keith: [shouting] I've been saying!
Austin: [shouting] I mean, this… The alternative here is that we beat her to death with hammers! [chuckles]
Keith: [laughs]
Ali: I know. No, I know. [overlapping] No, I know.
Sylvi: [overlapping] I mean…
Dre: [overlapping] Next week. Next week. Next week.
Ali: [sighs] It's just so funny! Okay. Anyway.
Jack: [overlapping] I cannot believe… This is the…
Austin: [overlapping] This is bad. I mean, this is the dilemma of trust.
Jack: … fourth arrest of Clementine Kesh that has gone wrong.
Austin: Well, this is an arrest! We didn't set this up as an arrest. We set this up as a…
Ali: [sighs]
Sylvi: [overlapping] She can’t keep getting away with this.
Austin: [overlapping] … an exchange.
Ali: Are we sure?
Austin: [overlapping] We should just…
Ali: [overlapping] Art cannot just have a bunch of scenes none of us are in or only in, like… [laughs]
Austin: No. A core… A core thing in Questlandia is that you have relationships to the characters to your left and right.
Ali: Yeah…
Jack: [overlapping] I think this is…
Austin: [overlapping] And I guess they could be bad relationships. [chuckles] 
Art: [laughs]
Austin: But that feels wrong.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah!
Jack: [overlapping] I really do think that this is extremely consistent with all these characters.
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: I think that this is a good play. I think that… lining up the Kesh nobles in, like, a game of trying to humiliate the other and also everybody — with some exceptions — as soon as they get their hands on an Iconoclast being like: “Oh, maybe I'll make it work!” [chuckles]
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: Yeah. It's just a… You know. If it all goes bad, this is, like, fatal tragic error on behalf of General Mourning and August Righteousness. [overlapping] You know?
Keith: [overlapping] You know what they say: a tool is only as good as its carpenter.
Austin: [chuckle-sighs] That's what they say!
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: [overlapping] Clementine…
Jack: [overlapping] Also, from our perspective…
Austin: [sighs]
Jack: Gucci is good. Gucci has done her job well.
[01:45:00]
Austin: Yeah!
Ali: [chuckles]
Jack: As, like, the…
Keith: [overlapping] Who's our?
Jack: Uh, The Cause’s. Righteousness and Mourning. Right?
Austin: Right.
Jack: [overlapping] Like, we see Gucci taking credit on some level…
Austin: [overlapping] Right.
Jack: … for the work of the Blue Channel.
Keith: Right. Because she's a worm.
[silence]
Austin: [chuckles]
Jack: [laughs]
Keith: [shouts] She's a worm! She's a horrible worm!
Sylvi: We… Eh. Okay. 
Jack: [chuckles]
Austin: “That worm is your captain's girlfriend! Okay?” Maybe.
Keith: [overlapping] I don't have a captain!
Ali: [overlapping] Who said that?
Austin: No one said that. I guess no one said that!
Art: [laughs]
Sylvi: Brnine: “Hey! Hold on! Who said that?”
Jack: The Goblins all chittering in the background in that scene. [chuckles]
[Austin & Ali laugh]
Sylvi: “Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I'm not trying to get tied down here!”
Jack: Okay.
Austin: Alright.
Ali: [chuckles] 
Jack: [clears their throat]
August Righteousness: Clementine, we…
Sylvi: Okay.
August Righteousness: We gave it some thought. We've been thinking: there's nothing better to hunt a dog than a wolf.
Jack: [chuckles]
Dre: Jesus…
August Righteousness: So. As long as, General and Garantine, you're good with it…
Art: And is, like, eying Gucci to be like: “this is where you have to make her think…!”
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: “... that you, that she has to prove herself to you still! That's what you said!”
Ali: Um… Oh my god, what's the word I'm looking for? Um… [sighs] [chuckles] I was trying to say… Um.
Gucci Garantine: Yeah. This arrangement will work on a trial basis.
Clementine: I'm honored to be your wolf, cousin.
Sylvi: [groans]
Dre: [sigh-groans]
Ali: [chuckles]
Dre: Man, I'm glad Figure's dead.
Janine: What hunts wolves?
Sylvi: [overlapping] Goddamn!
Ali: [overlapping] Are they cousins?
Dre: [overlapping] Didn't want to let them see this shit!
Jack: I think that she meant, like… a non-biological cousin.
Art: Yeah.
Ali: [chuckles]
Sylvi: [overlapping] Cuz.
Art: [overlapping] An abstract cousin.
Ali: Ohh!
Austin: Like… [overlapping] Cousin. Like cuz.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah. It's like…
Art: [overlapping] Yeah.
Dre: It's, like, Brian from 2 Fast 2 Furious.
Art: Yeah.
Ali: Right.
Austin: [laughs] Right! [overlapping] Yes. Exactly.
Art: [overlapping] Or, like, they’re… we're all…
Austin: They're both Kesh.
Art: … you know, the human family.
Austin: Oh my god!
Sylvi: [groans]
Austin: [chuckles]
Jack: Woman rippling with Iconoclastic power. [chuckles]
Austin: “We're all humans here!” [chuckles]
Jack: [chuckles]
Austin: [chuckling] Oh, there's only one human, it's only Gucci at this point, actually!
Jack: [laughs] 
Austin: ‘Cause it's Qui Err, it's a Delegate and it's an iconoclastic Clem?!?
[pause] 
Austin: The human family is very big.
Art: Yeah.
Austin: Is the thing.
Art: We're all… We're all god's cousins.
Austin: [sighs] [chuckles]
Dre: Hm.
Keith: It’s just us! A room full of people!
Austin: [chuckles] A lone hand… gigantic and rancid…
Art: Wait…
Austin: [overlapping] … pulls itself across the ballroom floor.
Art: [overlapping] Did that end with Gucci is leaving to supervise Clem or not? We… Did they decide not to do that?
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. Yeah. Right?
Keith: [overlapping] At some point that was the deal. And then it’s…
Jack: [overlapping] She is…
Art: [overlapping] Then…
Jack: Righteousness…
Austin: I was pushing for that. But I don't know that it got all the way there.
Ali: No, I think that was… The sort of, like… “Well, the Blue Channel's fine without you. So why not go do that…” [overlapping] is like, not… Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] That was my case!
Art: So someone gonna tell… [chuckles]
Austin: That you did…
Art: … Clem that?
Ali: Oh, right! Okay. Sure.
Gucci Garantine: To assure your commitment to the liberation of Palisade you'll be under supervision. Mine. As a representative of Millennium Break.
Clementine: Oh goodie! It's been so long since we've had our slumber parties!
Austin: [chuckles quietly]
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvi: God…!
[pause]
Sylvi: Okay.
Austin: Just shoots Mourning a look. You know?
Jack: Yeah. Same! Same! Look…
Austin: I… I…
Sylvi: Elle Evensong doing the Soulja Boy…
Austin: [laughs]
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah! [chuckles]
Sylvi: [overlapping] … she stole my whole flow?
Austin: [overlapping] “Bar for bar…” Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] “Word for word, bar for bar.”
Austin: I'm just telling you, I have the hammers in the trunk.
Art: [laughs]
Keith: [chuckles]
Sylvi: [laughs]
Jack: There are, like, units of Cause soldiers standing outside right now. You know? [chuckles]
Austin: Yeah. It's fine. We might lose that fight!
Sylvi: [overlapping] With the hammers, yes.
Austin: [overlapping] This is a hard…! This not an easy fight, to be clear! Clementine temporary truce… Temporary alliance.
Art: Clementine, leader of the wolfpack.
Jack: As an Iconoclastic Hunter.
Austin: [half-heartedly] Awoo…
Sylvi: Oh my god!
