Recap
Austin: PALISADE is a show about empire, revolution, settler colonialism, politics, religion, war, and the many consequences thereof. For a full list of content warnings, please check the episode description.
It has been about 90 minutes…
[“No Rest” by Jack de Quidt begins]
Austin: … since you’ve defeated Artifice; broadcast Cas’alear’s message and took control of the most important Shard of the station that Perennial calls home. Reinforcements have arrived and barring one sniper and a handful of nanobeasts skittering in the dark all threats have been accounted for.
But try as you might, you cannot find a moment of rest. Maybe you close your eyes or shift your sensors into passive mode or simply turn to old reliable techniques — breathing deep, fidgeting with cards, smoking, listening to music — none of it works! Not for you, not for anyone here preparing for what's to come. And it isn't nerves: afterall, some of you don't have nerves. It's her.
It's the fleet. It's the Ekpyrosis drawing nearer, emitting a steady stream of her. It's Motion, molecular. She's in the air here — she is the air here. And even with Brnine's Jury-rigged device keeping everyone safe, you nevertheless have a preview of what's to come. Not just for those near Motion. But for those all across the Galaxy if she can succeed at rewriting The Perennial Wave, reshaping Kalmeria in her image.
There will be no rest in Motion's world. Not — as some distant relatives of hers might have wanted it — a world of endless work or a world built towards profit simply a world without quiet stillness: a world where the only division between day and night is the color of the sky. A world with no wasted time, no wandering thoughts, no shower-stall epiphanies, no staring up at the constellations — man-made or otherwise. And of course, a world without death, too. A world where consciousness might dim, but never go dark. And, you learn in the most troubling of ways, a world where what was once death, becomes instead her domain.
The first time it happens is with Passiflora, the naive and obstinate Elect of Artifice, the Divine which was building the Portcullis Gates until you stepped in. She crawls from the wreckage, reknit by Motion's black molecule, scars and burns repaired by a mesh of what looks like fluctuing, living carbon-fiber. Alone, she was not a threat. She was, however, a puppet — given direction by Motion, high sorceress of death. Even now, even locked away, she mumbles Motion’s words:
Austin (as Passiflora): I'm not coming for you. I'm already… here.
Austin: And now you know what you face. You see plainly what Motion will deliver if she can get to the power-terminal and rip control away from Perennial. The so-called “Adversary” has been an agent of chaos in the galaxy for thousands of years — and as the Figure once learned — for countless cycles thereof. But Motion…! Motion will be a more active goddess: fanning a stellar wind that will turn the wheel, unbroken, forever.
[“No Rest” by Jack de Quidt concludes]
Introduction [00:05:03]
Austin: As you see, I have covered up [chuckles] the top of the map. That kind of zoomed-in portion of… the bit of the Ring around the Center of the Galaxy, because there's a lot of stuff there and it was really distracting…
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Austin: … when now we are shifting to a broader… kind of scale of conflict. That second scale, which — as a reminder for the listener — is a kind of zoomed out picture of this one tiny… tiny part of the Ring that centers the Galaxy. Which is like a ring, but also kind of, like… there's also orbs and stuff floating around. It's a whole thing. But we're really zoomed in on it. Um… And so it's, like… There's a… bunch of, kind of, broken-up rectangular bits of what is this kind of big space station.
Everybody is gathered on this kind of center bit that you can see. You can see the Blue Channel. You can see all of the reinforcements that you got — like the Third Opus which is where KO and AO Rook were; the Mosaic True, the kind of Apostolosian reinforcements who came in; both the Star-Crossed ship and the Stolen Cameo, who've been here the whole time obviously — and then the five of you kind of laid out across the middle here. Brnine, again, I have a Brnine token instead of the Blue Channel one. But, you know. At this scale I think we probably only need one or the other. Likewise, there's a Mo token up at the top just in case we need it. We can kind of decide what we want to use. Um.
So, again, for the listener: there's kind of, like… floating islands of kind of silver and black, which are these kind of the bits of this disconnected space station that orbits the center of the Galaxy. Which of course, again, means it's the biggest thing that exis… [half-chuckles] It's a galactic scale thing. Um.
There are also three Portcullis Gates, but only one of them is active — that's the one that you took over the other —, two did not get finished being built so… they are just… They're not activated. No reinforcements are coming through there. I've left them there because canonically they are there, but they are not turned on despite being colored in red. Do you all see those? That's… I'm not… Okay. Um. And then…
And then to the left there's the stuff that's about to appear. Because it's about to kind of come over the, I guess, Galactic… [chuckles] horizon? Or I guess maybe it's… they're coming into the scanner range, or sight range? There's the fleet that approaches to the west. And I will slowly start revealing that. There are, of course, a bunch of regular-ass Pact enemies… that I've just labeled Pact #1 through #6. And these are not individual units at this scale. Right? These are, like: “hey here is a group of…” You know, whatever. “Ten guys.” Right? This is the… when you play [sighs] Was it… Three Houses [overlapping] where you could attach, like, a unit to your guys. Right?
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah. It’s been a lot of them, now. Yeah.
Austin: Yeah. Or if you played Unicorn Overlord you play…
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: Ogre Battle, like, a lot of those do the thing where it's, like… Or Advance Wars.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: Right? Where it's like: “Oh, it's not one guy with a gun. It's 10 guys with a gun. And that's a unit.”
Keith: Hm.
Austin: That's what these are. Right? [overlapping] Um, and… There…
Keith: [overlapping] Some sort of small gang. But in space.
Austin: I think they're bigger than a small gang! [half-chuckles] I think that they are a big gang! I think these are big gangs.
Ali: [overlapping] Whoa…
Keith: [overlapping] These are big gangs?
Austin: Yeah. A hundred percent.
Keith: Wow.
Ali: [overlapping] Oh, boy…
Keith: [overlapping] The much rumored big gang?
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: People have been saying for years what will they do when a big gang [laughs] shows up?
Keith: [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Um… The second thing that comes into view uh kind of overwhelms and is — I think, maybe the most obvious thing — and that is Ekpyrosis, which is the flagship of this… of this fleet. This is the ship, the gigantic supership that Brnine killed Dahlia on…? You may recall that it is sort of a… it shifts between this kind of, like, floating hanging-garden pyramid shape, and a big gun… A big space gun, that you saw blow up a planet once? I guess Brnine, you saw it blow up a planet. I don't know that anybody else actually saw that. Um. And that is still kind of gross and uh dripping with Commitment…? [half-chuckles] Hate to be dripping with Commitment.
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Austin: That's a heavy one.
Dre: [laughs]
Austin: Um… And theoretically Motion is somewhere in there, also. Um. And then there are, of course, two other Divines. One of them has been chasing you for the better part of a year, Cori…
Sylvi: Yeah…
Austin: And that is Present. The Divine Present. And maybe a thing here worths saying for Thisbe, who is of course now a student of the Divine… Present doesn't seem to have an Elect… Neither does Ekpyrosis. Or, sorry. Neither does Commitment/Motion/… I guess Integrity is gone now. Right? So, Commitment has taken over the Ekpyrosis. As far as you can tell, there's not, like, a human or a Columnar or something else in there as, like, the pilot. There's just Motion. And Present never took an Elect after you killed Gallica, Cori. So there's that. And then finally at the actual front of this is a burning bright red dot. And that is the Divine Valour — who is about as big as a po… a poster-boy…
Dre: [chuckles]
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] …as there is for the Pact.
Sylvi: [overlapping] [chuckles]G As a Pokémon?
Keith: [chuckles] I thought you were going to say about as big as about as big as a pope!
Austin: About as big as a Pokémon. No that's…
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: There's clearly other bigger Pokémon here already! Present and Ekpyrosis are bigger! But it is the most pokémon-y one here, [overlapping] I guess actually.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah. That’s what I thought.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. It looks like Ho-Oh.
Austin: That’s… It is… It is kind of Ho-Oh adjacent. If I'm remembering how Ho… Yeah. It is… It is exact…
Janine: I was thinking Lugia.[1]
Austin: You were thinking Lugia.[2]
Janine: Yeah…
Dre: [overlapping] Was it Lugia?[3] I always thought it was Lugia.[4]
Sylvi: [overlapping] I was… I was gonna say, is that how that's said?
Ali: [chuckles]
Janine: It's probably Lugia.[5]
Keith: I believe it's Lugia.[6]
Janine: It's all fake! [overlapping] It’s all… 
Dre: [overlapping] Yea-yea-yeah. It’s all pointless.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah, but they say it on TV.
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah…
Austin: They do say it on TV.
Sylvi: [half-chuckles] It’s real to me, damn it!
Austin: It's more, like, Ho-Oh, because it is red. It is a big red… Valour is a big red bird. Famously… called The Red Roc… in kind of, like, stories about it. Um. Valour's Elect is… Xiphion, AKA Zig’ell Barbos — who uses zig/zigs or he/him pronouns — and showed up… has shown up a few times now across our… is, like, a classic character who could have a whole show about him, but it's just not his fucking show. But, like, he has to show up in the places where he has to show up? And here's a place where he has to show up!
This is, like, used to be Cas’alear’s right-hand man / very clear, like, BL love interest, now turned rivals? Long-term rivals, I guess? And is the sort of de facto Honorable Knight of The Pact — is someone who has helped them win battle after battle; really believes in the vision that they offer of a more free Galaxy; has not seemed to catch on the fact that he is flying incredibly close to a big boiling black evil [chuckles] pyramid. You know? The Ekpyrosis seems to not freak zig out so much. So… You know, sometimes you just you got to make do with what you got to make do. If you want to make the Galaxy a better place and zig is doing that. And you know that zig is, like, a… one of the best pilots in the galaxy type beat. So that's what's coming.
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: And there aren't more coming. This is it. Right? Which is good.
Keith: Oh, this is it?
Austin: Yeah. [half-chuckles] Just these three Divines [overlapping] and their six big gangs!
Dre: [overlapping] It could have been way worse!
Austin: [overlapping] It could’ve been worse!
Keith: [overlapping] These six big… These three Divines in these 60 ships.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] And these 60 ships/mechs.
Sylvi: [overlapping] You scared or something?
Austin: And one of these things is, like, one of the biggest things visually we've probably seen on the screen. Right? The…
Keith: I'm just saying, it took us how many episodes to defeat, like, twelve mechs of just… [overlapping] right before this?
Austin: [overlapping] Well, there’s good news! Which is you are of course surrounded by your own allies. Right?
Keith: True.
Austin: The Third Opus and the Star-Crossed both… Sorry. And the Mosaic True both showed up with dozens of their own mechs. Right? And I… So I think the way [chuckles] I would love for this to work is to think about yourselves as those sorts of extended units from tactical RPGs like I was just talking about. Right? The thing of like: it's not just Cori, it's Cori and then some. It's Cori and then some assigned soldiers [overlapping] who've arrived from the Third Opus. Right?
Sylvi: [overlapping] Oh, yeah. It's not just Levi. It's Levi and Levi's bois. Right? [overlapping] Levi’s bois…
Keith: [overlapping] Sucks to hear that on the comms: “Hey, it's Cori and then some!” [overlapping] Damn.
Sylvi: Wow.
Keith: [overlapping] “I'm and then some?”
Austin: Uh-huh. Yeah. Those are your official unit names. And you… So I think that there's, like, a sort of zoomed out scale here. Obviously, we can still zoom in on particular instances. Um. But I… The fight has to be at this scale for it to be functioning. And I don't know exactly what your plan is. A couple other important things: as she gets closer Motion's influence increases. I've zeroed out everybody's Motion Clocks and you'll say to me: “no you haven't! You set them all at 1!”
Sylvi: [laughs]
Austin: And that's ‘cause that's as long as they go anymore.
Dre: Ohhh…!
Austin: But some people had, like, a 3! Like, Cas’alaer had a 3.
Sylvi: [overlapping] That rules. That was really stressful.
Austin: [overlapping] That’s just down to 1 now. So that’s good. Other people were at…
Dre: [overlapping] That’s much better.
Austin: Other people were at zero, it's up to one now. I’m sorry. That's just how it works. She's closer. She's here. She's broadcasting into the ether. You know?
Dre: Hmm.
Keith: Damn.
Austin: [chuckles]
Sylvi: Oh…
Austin: Sylvi in the chat says…
Sylvi: I thought I got by…!
Austin: “Cori and the Dad Smashers. Wait, no. Crushers. Harder to misinterpret.”
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: No we're going to say Dad Smashers.
Sylvi: Okay.
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: I'm pretty sure.
Sylvi: Oops.
Austin: So, yeah. That's… These are the stakes, the objectives are what they were before: prevent Motion and The Pact from reaching the Core; defeat Motion, Present and Commitment / the Ekpyrosis — and now I've revealed also Valour is there. And… You know? I think you've kind of done the job of destroying or disabling the Portcullis system. [overlapping] So I'm gonna cross that one out, actually.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Hell yeah. 
Austin: They, like, don't have… A thing that is off the table is… They're not going to show up and fix that. You know what I mean? They don't have what they need to fix those units, like, in the middle of a fight. You know? So. You know! I'm kind of curious what the vibe is. Is the… Is there a plan that's emerging here? I'm not gonna make us reroll Plan and Prepare [chuckles] and stuff like that. But… But what is the vibe on this kind of part of the station, kind of Perennial’s… you know, home base, Perennial’s shard of the station? Is there a…
Sylvi: It's go time for me! At the very…
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: Like, I'm ready to fight. I have to be. I'm The Perennial One now.
Austin: Yeah. This is true.
Keith: I'll say — from me, from Keith — it's going to take some real role playing this week to not want the magic thing that makes you not slack off.
[00:15:01]
Keith: This is the week where that sounds okay.
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: So I'm going to have to pretend…
Austin: So you're going to be… In other words, you would actually kind of like it if Motion took control of the Galaxy and gave us all endless…
Sylvi: No…
Austin: [overlapping] …wakefulness?
Keith: [overlapping] I… I would take a whiff!
Sylvi: [laughs]
Austin: [laughs]
Dre: Yeah, yeah.
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: Just stick your toe in the water.
Ali: Mm-hm.
Austin: A little… Uh-huh.
Sylvi: Someone to help me get through the week.
Dre: Hmm.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Motion's 5-Hour Energy…
Keith: [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] Motion definitely has some supplements at the gas station.
Sylvi: [overlapping] I’m just saying: Monster Energy logo would just work for Motion.
Austin: For Motion!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Motion Energy Drink!
Austin: [overlapping] It’s the same colors, even!
Keith: [laughs]
Austin: Damn! Shit! Call us!
Dre: [chuckles]
Keith: [overlapping] Call…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Bottoms up, and the devil laughs.
Keith: … the fucking other Divine! Pretend I knew it! pretend I knew what it was! Arbitrage. Strike up a deal with Arbitrage!
Austin: Just make it happen, yeah!
Keith: [overlapping] Get in all the gas stations.
Austin: I mean, listen! If you want to call Arbitrage I bet, you know, maybe Arbitrage will help you in this situation! Who could say!
Keith: No, no! Motion should call Arbitrage!
Austin: Oh, I see. I see.
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: To get a brand deal.
Austin: To get a… [overlapping] Right, right, right.
Dre: [overlapping] Uh-huh.
Sylvi: [overlapping] And while they're doing that we'll kill them.
Austin: [overlapping] Right. [chuckles]
Sylvi: [overlapping] While they're busy doing that… Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] While they're having the…
Sylvi: [overlapping] That's the plan.
Ali: [overlapping] Whoa…
Austin: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Dre: Yeah. [overlapping] They'll be stuck arguing residuals.
Sylvi: [overlapping] We need one of you to go undercover as a contestant on Motion’s Dragon Den.
Austin: Oh my god.
Sylvi: Uh…
Austin: Evil!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Motion’s Manor.
Austin: [overlapping] I do think Arbitrage is probably more… Yeah. Motion’s Manor is a good name, though.
Sylvi: Thank you.
Austin: Uh. So, yeah. Is this going to be just a… brawl? Does anyone…? Like, what are the…
Sylvi: Um…
Austin: What are the vibes at this point?
Sylvi: Like, in-character… I was going to ask some out-of-character…
Austin: Uh-huh!
Sylvi: … like, gameplay stuff?
Austin: Let’s be… If you’ve out-of-character gameplay questions we can add some some of those.
Dre: [overlapping] Hm.
Austin: [overlapping] And then I would love to get some in-character “moment before” type vibes, also.
Sylvi: [overlapping] My stuff is more like… strategically do we want to try and, like, divide up the different enemy combatants among different people? Like, assign responsibility to that stuff? Or, like.. Is the plan to… [sighs] take out the little guys around Motion while slowing Motion down? Or is it to just focus on the big bad. You know? And also are there other ideas.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] ‘Cause those are just the first two that came to mind.
Dre: Um… What that laser do?
Austin: [overlapping] I was about to drop an artillery icon, actually, on the… [chuckles]
Sylvi: [overlapping] Right! I forgot! It's been a while. I forgot we had the mega gun.
Keith: Yeah, what that laser do?
Austin: You do have the mega gun.
Dre: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: We got the doohickey.
Dre: [laughs]
Austin: You do got the…. the doohickey. It's true.
Sylvi: It's a giant one coming out of the ground.
Keith: It's a dooooo-hickey.
Austin: [chuckles]
Ali: [unimpressed] Whoa.
Austin: Damn.
Sylvi: You know.
Keith: [overlapping] It is so big!
Ali: [chuckles]
Sylvi: [overlapping] It is a bunch of Os.
Austin: Oh, okay!
Dre: [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Yea-yea-yeah.
Dre: The D's capitalized. I get it.
Austin: [chuckles tiredly] Uh-huh… Oh, this going to be gigantic isn't? It good. It's only… [chuckles]
Sylvi: Yeah, it's fine!
Dre: [chuckles]
Sylvi: It's fitting.
Austin: Yeah. I'll make it the regular size. And just put it on top of Earth. [overlapping] Here we go.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Is Motion bigger than… Is the Ekpyrosis bigger than Earth?
Austin: Um… No.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping]  I guess it isn't… Earth is far away.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Alright. Sure.
Austin: [overlapping] That's distance from you are. Yea-yea-yeah.
Dre: Yeah. That's to scale.
Austin: That's… Yeah. This is all to scale. Earth is a little far away.
Sylvi: It just popped into my head when I saw this. Like, “wait a minute!”
Austin: It’s very funny, though. Yeah. Uh… The Ekpyrosis is bigger than a Portcullis Gate, though.
Sylvi: Okay, cool.
Austin: Right? [overlapping] It could have not gotten here via Portcullis…
Sylvi: [overlapping] It’s… It’s a Death Star size.
Austin: Yes.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah. And… No. Again, big enough that its main gun can destroy a planet. Right?
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Which is the thing worth thinking about! Its main gun could just kill you all right now if it hit. Right?
Keith: In a KotOR 1[7] way or in a Star Wars way?
[someone breathes out in a semi-chuckling way]
Austin: [overlapping] Keith, those are two Star Wars things.
Keith: [overlapping] Like, A New Hope way is what I meant.
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: In A New Hope way.
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: Or like a Sun Crusher way…? Or…
Austin: [laughs]
Keith: [overlapping] That’s the same way!
Austin: [overlapping] In a Death Star-y… In a Death Star way.
Keith: [overlapping] In a Death Star way.
Austin: What we saw was it shot a planet from, you know, forever away. And then the planet kind of, like, tilted and gave way to its star’s gravity. And begin to fall into its own star.
Dre: Oh.
Keith: Okay.
Austin: Yeah. Like, so not instant… So it's not, not quite instant destruction…
Keith: [overlapping] Right.
Austin: [overlapping] …Death Star, all of Alderaan blows up. But it's not a KotOR 1 “it’s a fucking gun battle that lasts”—
Keith: [overlapping] Functionally, you'd rather be on Taris.
Austin: Oh. A hundred percent. Yeah.
Keith: Right.
Austin: Yea-yea-yeah. Yeah. Taris didn't fall into its sun's…
Keith: Right.
Austin: [overlapping] …you know, gravity well or something.
Keith: You could go back in 300 years and meet some rakghouls if you wanted.
Austin: You sure fucking can!
Keith: [laughs]
Austin: Somehow! You can go back there and learn that those people got it worse than you thought they even got it at the end of that questline.
Sylvi: Those ghouls have what now?
Keith: I… [overlapping] I always thought maybe they were fine.
Austin: [overlapping] Don’t worry about it. I thought they were fine, too! It turned out they were not fine, Keith.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah. Anyway.
Sylvi: [overlapping] That’s just sad.
Austin: [overlapping] Enough KotOR talk. [chuckles] Um.
Dre: [exaggerated] On this podcast?!?
Austin: [laughs] For now! For now. We'll come back around.
Keith: Shout out to the great KotOR 2 moment in the most recent episode of Media Club Plus.
Austin: Oooh! I'm excited. [overlapping] I’m excited to hear this.
Keith: [overlapping] Episode 24.
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, wait, is this the…
Keith: It's the one you were on!
Austin: … I was on. Yeah. [chuckles]
Dre: [laughs]
Austin: Yeah. Okay.
Sylvi: [overlapping] That’ll be out by the time this is out.
Austin: [overlapping] [with mock incredulity] There was a KotOR moment on the episode I was on?!? Wow!
Keith: Uh. We were talking about the… the black hole gravitational pull of Ging's charisma?
Austin: Oh, yeah. Sure. Which is what KotOR 2 is about.
Keith: Right.
Austin: Anyway!
Sylvi: [laughs]
Austin: [overlapping] Speaking of KotOR!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Now we're done with KotOR talk!
Austin: I mean, a potential question is… One potential big question for me is, like: “well, how do you even stop Motion at this point?” If Motion reconstituted herself inside of Jesset City, being — you know — from… by way of experimental Mech chassis that she wasn't even directly part of the creation of. Right? That was a thing Orion… Stel Orion made, just ‘cause they thought it was cool! [chuckles] And it happened to be a channel by which Motion could compel herself back into existence. And she's just in the fucking air! Is there a way to beat her directly in that way? Like, I don't… This is Austin big question mark mode. I don't know. Uh…
Janine: Yes.
Austin: I mean, the answer is yes. Right? The answer is yes we just have to find what that interesting thing is.
Sylvi: Mm-hm.
Austin: I don't know what that looks like. The second part…
Janine: What if we did an RNA vaccine, but instead of RNA and the thing that it does that I totally understand…
Austin: Yup. Mm-hm.
Janine: … it's those… it's, like, microscopic concrete hamburger seat belts?
Dre: Oh, nanomachines!
Austin: Wow! If we're going to wrap back around… It's changing the nanomachines to have the concrete hamburger seat belts in them already.
Janine: Mm-hm.
Dre: Hm.
Austin: That, by the way that episode just aired…
Janine: [chuckles]
Austin: … this past Sunday. The…
Janine: I know! [chuckles]
Austin: I was in chat, some…
Janine: [chuckles] At the Genesis of the…
Austin: Yes.
Janine: Yeah…
Austin: … the concrete hamburger seat belt Twilight Mirage episode just aired in the reairing of Twilight Mirage over on Twitch.
Ali: WoooW!
Austin: Which, by the way, every Sunday on Twitch we air a previous episode of the show. And right now we're kind of in the back half, the beginning back half of Twilight Mirage. So. It's been fun.
Janine: In the newsletter I try and, like… if there's, like, an extremely relevant thing that happens…
Austin: Hmm…!
Janine: … I try to… — that's, like, relevant to PALISADE and PARTIZAN — I try and shout that out.
Austin: That's Twilight Mirage! Uh. So, yeah. That's an interesting idea. Right? Is… Change the Perennial Wave in some way? Uh, Thisbe, you've been on that research and scientist grind. Obviously, Brnine, you are historically a kind of… I almost said a Megamind!
Keith: [laughs]
Sylvi: [overlapping] Ooohh!
Dre: [overlapping] Oohhh!
Janine: Oh, I just had an idea!
Ali: [overlapping] You know?
Keith: [overlapping] Brnine's a real Megamind type…!
Austin: Are you more of a Gru or more of a Megamind?
Sylvi: Damn, Brnine, why your forehead so big?
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: [chuckles]
Janine: Brnine, we got… we got to do a research project.
Ali: [overlapping] Sure! Right now?
Janine: [overlapping] I got an idea.
Austin: [laughs]
Dre: You start that clock, let's go!
Austin: [overlapping] Listen…!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Alright! We'll cover for you guys while you do scientific theory!
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: This is fun! This is a fun idea.
Janine: See, what if instead of… The thing is, what if instead of nanomachines — it was pollen?
Dre: [overlapping] Ohhh!
Ali: [overlapping] Oooh!
Keith: [unintelligible] Ooh.
Janine: [overlapping] What if it’s a…
Ali: [overlapping] What if it’s a sprayer?
Janine: What if we what if we invented some kind of space… Kudzu…
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Janine: … that would totally not be a problem in 10,000 years we come back to the setting again? That… [chuckles]
Keith: [overlapping] We'll spray them with Divinamotaceous Earth.[8]
Janine: [overlapping] … makes little… [chuckles] Oh, right. Uh-huh.
Ali: Hm?
Austin: Kudzu: National Invasive Species Information Center. Huh! Weird first hit!
Ali: [chuckles]
Janine: You can eat it, and it's supposed to be good! And I think it would be… I think it would be fixed if everyone just decided to start eating it.
Austin: I… You know. I have a lot of…
Ali: Yeah…
Austin: I have really complex feelings about the idea of invasive species: because I know on one hand that, like, yes invasive species, of course…
Janine: I thought you're going to say: “‘cause I know one.”
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Austin: I mean! Yeah, we all fucking do!
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: It's us! [chuckles] [overlapping] We’ve all been there.
Janine: [chuckles]
Dre: [overlapping] It’s us. Yeah.
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah. Yeah… True.
Austin: [overlapping] It's us, and anytime we decide something is, like, cool or cute, we decide that's fine, actually. This… It's fine if this is here.
Janine: Yeah…
Keith: Um…
Ali: Crush your lanternflies!
Austin: I mean, this is the thing! Is, like… I have a hard time killing them when they show up.
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Because I get it. I do get it! But also, history is the history of invasive species, and I don't mean just human history. I mean, biological history. It's…
Keith: [overlapping] Damn…
Austin: [overlapping] It's a little more complex, I think. And I think there's good research on this. Anyway! So I wanted to—
Keith: Second shout out to Media Club Plus! You should listen to Chimera Ants.
Austin: Yeah…! [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: [overlapping] Go listen to the Chimera Ant Arc!
Sylvi: [overlapping] I don’t get it. What’s the connection? I don't get it.
Austin: You know?
Keith: [chuckles]
Sylvi: That's just about weird bugs!
Austin: [chuckles] So, here's… So, one theory. One plan is emerging. And it's Brnine and Thisbe start cooking up some… a vaccine. A Motion vaccine.
Sylvi: Oh my god.
Keith: Emotion vaccine.
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Austin: Emotion… Emotion vaccine.
Dre: [overlapping] Man…
Sylvi: [overlapping] [gruffly] We need to cook, Thisbe!
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: I'm sorry, I… [chuckles]
Janine: [chuckles]
Dre: [laughs]
Janine: It's a fact that, like, every season some character has to really fuck up the world in a way that becomes the way [overlapping] the world is next time around.
Ali: [overlapping] Right.
Austin: [overlapping] Right. The literal seed in this case for what the next season would look like, in some way. Yeah!
Janine: Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] I'm here for it!
Ali: I’m going for a two-for.
Austin: Yeah. I like this plan. So then that looks like something is happening with Thisbe and Brnine… hanging out with the… back in the kind of Motion Power Center. You know, tinkering with the Perennial Wave while everybody else is running defense?
Keith: Sure.
Dre: Yeah?
Sylvi: Sure.
Keith: Best defense is a good offense.
Austin: [overlapping] I keep hearing this.
Ali: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Austin: Um… Who's going to point the big Earth gun from the front of the… what do you call it? The Blue Channel? If Brnine is doing science. [overlapping] And also, who’s…?
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah. That sounds like a Hunting thing. Right?
Austin: And… Yeah. And also who's going to be applying The Perennial Wave mister… [chuckles] that Brnine invented last time?
Sylvi: Uhh… Could we attach that to my mech, maybe? If I'm flying around?
Austin: [overlapping] You could!
Sylvi: [overlapping] I don't remember necessarily how the mister works.
Dre: I also don't remember how the mister works.
Austin: I… There were particular options given…
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: … to Brnine.
Dre: Oh, yeah!
Austin: You do not need to roll to spray it…
Keith: [overlapping] Or to refill.
Austin: [overlapping] … or to refill it.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: But a little less… [overlapping] It can only do 8 ticks…
Keith: [overlapping] There’s a smaller clip.
Austin: It's a smaller clip. Yeah. Exactly. So you can spend your turn…
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: … using it to decrease these clocks, basically.
Sylvi: Okay. Cool.
Austin: [overlapping] One-for-one.
Sylvi: [overlapping] That's what I wanted to know.
Austin: Yeah. Mm-hm.
Sylvi: I don't know if that's necessarily… Should that be my main deal? I was thinking I would be the front liner here just because that is kind of how Cori's built. Right? Is to be, like, in the mix, fighting?
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: But…
Austin: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: And I thought… For some reason I was like: “ah, yes! The mister! [half-chuckles] I can apply debuffs on my enemies with it!” [chuckles] For some reason!
Dre: [overlapping] Hm…!
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, no. Sorry. It's a healing…
Sylvi: It's a healing thing. Yeah. Yeah.
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: So I'm maybe not the best…
Dre: Maybe Levi takes it?
Austin: It could be! Yeah. I can imagine it, with Levi. [overlapping] Not my decision.
Dre: [overlapping] I mean, Levi is kind of built to be a support class. So…
Austin: True. Yeah. You also have that Cooling Off thing. Right?
Dre: Mm-hm. Yeah.
Austin: Yeah. Um, you don't have a name for the Star-Crossed ship, do you?
Dre: I don't! Or if I did, I’ve forgotten it. I don't think I did.
Austin: Nah, I don't think one came up. But, yeah. Um. Cool. So then… Then, let's say that you have it either on the ship, or… I mean, you can… You can wield a Tier 3 thing. Right?
Dre: Um, I don't know if it is I can wield, like, [overlapping] just any Tier 3 thing.
Austin: [overlapping] Ohh! You can just wield your Tier 3 thing.
Dre: Yeah. [overlapping] I think so.
Austin: [overlapping] That makes sense. So maybe it's on the ship.
Dre: Yeah. That makes sense. Ehh… Cool! It feels like we kind of have our vibe! And then I guess the Blue Channel will be Hunting — which you can use with the Crew score. But you can only use it the amount of times you can use it, then. Because you're not at the helm, Brnine. And I'm not saying this to get rid of this plan! I'm just noting that that's an interesting element here. Right? Is that the… the party can roll the Crew score up to the amount of times there is the Crew score — which I think is 3. So… So you'll get three rolls without needing to put some… without needing to put a player character at the helm of that thing.
Keith: Theoretically, Brnine could return to the ship?
Austin: Absolutely.
Keith: Got it.
Austin: Yep. And, you know, it's one of those things that's funny because it's like: “well, why wouldn't hunting do it without…” like… “what's the fiction of players can only roll the Crew score three times?” And I think the actual answer is… You know. It becomes more of, like, a fate roll at that point which is much… much riskier. You don't get to roll +3 anymore. It becomes probably a +0 roll. You know? Um… If it was something that Hunting was doing we just wanted to see if it worked. You know? Um. Alright. You should have control of these little tokens, still. Uh… and so feel free to move stuff around, I guess… before we hit the go button. I'm going to put the Blue Channel, the Third Opus — which is KO Rook's crew — towards the front. Um… And the Stolen Cameo, likewise. And… But, but. You know? You tell me. I guess, Leap are you… Here's a question I've actually had…
Keith: Mm-hm.
Austin: … is your tank…? you have a tank. But you don't have a spaceship with you here. You just came on the blue channel. Right?
Keith: I came on the Blue Channel. Yes.
Austin: Okay. And the… Precipice is not a tank/spaceship.
Keith: No. It does not have boosters or anything — that is a tag that you could get for it.
Austin: You could get. Right. Yeah. Okay. Cool.
Keith: Pretty sure… Pretty sure there's an aerial tag in one of these moves.
Austin: Levi, I'm moving you up to where Mow is, and I'm making sure you can control the Star-Crossed ship. So you can move that around as you want. I'm going to get rid of this Ekpyrosis arrival clock. I'm going to move it up, I guess. Maybe I'll… It'll just get closer. You know? But it's basically… It's not here. It's not on land. You know? But it's on the map! So… We're kind of there. Are there any other things, any other conversations? Any other… Like, we take a beat here. You know? People aren't… The red alarm hasn't hasn't gone off yet. Or the Red Alert alarm hasn't gone off yet. Is there anything anyone wants to do before we kick it off?
Keith: Uh… No. I'm assuming that I'm just starting in the tank with everybody…?
Sylvi: I can get my sickles back, right?
Austin: Yeah. You've gotten your sickles back.
Sylvi: Cool. [chuckles]
Austin: Yeah. And also anybody who has Risks can clear those Risks.
Dre: [overlapping] Ooowh!
Austin: [overlapping] I don't know about…
Sylvi: I didn't have any! [chuckles] That's crazy!
Austin: Y'all…
Keith: Same.
Austin: … like, cleaned up that first phase of this fight.
Ali: [chuckles]
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: In such a way that's, like… was great. You know? [overlapping] Loved that.
Dre: [overlapping] Hmm!
Sylvi: [overlapping] People’re going to think we were savescumming.
Austin: [chuckles] Uh-huh…!
Keith: There was a moment where I really thought that the inside of that building was gonna go bad.
Austin: It looked like it was rough for a second. [overlapping] But you pulled it out!
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] There’s definite… I think… The threat from last time felt way more, like, the… Motion stuff getting to Cas, then.
Austin: [overlapping] Yep. Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah…
Sylvi: Any of us being in mortal danger? Not necessarily.
Keith: Yeah. I'll say this…
[00:30:00]
Keith: … it took three uses of Bardic Inspiration and two uses of the Retrograde hold…
Austin: Right.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Keith: … to make that happen. And most of those Retrograde were spent giving more rolls to Bardic Inspiration! [chuckles]
Austin: [chuckles]
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: Well, yeah. It's a thing of, like… Where are your resources spent during a long encounter. [overlapping] Which is kind of what doing. Right? So.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah. Yeah.
Austin: So, yeah.
Dre: Um… We can clear Risks, but not Perils?
Austin: But not Perils. No.
Dre: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] I don't think you had the time to deal with, for instance, Levi’s “self-doubt”.
Dre: I don’t know! I did some cool stuff!
Austin: You did some cool stuff! But I think it's still gnawing at you.
Keith: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah. Especially when, you know, the big fucking bad spaceship fleet shows up.
Austin: Right! Well. And the thing that… I think is loud and Levi's head is… the conversation that you had with Jesset back on Palisade. Right?
Dre: Hm.
Austin: Which has been echoed by the return of Motion, who — as a reminder — has kind of been whispering in everyone's ears about why you need her in some way. Or why you should give yourself over to this impulse. Um… And for you, Levi, it's that you will need her. That, you know, you're surrounded by all these people who have been battered up and bruised by committing themselves to this fight. Look at someone like Cori — who it was not a long time ago that Cori was, like, the naive and almost petulant… [half-chuckles] you know… [overlapping] poster-girl…
Sylvi: [overlapping] [exaggeratedly] What are you talking about?!?
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. Almost…?
Austin: And… [laughs]
Keith: [laughs]
Dre: Damn.
Austin: And now it's… You know? Grizzled Cori hours.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: And…
Sylvi: Grrr…
Austin: … you've seen that. Right? [chuckles]
Sylvi: What? Grr.
Dre: Grizzly bear Cori hour. [chuckles]
Sylvi: Rightrr…
Austin: “Cori with a cigarette behind her ear” hours. You know?
Sylvi: Yeah. I learned all about smoking from Eclectic!
Austin: [laughs] And now… So, like, I think that that's the angle that Motion has taken with you for sure — is like: “you don't have what you need to do the things that you want to do, and”... It's the thing Keith joked about earlier! Maybe it’d be nice to have just a little… just a whiff of this energy…
Keith: Hm…
Austin: … that's being offered to you. You know? Um. Yeah. Alright. If there's not anything else, we can get moving.
Cori’s scene [00:32:05]
Keith: [overlapping] Time to shoot.
Austin: [overlapping] Who’s out front? Who's the… Who leads this charge?
Sylvi: I feel… You know.
Austin: [overlapping] It’s Cori…
Sylvi: [overlapping] That's the type of thing I’d volunteer for. Yeah.
Austin: Alright. Go ahead and put yourself out there. I think it's…
Sylvi: “Cori, you've really got start putting yourself out there more!”
Austin: [chuckles]
Sylvi: “I know it's been a while since Elle left, but…”
Austin: Incredible! Yeah! Uh-huh. Um…
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah. So, Cori, as you… you know, drive forward here, I think the Divine Valour is the one that's charging out to meet you. You know? Present hovering in the background as a sort of, you know, ominous presence. You've been chased by Present for so long. But between her and you… is this Divine — which, as a reminder Valour is not… a particularly large um machine. It's the size of an altar, and it can kind of transform between this kind of… roc. You know. Eagle Roc. R-O-C roc, not R-O-C-K.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: R-O-C roc, like, kind of bird form and then, like, a more traditional humanoid Mecha. Um… And, you know, as you approach… Obviously, this is not just Valour. But it is also zig's kind of core crew of… most loyal soldiers. And I think… you know, you get to kind of… zig moves kind of clousoush… [stumbles with words] Hm. Close-ish towards you. And then halts and his crew — you know, his loyal soldiers — kind of take formation above and below and behind and around. And then you get a… kind of a call from zig.
Sylvi: [sighs]
Sylvi (as Coriolis Sunset): Yeah?
Austin (as Zig’ell Barbos AKA Xiphion): [sighs] I've heard of what you've accomplished. And… I'm honored to fight you. Do you want to handle this one-on-one?
Coriolis Sunset: It seems easier.
Zig’ell Barbos AKA Xiphion: Alright.
Austin: Comms off, dashes forward in a burst of uh red hot energy.
Sylvi: I'm meeting ‘em.
Austin: Alright. You're going to have to… immediately…
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: … as you enter into kind of melee range…
Sylvi: Mm-hm.
Austin: … I need you to simply make a Weather The Storm.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] A Weather the Storm Defy for being in the presence of the kind of overwhelming aura of the Divine Valour.
Keith: Um. I have a question about these three Divines.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Keith: How many of them are… killable? As in pre-Gumption Divines?
Austin: Hm-mm…! I don't think any of them are pre-Gumption.
Keith: That's what I thought.
Sylvi: I rolled a 9. [overlapping] A 1 and a 6 and +2.
Keith: [overlapping] I thought maybe Present. But I couldn't remember where Present came from.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah, I don't think Present… These are all… Because Motion and Present were invented, effectively, for the… the Pact.
Keith: Right.
Austin: And Valour is also… came about via the worldbuilding for… PARTIZAN, basically. Sorry. You got a 9, Silvi!
Sylvi: Yeah. [overlapping] Partial success.
Austin: [overlapping] Alright. A partial success on Weather The Storm says “you succeed, but at some cost: it'll keep you occupied longer than you thought, the Director will ask you to make a difficult choice, or you'll burn a point of Spotlight as you take dramatic action.” Um. You are on the back foot.
Sylvi: Mm-hm.
Austin: This is… Instantly, like, you feel: “okay, Valour is a…” You know. “...and Xiphion/Zig…”
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] “…this is a harder person than you've ever fought before in terms of meeting your moves.” Right? Your sickles are coming out and they're being blocked. You’re on the back foot — you're going to need to continue to Weather The Storm until you get a Full Success before you can take a swing at Valour.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Alright.
Keith: [overlapping] Damn.
Austin: [overlapping] You don't take any negatives here. But that's, like, the state of this.
Sylvi: Yeah. I'm locked in… [chuckles]
Austin: Yeah…
Sylvi: To go back to KotOR, I'm doing my idle little…
Austin: Yeah! [overlapping] Uh-huh.
Keith: [chuckles]
Sylvi: [overlapping] … basic attack animation over and over again.
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: Exactly. Yes.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: Um… Let's swing back over to people who are going on the offensive here: Leap…
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Or… Why am I blanking on… Levi's name? Leap or Levi?
Leap’s turn [00:35:46]
Keith: I would love to try and get some of these… little large gangs.
Austin: Yeah. Are you… What are you piloting, or what are you in? [overlapping] Are you in the Blue Channel?
Keith: [overlapping] I’m in the tank.
Austin: Okay. So you're just going to sit on the edge of the thing, kind of snipe out?
Keith: Yeah. I figured that's, like… It's a low stakes way to get rid of some of these numbers on the screen.
Austin: Yeah. Totally. I'm going to move these big… these big gangs forward.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Um… You know. They got to get within range of you is the one negative of this.
Keith: Mm-hm. I have sniper range. But…
Austin: You do. You do. But it's…
Keith: [overlapping] We’re in space.
Austin: [overlapping] You know, we talked about… sniper range is… We are in space. I guess that's an important… important thing.
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: I've pulled Pact #2 and Pact #5 forward.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: These are… These are smaller units. And they are primarily… like, traditional spaceship-style fighters.
Keith: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Austin: [overlapping] Which is not a thing we do a lot of here. Um… There are two of them coming forward. One from the kind of north and one from the south — which I know are weird terms here out in space, but you know what the fuck I mean.
Keith: [overlapping] Space north!
Austin: Space north.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: I think space north… for where we are is just, like, [overlapping] towards the galactic core instead of away from the galactic core.
Keith: [overlapping] Right. Yeah.
Austin: For where we are. So, yeah. Are you going to take a shot at one of these kind of fighter units?
Keith: Yeah. Let me get Pact 2!
Austin: Alright. Give me a… an Exchange Blows!
Keith: Okay. And I'm using… Let's see. I have to slightly remind myself… Actually…!
Austin: Hm.
Keith: Let me just take a double look ‘cause I have “messy” or… “area”. Area!
Austin: Sure.
Keith: Is what I have.
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: Um. And then… so I want to look and see [overlapping] if there’s anything…
Austin: [overlapping] Well, interestingly, that almost… You know. I said before: you basically have your own small gang with you.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: But interestingly enough that would make you alone, like, your crew alone useful against these big gangs because you're firing “area” weapons at them. You know?
Keith: Yeah. That's what I'm thinking of. Is…
Austin: Yup.
Keith: ‘Cause I was going to hit Pact 2. But maybe it's better to hit someone that's close to another… But since they're already gangs, [overlapping] I guess it doesn’t matter. Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] They're already gangs. These are each representing bigger things.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: And I think really what it is… You know… The attacking at a distance like this, you know, you are alone or it's you and your crew in your tank firing. Right?
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Um. Which would actually put you at Disadvantage, normally. But between “area” and the fact that there's 12 of you you are equaled up. You know?
Keith: Okay. [overlapping] And so…
Austin: [overlapping] The big–small gang differential has been equalled out. You know?
Keith: When it says “gain Advantage when you would benefit from your Scale”, technically I've got the “area” weapon. But also the team here. [overlapping] Is that tipping me into Advantage?
Austin: [overlapping] Uh, yeah. I’ll push that… that will equal you first with “area”.
Keith: [overlapping] Right.
Austin: [overlapping] And then it'll push you into… into Advantage. ‘Cause it's, specifically, if I'm remembering right, your whole team gets those…
Keith: Yes.
Austin: [overlapping] … those traits. Right?
Keith: [overlapping] The whole team. Yeah.
Austin: Gets those… Yeah. Alright. So, yeah. Give me…
Keith: So it's 3d6+3?
Austin: 3d6+3… is that what your…
Keith: Oh, 2. +2.
Austin: [overlapping] What’s your…
Keith: [overlapping] Oh, 2. 2, 2, 2.
Austin: Yeah. Your Clash is 2. Right?
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: 3d6+2. Uh… [overlapping] That’s 12.
Keith: [overlapping] Uh, that's 12.
Austin: That is a full hit. Are you going to give a Risk… and stay safe or you going to give a Peril and take a Risk?
Keith: Uhhh… This is the… This is the first… [chuckles]
Austin: Mm-hm.
Keith: [half-chuckles] This is the first… This beginning of the fight! [overlapping] I'm gonna give a Risk.
Austin: [overlapping] You’re gonna give a Risk. Okay. Yeah. So I think that the Risk is very simple. This Risk is just, like… “under fire” or “pinned down” or…
Keith: Mm-hm.
Austin: You know. Basically, like, it's being forced to to fly evasively. You know? Um… I'm gonna say “under fire”, as it continues to try to zero in on y'all. But it is Defenseless now! So someone else could knock it out as it kind of comes in for a strafing run. And by it, again it's like a unit of fighters that are now kind of, like…
Keith: [overlapping] Right.
Austin: [overlapping] Maybe that's the way about the Risk…
Keith: These are the Galaga guys that swoop down.
Austin: That swoop down. But they're…
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: The Risk they're taking is “out of formation”. It's almost, like, you're firing flak cannon fire into the sky.
Sylvi: Ohhh…!
Austin: You know?
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] So, like, they can’t be their fun defensive — which, as a reminder, the Apostolosian stuff all works better when they're in formation. Right? So…
Keith: Mm-hm.
Austin: Or they're, like, near each other.
Levi’s scene [00:39:56]
Austin: And let's swing over — fuck it — to Levi. Levi and the Star-Crossed ship…
Dre: Sure.
Austin: Where do y'all… Where are yall… What are y'all doing?
Dre: Okay. I can think of two actions here.
Austin: Yep.
Dre: Either to finish off this squadron that… Leap has started taking out. Is there anything I can do to assist Cori with her current, like, status?
Austin: The answer is, of course, yes.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] But it would immediately turn everything into… I mean, it depends on what you're trying to do. What do you… What would you… The thing that I was going to say is, like: if you get involved directly it will turn into the big melee that it currently isn't.
Sylvi: Yeah…
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Because it's a duel, instead.
Dre: Yea-yea-yeah.
Austin: If you're trying to do something that is, like, help Cori break out of the… sort of the back foot that she's in by doing some other sort of… you know… helping emotionally? Then that's possible.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah. Also does Cori even want help in this situation?
Sylvi: [overlapping] That was what I was going to say — is, in-character, I do not think Cori wants someone interfering with this…
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] … if it's supposed to be one-on-one.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: Especially, given the pretense of we're doing this so the soldiers around us don't fight each other, too.
Austin: Right.
Dre: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: Um… So… Emotional support? Sure!
Dre: [laughs]
Sylvi: But… that's it.
Dre: That's it. Yeah. Okay. Um… Then, yeah. I will… take out this other Pact group that's out of formation.
Austin: Alright. That sounds, like, a… the one where you kill people. Strike Decisively.
Ali: [chuckles]
Sylvi: [laughs]
Dre: [chuckles] [overlapping] You know, that one!
Austin: [overlapping] You know? We've been playing this game for a year! You would think we would know all Moves, but…
Sylvi: [overlapping] My favorite American Football song.
Dre: Uh-huh.
Austin: [laughs]
Dre: Uh-huh. Yeah.
Austin: So, yeah. Strike Decisively. That's that is uh 2d6 plus your Clash…
Dre: Mm-hm.
Austin: Which, I think, is 1.
Dre: Which is 1.
Austin: 2d6+1
Dre: Pwoopf!
Austin: Yikes!
Dre: We're starting off hot here, folks.
Austin: Alright. 2 plus 1 plus is a 4. That’s…
Keith: That's low.
Austin: That's low.
Keith: [overlapping] That’s low.
Austin: [overlapping] Do you… Do you want help? Do you want to… And I guess a way, I don't… The help would have to come from someone who isn't already involved in this fight…!
Dre: Yea-yea-yeah.
Austin: Just kind of be Cori, Thisbe or Brnine. I think everyone there is engaged, currently. Or! I guess, Hunting… theoretically. Or. You know. I guess what I'd say is you can use that Crew roll on any of your allies so that includes the Third Opus, it includes the Stolen Cameo, includes the Mosaic True, [overlapping] includes the Blue Channel.
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: Or! You could use Retrograde.
Dre: Yeah. I still have two charges of Retrograde. So… I'm okay using that.
Austin: [overlapping] Alright.
Dre: [overlapping] I'll go and burn one of those.
Austin: Alright. Burn one of those. And then… Let's make sure we know what you're looking for here because you would need at least a 4 in order to get a mixed success here. Right?
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] That’s not… That’s 50-50.
Dre: [overlapping] That's, like, a 50-50 shot. Yea-yea-yeah.
Austin: Alright. Burn it!
Dre: Oh! Do I… Would I refresh… I should have asked this earlier. [overlapping] Would I refresh, like, my Mobility charges?
Austin: [overlapping] No, this is the same Sortie as before.
Dre: [overlapping] Okay. I didn’t think so. Yeah, that's what I thought.
Austin: I mean, explicitly… [somewhat exaggeratedly] To meld narrative and mechanics, as I like to do here…
Dre: Mm-hm.
Austin: This is kind of what I was signaling out when I said Motion has prevented you from resting. Right?
Dre: Yeah. [overlapping] For sure.
Austin: [overlapping] This is why Risks have cleared, but Perils you couldn't. You didn't get that sort of, like… [sighs in relief] “Hooh. Okay. Let's get ready for the next thing. Let me get my Mobility charges back!” Tu-du-du-du-du-du-duh.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] You couldn't find that, and normally you might have been able to. Even with only 90 minutes.
Dre: We're not all sprinting to, like, reload the guns and recharge the shields. But we're also not walking leisurely either.
Austin: Right! Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.
Dre: Okay.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Everybody’s speedwalking! [chuckles]
Dre: [overlapping] Well, let's see how this goes! [groans]
Austin: [groans] Oh! [overlapping] 3 + 2 + 1 is 6, unfortunately!
Dre: [overlapping] 6!
Keith: [overlapping] Yikes.
Sylvi: [overlapping] I did not not see the roll at first and I thought that was just a reaction to the speedwalking comment…!
Austin: [laughs]
Sylvi: Like: “oh, they really hated that one, damn!”
Dre: [groans]
Austin: [mock-groans]
Sylvi: [overlapping] Alright. Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] Next you’re gonna tell me you’re doing [inaudible] at the mall!
Austin: [overlapping] Listen, Silvi…!
Sylvi: I'll keep it down!
Austin: Hit the fucking bricks! We're done with you and your bullshit!
Dre: [chuckles]
Sylvi: [from a distance] Bye! Bye!
Keith: Pitou Bricks.
Austin: [laughs]
Dre: [chuckles] Pitou Bricks!
Sylvi: [from a distance] Bye!
Austin: Pitou Bricks. Um…! What… What was I going to say? I was going to say…
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Austin: I was going to say: we should take… I'm going to take a break here for a second. What is… Because I have to remember something.
Dre: Yea-yea-yeah.
Austin: You are, of course, Mundane. Right? You're firing Mundane weapons and stuff? ‘Cause I did not think about if this would have come into… [overlapping] effect.
Dre: [overlapping] Ohhh! Yes.
Austin: Against this stuff, at all, for even a second. Um. I don't think it does for either you or for Leap. [overlapping] But I’ll double-check.
Keith: [overlapping] I am… Divine. No.
Austin: [overlapping] You are Divine. No, are you?
Keith: [overlapping] Wait, what am I?
Austin: [overlapping] You're not Divine! Leap?!?
Keith: No, it… It's the tank. The tank has its own thing.
Dre: [overlapping] Ohhh!
Austin: [overlapping] what’s that?
Keith: And I think it's Divine…
Austin: You su…
Keith: [overlapping] It’s…
Austin: [overlapping] I must have written it down. Why would it be Divine? What's the Divine stuff?
Keith: [overlapping] It’s…
Austin: [overlapping] Where or what about it is Divine?
Keith: It is just what the tank that it makes me take is.
Austin: No. Well… But what is narratively…
Keith: I would love to double-check that that's true by opening the book [overlapping] and just looking at the tank ardent.
Austin: [overlapping] Okay. While you do that, I'm going to say…
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: … playing forward… that in this particular instance… for Levi: Levi, you're Mundane.
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: The Apostolisian stuff here is Elemental. That has not… That does not come into effect.
[00:45:01]
Austin: Like, there's no… There's no intersection there.
Keith: Ah! Arcane.
Austin: Yeah. That makes more sense to me. Yeah. So that doesn't… that makes perfect sense. Arcane makes perfect Sense for what the tank would be. It runs on Kalmeria stuff. Arcane tends to be that. Um… And so that would not have come into effect in this particular instance.
A brief return to Cori’s scene [00:45:19]
Austin: Um… uh though it… we'll come back around to a second! Because Cori, it will affect you.
Sylvi: Yeah!
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: You're profane and you're fighting…
Sylvi: Yeah…
Austin: Oh, wait. Ooh, it goes the other way for you, huh? Unfortunately.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Well…
Austin: [overlapping] You're fighting Divine
[pause]
Sylvi: [overlapping] I got things I can do.
Austin: [overlapping] We’ll come back.
Sylvi: [overlapping] I got things I can do.
Austin: [overlapping] You do have things you can do. We can talk about that. 
Returning to Levi’s scene [00:45:40]
But, yeah. So, Levi Mundane versus… Elemental is actually worse for you now that I'm looking at it. [overlapping] Unfortunately.
Dre: [overlapping] Siiick!
Austin: And you don't have a way of changing your stuff. Right?
Dre: No. There is a Scout move that lets you do that. But I didn't take it.
Austin: You didn't take it. Alright. Well…! I think, unfortunately, you have failed this Strike Decisively here.
Dre: Yeah…
Austin: What goes wrong? What is the… What do you… What is your attack attempt here? What is the thing that we see you attempt to do?
Dre: Oohhhh…
Austin: Are you out of the ship, at this point? [overlapping] Are you using the ship weapons?
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: Okay.
Dre: No. I think that's… What we've seen of Levi the most, like, honest to the fiction is that Levi is, like, is out of the ship.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Dre: Um…
Austin: Is it you with your whole jumparound crew out of the ship? Or is the ship just backing you up as, like, a… Is the ship your unit…
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Or do you have a bunch of other jumparound bois? [chuckles] Levi and the jumparound bois?
Dre: [laughs]
Keith: [laughs] [overlapping] God, how did we not…?
Dre: [overlapping] [in a midcentury TV announcer voice] This week on Ed Sullivan Show: Levi and the Jumparound Bois!
Austin: [chuckles]
Sylvi: [laughs]
Keith: How do we not land on this sooner?
Austin: Umm!
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: I don't know.
Sylvi: I was thinking Crisscross not… [chuckles] not Ed Sullivan!
Austin: [chuckles]
Dre: Well… You know.
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Keith: It does… It does sound old-timey.
Dre: [overlapping] [chuckles] It does!
Austin: [overlapping] It does.
Dre: Um. Honestly, what I think happens is that… maybe I, like — again, fictionally — I take out one of the ships…
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] … and I go to, like, ping pong to the next one.
Austin: Hmm!
Dre: And I just fucking miss it!
Austin: Hm. Hm.
Dre: And I'm flipping through space.
Austin: The thing that I think happens that you are surprised by…
Dre: Mm-hm.
Austin: … is that you're not the only one with gravity powers out here.
Dre: Oouhh!
Austin: These ships that have been blessed by Motion also have… or have been designed, you know, whatever… the element that they're controlling is gravity. And so you try to jump away from one that you've stabbed into. And you don't get to jump away. And it blows up.
Dre: Hmmm…
Austin: You know… while you're still connected to it. I think you have to take a Peril here, [overlapping] on a hard fail…
Dre: [overlapping] Sure.
Austin: … on a Strike Decisively. You take the… Take the Peril… “blown up”...
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: Take the Peril… what's a good explode… what's a good “you've been…” there's been… There’s been an explosion and your armor only helped you survive [overlapping] some of it?
Dre: [overlapping] “Scorched”?
Austin: “Scorched”. Oh, yeah! That's a classic Dre…
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah…!
Austin: [overlapping] … Dre one. Go ahead and take “scorched” as a Peril. And you kind of go flinging away from that one, unfortunately. And, yeah. It has not been Struck Decisively against. You know. And as you do that I think we see the… I guess, the Stolen Cameo… None of these people, like, really know-you know you. But the Mosaic True kind of comes in to support you and try to engage that ship at this point.
Brnine & Thisbe’s scene [00:48:22]
Austin: Let's go to Thisbe and Brnine! What's the research like? What's the… What's the big plan?
Dre: [chuckles]
[pause]
Janine: I think I have to introduce Brnine to my plant.
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: I wanted nothing more than this.
Dre: Yeah.
Ali: Alright. “Hello.”
Janine: [overlapping] So… [chuckles]
Sylvi: [overlapping] They're fucking hot boxing the Blue Channel right now?
Ali: [chuckles]
Janine: Hmm…!
Dre: [overlapping] No, that’s the Hieron plant.
Janine: [overlapping] I think Thisbe’s little ship is probably, like… [chuckles] I think Thisbe’s ship is probably docked in Blue Channel — is probably small enough to be in there.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Janine: So, yeah. I think… I think Thisbe, like, shows Brnine into this… very small room that is dominated by this very weird grafted up… plant. I think the plant I said it was, like, a clematis. Right? [overlapping] The one with, like, a bunch of star-shaped flowers?
Austin: [overlapping] The star-shapes. Yeah. Uh-huh.
Janine:  And they're all, like, sort of different colors and different degrees of star-shapedness. And it's clear, it's just, like… It's truly just, like, maybe two dozen different plants — like, wildly different plants — attached to each other with, like, weird little… Like, there's wooden bits. There's vine-y bits. Like, it's weird. And… I think Thisbe just says:
Janine (as Thisbe): I've been working on this.
Janine: [chuckles]
Keith: [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Explosions rock the ship from outside…! Everything…
Keith: Canonically, stunned, let's say!
Austin: [laughs]
Ali: [laughs] Uhhh…
Janine: I'm just imagining Thisbe, like.. Sending Brnine a message, like:
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah!
Thisbe: I need you to meet me at my ship, immediately.
Janine: [chuckles] Like, showing them in and being, like: “this.”
Ali (as Kalvin Brnine): G… Great. Um… Is it… You think this is gonna help?
Thisbe: It has… certain properties of Divinity. I've been attempting to…
Janine: I don't want to say create. Um…
Thisbe: I've… I've been attempting to… develop the organic Divine.
Kalvin Brnine: Organic!
Sylvi: [laughs]
Kalvin Brnine: Cool!
Sylvi: [exaggeratedly] Wire!
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: GMO-free!
Austin: [laughs] I was gonna say, Brnine at the Whole Foods…!
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: “Organic! Cool!”
Dre: [chuckles]
Thisbe: There are many… There are many properties of plants…
Janine: [chuckles]
Thisbe: … that could… be beneficial to us in ways to combat something as… fine and… miasmatic as Motion. [overlapping] And Kalmeria.
Kalvin Brnine: [overlapping] Miasmatic. Right. Right. Um… I… You know, Thisbe, I'm ready to help! But… I… The situation is a little time-sensitive, I think.
Janine: [chuckles]
Thisbe: Some of… some of these plants are from environments that have no atmosphere, and they are still able to propagate. And sometimes they propagate across space. And if we could take advantage of that, accelerate that, and attach something to that — then it might be… a useful tool. Because we can't… We cannot shoot Motion. We cannot destroy it in a way that we recognize that is meaningful.
Kalvin Brnine: I was really hoping we'd shoot it.
Sylvi: [laughs]
Austin: [laughs]
Thisbe: Do you remember the device we used on Ebullience?
Ali: Um. Yeah, that hamburger thing. Right?
Thisbe: Yes.
Ali: [chuckles]
Dre: Hell yeah, dude.
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: [laughs]
Janine: [overlapping] A concrete hamburger restraint device.
Austin: [overlapping] A world where everyone just… Right! Yeah. Everyone, just immediately…
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: … intuitively, in this universe, gets it.
Keith: [chuckles]
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Austin: Unlike our universe everyone has closed minds and no imagination!
Keith: [laughs]
Janine: [laughs]
Austin: And look at me weird!
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: Obviously, it's more like a hot dog.
Austin: [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Janine: [chuckles]
Keith: One piece slides into the other piece. Like a hot dog.
Austin: Oh, yeah. Of course.
Dre: Is a concrete hamburger restraining device a sandwich?
Austin: Oh fuck off!
Dre: [chuckles]
Thisbe: We have the tools to propagate things. And we have the tools to, theoretically, restrain things. But I do not know how to combine them. It would take me a long time to figure it out on my own.
Kalvin Brnine: Okay. Well…! Right. Um… Well, we know what hurts Motion, and… Do you think we have enough of this plant stuff… to do this?
Janine: Hey here's a question!
Austin: Mm-hm.
Ali: [chuckles]
Janine: Is the plant affected by Motion?
Austin: Um… I…
Dre: Oh, shit…!
Austin: … think that the plant is probably below Motion’s, like…
Janine: [disappointed] Owh. I was hoping we could Motion against Motion.
Austin: Oh. Sorry. Yeah.
Janine: I guess I could use Ebullience somehow!
Austin: Well… Sorry.
Janine: [overlapping] There might already be…
Austin: [overlapping] I actually thought you doing something else entirely different, actually. But let's…
Janine: Oh, no. I wanted to make the plant, like, do stuff fast.
Austin: Do stuff fast…
Dre: Mm-hm.
Ali: Ohhh!
Austin: [overlapping] Let me…
Janine: [overlapping] It could make pollen fast.
Austin: Right.
Janine: [overlapping] Lifecycles. You know?
Austin: [overlapping] I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying. You're saying: “can we do the…” You could… [overlapping] on your weird plant…
Janine: [overlapping] I want to hit fast forward on my weird plant.
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Austin: I see.
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] And make it grow fast I thought you were… Okay. So the thing that I thought you were doing was, like… putting the plant into the Perennial Wave…
Ali: Yeah…
Austin: Because you said the vaccine. That's why I was thinking of this. Right? I was like: [overlapping] “Oh, you're going to, like, inject the plant into the vet…”
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: But the thing that you're now saying makes me think of, like: “Oh, you're going to put it in a lab and then Motion-blast it to…” [chuckles]
Sylvi: [chuckles] Yeah?
Austin: Which is, like, Flavor-blasting.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah, yeah! It's exactly what I thought!
Dre: [overlapping] Yea-yea-yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] It’s like Flavor-blasting… Yeah. That's what we all thought! You're gonna Motion-blast…
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] … it to make it grow really quick.
Sylvi: [overlapping] [half-chuckles] This is what I thought! Wait!
Austin: Okay.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Why'd you say it like that?
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah.
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: It's fine. So, to me those are, like, two different ideas. I'm happy with either of them. But it's, like… One of them…
Janine: Well, I mean, I think one kind of precedes the other.
Austin: Okay. Which is…?
Janine: ‘Cause, like, you make it grow and then it can, like, release its pollen or whatever. And then you engineer the pollen.
Austin: And then you engineer… And then you feed the pollen into the…
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah… I thought…
Austin: [overlapping] … the Perennial Wave.
Janine: [overlapping] Into space.
Ali: I thought we were Perennial Wave vacuuming it, and then spreading it out.
Austin: I thought we were, like…
Janine: That also… [overlapping] works. I don’t know!
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. I thought we were, like, genetically blending the Perennial Wave — or not genetically — but we were, like, tinkering with the Perennial Wave to turn it into… to introduce this thing that would then grow… I do think these are the elements. Whatever… I think these are the three…
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: The three steps should be the things that we've laid out. Which is: Step One. You have the plant. Step… And problem: you only have a little bit of the plant. The plant isn't enough to do anything big. Step… So you need more of it somehow.
Janine: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Keith: [overlapping] Step Two: show the plant to Brnine.
Austin: Step Two… And even that, like: boom! Nailed it.
[others laugh]
Austin: Absolutely crushed that step. [overlapping] No rolls needed. That’s all… Poor…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Stuck the landing.
Austin: Pure role-play. Perfectly. Not poor, pure role-play. We got that one. Three… get either more… get more of it and make it spread faster — which, I think, can either be done through the Perennial Wave or through getting the Motion, like, energy into it. I do like that, conceptually. I like turning that against her and it's really fun. So…
Keith: Damn, we were already talking about kudzu!
Austin: Exactly. Right. Um. But then… And then… Yeah. It does seem like the final thing would have to be spreading it through the Perennial Wave. Because Motion is everywhere in the Galaxy. That would effectively push her out. Right? It would spread…
Janine: Oh, I have… [overlapping] Yes. Sorry.
Austin: [overlapping] Go. Yes. Run.
Janine: Sorry, we're gonna… Sorry, the thing is to push her out of the Galaxy? [overlapping] Into other Galaxies?
Austin: [overlapping] No, no, no. To…
Janine: [chuckles]
Austin: To overwrite her [overlapping] in the Perennial Wave.
Ali: [overlapping] Dilute her such that she is destroyed. Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Is destroyed. Via the kudzu. Via the clematis-kudzu. Right? That, like, right now… Here's… Oh boy! We're going to do fake science! Get ready!
Ali: Oohhh!
Dre: Hmm!
Austin: Alright. [clears his throat] Very important drawing about to be on screen.
Janine: Mm-hm. [overlapping] Uh-huh.
Dre: [overlapping] Ohh!
Austin: [overlapping] This big white orb is… There's one Kalmeria. Right?
Janine: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] Um. Obviously. We can all see that. That's… I've drawn a circle of, like, a filled-in white circle. And it used to be that this whole thing was Perennial Wave! However!
Janine: Yay!
Austin: Yeah. Everyone loved that it only killed a bunch of people. However, at the end of PARTIZAN, something weird happened. Right? And it became… — let's see if I can draw a pie-chart type vibe — it became three-fold. And The Perennial Wave was only ⅓ of what was there. Right? The other ⅔ were Autonomy Itself — the amalgam Divine god that, which we've only learned recently that Valance and the Nobel worshiped — and Motion. Right? Uh and it seems like Motion has taken a much more active role in taking over the rest of this thing. And… What I thought you were going to do was introduce another kind of cut here or put in… you're going to inject — I'm going draw a little arrow — a… flower… Let's do a… Here's very important…
Keith: Like a graft?
Austin: Exactly! Flower… Let's just do this, and then and then do new text and put in a flower emoji.
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: You're going to put in a flower [chuckles] into Motion's part which would then…
Janine: Mm-hm.
Austin: … cover Motion up with flowers…
Janine: Eat it.
Austin: … and eat it. Exactly. Like this.
Sylvi: Ahhh…!
Keith: Like, covering a brick building with kudzu.
Austin: Like covering a brick building. Yeah! [half-chuckles] This is The Scientist character turning to The Jock…
Keith: Mm-hm.
Austin: … turning to The Rock in this action movie.
Sylvi: [laughs]
Keith: You gotta have someone who can put it in layman's terms!
Janine: [laughs]
Austin: Yeah. [chuckles] Exactly!
Sylvi: [half-chuckles] An English poindexter!
Keith: [laughs]
Janine: This is better than the way I'd been conceptualizing it. Because I'd been thinking about it as like… I don't know…! I don't even know! Just… I don't even know. I… I wish I'd seen this little diagram guy at the start of the Season! It makes every… [overlapping] It makes so much sense, now. Um… [chuckles]
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] Well, then, importantly, these black lines are — and this is maybe, Brnine, a thing that you know intimately — this is where… asepsis did this. Right? Asepsis was the sort of thing that kind of bit it, like: “Yum-yum-yum.”
Janine: [chuckles]
Ali: [overlapping] Mm-hm…
Austin: [overlapping] Like, bit these pieces up and then kind of re-amalgamated them together by mistake. Sort of. Kind of.
[01:00:00]
Austin: Right? During operation Shackled Sun at the end of PARTIZAN. So Asepsis is not in here — but it's sort of the binding agent in some ways. You know?
Keith: Is the… sort of backdrop of the last season — and maybe season and a half —  been the Motion pie getting bigger? [overlapping] On its own?
Austin: [overlapping] In a… Well, not on its own. It's getting bigger in that's what Motion wants. Right? I mean, I think a throughline for all of The Divine Cycle has been: nature won't protect itself from… from Empire. Right? Like, we go back to Twilight Mirage… very-very… maybe controversially, made Qui Err kind of neutral. Even as the New Earth Hegemony was coming in to conquer it and as Advent was coming in to conquer it. And that's, like, a very specific… the Earth doesn't protect itself from imperialists. Or from… you know, exploiters; or people who are trying to extract things.
Motion… Autonomy Itself and Perennial have had… Perennial has always been a very hands-off evil goddess at the center of the universe — considered to be evil because of how the Perennial Wave destroyed things — but has never been like: “I'm going to try to Puppeteer everybody!” Right? And Autonomy Itself isn't that either.
But Motion is. And Motion is going to spread to take over more and more of this… This particle. So yes, Keith. I think that you're right! I think what's probably happened is — I can delete this part, the little… the thing that made it split into an easy thirds — it's instead, like, this now. And Autonomy Itself and Perennial have been reduced inside of the… inside of Kalmeria. To be lesser than. Yes.
Keith: Hmm.
[pause]
Janine: Okay. Um… So… [sighs] I think maybe what this actually looks like in our fake science thing…
Austin: Yeah. Mm-hm. [chuckles]
Janine: And why…
Keith: This is real.
Austin: [laughs]
Janine: Thisbe and Brnine need to work on it together.
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: Uh-huh!
Janine: Is that… I think what needs to happen is Asepsis needs to, like… teach… the pollen…?
Austin: [chuckles]
Janine: In the way that, like, the immune system… You know. [overlapping] Like, immune system learns what a germ is.
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, sure. Yeah.
Janine: And then it's, like…
Dre: I mean…
Janine: “Oh we'll fuck… We'll fuck that up! [overlapping] We’ll eat that!”
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] Like a vaccine. Yeah.
Janine: And then it's a matter… Yeah. And then it's a matter of, like… or at least, like, Asepsis has to, like, develop that, or have that…
Keith: It’s…
Janine: And we have to find a way to… [overlapping] transfer that…
Keith: [overlapping] … RNA. It's Really Nasty Algorithm.
Janine: Yes.
Dre: [chuckles]
Janine: We transfer that into the pollen. And then the pollen is like: “Okay, that's our food!”
Austin: Right.
Janine: When we… You know. And then we… do that and propagate. I also just… I like… My original thing involved… it would have, like, taken the Perennial Wave stuff out of the atmosphere and, like, stuck it somewhere. But I like the idea of The Perennial Wave and this weird thing fusing.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Janine: Because, in my mind, I've been calling this thing Arbor.
Austin: Ooouh! The Divine…
Janine: And I love the idea of Perennial and Arbor.
Austin: Yeah! That's really fun!
Janine: That’s pretty.
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: Hmm!
Janine: Surely nothing bad will happen.
Austin: You know? Who could say! Sometimes, sometimes things are okay. I like this plan. I'm gonna start a Clock! How many steps do you think this Clock is? You've laid out a set of things. One is…
Janine: I kind of feel like it's a set of, like, stuff that has to be completed. Like, I think there is a…
Austin: Yeah. That's what I mean. In a way. Right?
Janine: Yeah. But, like, I mean, specifically, like… That research has to be done with Asepsis.
Austin: [overlapping] Yes.
Keith: [overlapping] So you want a quest log?
Janine: [overlapping] And I think Thisbe’s gonna, like, cast a spell, [chuckles] or something. Um…
Ali: I say 6 Steps.
Austin: That sounds right. And those…
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] It does sound like… The things that you just kind of laid out are what those are. Um. So, yeah. And I wanna… The reason a Clock is nice is ‘cause, like, if you get a really good success you can click it can tick up more than once. You know?
Janine: Yeah.
Austin: Or if you come with another thing that we need to get done it can… it can do that. So I'm going to add a new Clock, here. Put that on the token layer. And then call this… Arbor Project. The Arbor Project.
Ali: I feel like this scene ends with Brnine, like, about to explain a thing… [chuckles] and then just sighing and being, like: “Thisbe, can I just, like, upload this Google Doc to you?” [chuckles]
Austin: [laughs]
Janine: [laughs] Yeah!
Ali: I'm sorry that my decade of, like, notes about Kalmeria… I'm not going to explain out loud to you.
Austin: [sighs]
Ali: But you're a robot. So we could just do this? [chuckles]
Austin: Put the USB key in? [chuckles]
Janine: [chuckles]
Austin: Let's do a roll! Let's… Let's do this! Yeah. Let's… Who's rolling on this? I mean, you could obviously Help each other. But…
Janine: What are we rolling, specifically? [overlapping] Like, what is this action we’re rolling?
Austin: [overlapping] This feels like a Know as a Stat. Right? This might be a custom…
Janine: Like, I feel like the roll should be like: “Oh, this one, we're, like, reading a book.”
Austin: Yeah. I think it's the thing…
Ali: Hm.
Austin: … that Brnine just said.
Janine: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] Which is sharing knowledge about Kalmeria. Right? Give… Bringing you up to date on how Kalmaria works. Right? Giving you the…
Janine: Mm-hm…
Austin: … the 10 years of research on Kalmeria, and Asepsis, and all the stuff Brnine has been… has had Asepsis working on in the background all season. All that stuff. Right? Presumably even, like, how Asepsis works as a thing to make sure that it doesn't see the Arbor pollen as being… you know, impure and dangerous.
Ali: Hm.
Janine: Yeah. Give it some clarity.
Austin: Right. [chuckles] Exactly. Um…
Ali: This feels like maybe a Dispel Uncertainties with a Thisbe assist?
Austin: Yeah. Or a… It might just be that this is Weather The Storm: Know.
Ali: Oh, sure.
Austin: Because we've… we've kind of collectively Dispelled the Uncertainties…
Ali: [chuckles] Sure…!
Austin: … of it.
Janine: [chuckles]
Austin: And Weather The Storm… You know, it's a Know. And then if it's… if it's a success you get ticks. And if you don't… You know.
Ali: [overlapping] Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Austin: [overlapping] I'm probably just going to lift the Clock ticks work from um Beam Saber… Though, actually those same rules might be in here. Or from uh from Blades in the Dark, actually. Which is depending on the degree of successes advances the Clock different numbers depending. So. So, yeah. I think Dispel Uncertainties… Or, sorry, Weather The Storm with Know. What is your Know, Brnine?
Ali: + 2.
Austin: Alright. 2d6 + 2. Or! Wait! Wait, wait! What is your relationship with Thisbe?
Ali: It is a… Oh. I think it might actually be the same. ‘Cause it’s…
Austin: Oh is it + 2 right now okay?
Ali: Oh, no. Yeah. The Gravity is + 2. I have a 3…
Austin: In the Clock.
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] But not the. Yeah.
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah. Gravity’s supposed to…
Austin: [overlapping] So once that fills up to 3 — I mean, this will increase it to 4 because you're doing a roll together. Right? So…
Ali: Hmmm!
Austin: So let's increase both of those to 4. And if…
Janine: Should we read our Clocks?
Austin: Please read your Clocks with each other!
Janine: Uh…
Ali: Sure.
Janine: Mine is: “Brnine is capable, but brittle. They deserve to live a better life than this.” And then it says — unless I click it to see more — it says: “Get them—”
Austin: [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Janine: [laughs] If I click to see more it says: “Get them to it.”
Ali: [laughs]
Janine: Which is different.
Austin: Hmm…!
Dre: [chuckles]
Ali: Mine is: “Thisbe is an important part of my past.”
Austin: Alright.
Ali: Pum-pum-pum.
Austin: Whenever you make a Move involving the other party of a Clock, you may add the Clock's value instead of the normal Trait or Value. If you do so Advance the Clock. So I'm… Let's just say we're using that since it's equal. It's a + 2. So you can both do that throughout this entire thing.
Janine: [overlapping] Hell yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] And, eventually, that'll level up to a 3 in the middle of doing this, presumably.
Ali: [laughs]
Janine: [overlapping] Cool…!
Austin: [overlapping] Which is fun.
Ali: If only! Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] 2d6 + 2.
Ali: [overlapping] But I’m rolling right now.
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: Okay. [overlapping] It’s an 8.
Austin: [overlapping] That is an 8 right now. Thisbe, do you want to help?
Janine: Yeah! [overlapping] I feel like I’m helping!
Austin: [overlapping] This is going to advance basically immediately.
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: [chuckles] Which is very funny. Yeah.
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah.
Ali: [overlapping] This is…
Austin: [overlapping] You are helping. We've already talked about how and why. So…
Ali: When you're in the lab with the homie, you know?
Austin: That's right! So 2d6 + 2 again. Or I guess this is technically this could be higher. Let's make sure that you're not… Before we just make you roll + 2…
Janine: My Know is 0. So…
Austin: Yeah. But your Helper Or Hinder might be higher because you spent meaningful time together — [overlapping] though you've probably not Helped or Hindered, yet, this sortie.
Janine: [overlapping] True.
Austin: Right?
Janine: [overlapping] Um…
Ali: [overlapping] Uh, I think I…
Janine: I don't remember.
Ali: I think I helped out Thisbe. [overlapping] But not Thisbe me.
Austin: [overlapping] But not the other way around. Yeah. That makes sense. Um.
Janine: Yeah.
Austin: Let's call it 2d6 + 2, then!
Janine: Alright.
Austin: Hey! That's a 10!
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah…
Ali: [overlapping] Wow!
Dre: [overlapping] Nice!
Austin: [overlapping] So that means, Brnine, you get a 1d6 to roll, and if you get a 2 or above…
Ali: [overlapping] Alright…
Austin: That's wrong. 3 or above. Fuck! I should have said 3 or above!
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: You got a 2!
Ali: It’s okay.
Janine: Yeah. Do-over! Do-over. [chuckles]
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: Alright. So, yeah. 5 + 2 + 2 is 9. That's still a mixed success which I think is… A pretty… a pretty obvious one for me. Which is it ticks up by one. You do manage to upload the thing. And get all… You're both on the same page in terms of how the Kalmeria particle Works, how broadly you could do all this work… But as you do this, and as you start doing some preliminary tests, I'm going to kick up the Motion clock on both of you. By 1.
Keith: What was Brnine rolling here? The 1d6?
Austin: That was Advantage.
Keith: Ohh! Okay.
Austin: From Thisbe helping.
Keith: Okay. Got it.
Austin: Yeah. Um. Alright. So, homies in the lab.
Cori’s scene [01:09:24]
Austin: Let's cut back out to Cori in the duel.
Sylvi: Alright! I gotta get out of this, huh?
Austin: You're in a tough spot, a little bit!
Sylvi: I am.
Austin: But… importantly, you and I figured out something a second ago. Or I guess 30 minutes ago.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Which was we did not talk about approaches, yet.
Sylvi: No we didn't. Which… I do have something I can do.
Austin: Yup.
Sylvi: But I wanna make sure it's doable, fictionally.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: So… last time… I've used Borrowed Power already before.
Austin: Yes.
Sylvi: I think.
Austin: [overlapping] Yes. Yes. You used it once.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah. ‘Cause I'm missing one Hold off of it.
Austin: Yep.
Sylvi: What I was going to do here was use… use a point of that to activate Empowering Boon and that makes sub… lets me make the Subsystems Move for free.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: “When you do so, describe what mark your patron leaves on the situation.” And that way I would be able to activate my Chromatic Focus again [overlapping] through the Subsystems Move.
Austin: [overlapping] Right. Oh, we're gaming out here!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Ali: [chuckles]
Dre: [overlapping] Hell yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] You're using one Move to power Subsystems to power a third part.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: Yeah. Okay. Absolutely
Sylvi: I'm flipping levers, hitting buttons… [overlapping] all sorts of stuff.
Austin: [overlapping] Praying to Perennial. Yeah. Uh-huh.
Sylvi: Yea-yea-yeah.
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: There's a pray button.
Austin: [chuckles] You just hit the pray button and then…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] … it sends up those prayers. Alright.
Sylvi: Um. So I'm going to reduce my Power down to 1. ‘Cause I believe that's how that still works.
Austin: [overlapping] Ehhh…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Or when it's for free…! Wait!
Austin: No, cause it’s…
Sylvi: If I… Subsystem’s for free so does my Power just stay the same?
Austin: Yeah. Wait. So… It says… Let's see. One second. The Empowering Boon says you may give your Patron one influence to make the Subsystems move for…
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: … for free. Yeah. It's free. That means without — yeah, — decreasing your Power. [overlapping] Totally.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Cool. So I just Influence if that stuff’s for free…?
Austin: [overlapping] So…! I mean, it's worth saying you could instead just spend the Power if you wanted to. But…
Sylvi: I could! Um, but…
Austin: Maybe good to have. It's up to you.
Sylvi: I guess so. See? The… I guess, my thinking was that I needed to do this to do it quick enough. But if I'm able to just do Subsystems in the middle of the fight [overlapping] then I will just spend the power.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. I think you're able to…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] I think you just spend the Power which lets us stay lower on Influence unless you keep your… your Borrowed Power…
Sylvi: Uh…
Austin: … Hold.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Which is really useful to have.
Austin: [overlapping] Which is more universal. Yes. Yes. Totally.
Sylvi: Um. Okay, cool. So that's gonna change my approach to Arcane.
Austin: [overlapping] So… Yup.
Sylvi: [overlapping] I think — similarly to how we described it be before — there's almost, like, a liquid mercury skin…
Austin: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: … over my my mech now.
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: Sort of, like, ever-shifting and stuff. That's how it… sort of represents this… this taking hold… It's Kalmeria Particles. Right?
Austin: Yep.
Sylvi: For the…
Austin: For Arcane.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah. It sure is!
Sylvi: Yeah. Um… and am I just rolling…
Austin: You're rolling to…
Sylvi: … Defy again?
Austin: You're rolling Defy again. But this time take Confidence so 1s count as 6s.
Sylvi: Sick.
[pause]
Sylvi: I got a 12.
Austin: You got a fucking 12. [overlapping] You did…
Dre: [overlapping] Hell yes.
Sylvi: [overlapping] I rolled two 5s.
Austin: Well, you would have… Yeah. I guess you're right. [half-chuckles] Two 5S would have still been a success no matter what!
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: Um. So, yeah. You know, I think you've switched here. And Zig is just struggling to keep up at this point. Right? There is a…
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: You know. Lands a couple of things that would be hits… here. You know? Switches into the… more traditional humanoid mecha mode and, you know, slams down… huge greatsword. Huge, like, fiery greatsword.
Sylvi: I love that we're both doing, like, form shifts.
Austin: Oh, yeah. A hundred percent. [overlapping] It just…
Sylvi: [overlapping] The way I've been thinking of them…
Austin: [overlapping] It just slips off of you it.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] It slips… You know what I mean? Yeah. Go ahead!
Sylvi: I'm, like, slipperier. I'm faster.
Austin: [overlapping] Yea-yea-yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] When I'm powered by Kalmeria Particles.
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: Like, Perennial… The Paramerion is a fast mech.
Austin: Uh-huh.
Sylvi: And Perennial is powering it well when it's got Divine power. But I think that, like, something about it being… using this Alternate Source…
Austin: Uh-huh!
Sylvi: … just lets it, like, put the jets on a lot more.
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. Totally.
Sylvi: Um… Yeah.
Austin: Or normally it's Profane. Right? And now it's… [overlapping] Now it’s… Yea-yea-yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] It is normally profane. Yeah.
Austin: Gotcha. Alright! Well…! Now you can make a traditional attack if you want.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah, I’m gonna!
Austin: [overlapping] You can Exchange Blows! And, again, you take…
Keith: Very traditional.
Austin: [chuckles] You take Confidence here because your approach is strong.
Sylvi: Hell yeah. [half-chuckles] Let me do this trad strike real quick.
Austin: [chuckles]
Dre: [laughs]
Keith: [laughs]
Sylvi: Um…
Austin: 2d6 + 2.
Sylvi: +2 as well. Yeah.
Austin: 1s are 6s.
Keith: I think Trad Strike was your original class.
Austin: [chuckles]
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah, it was.
Austin: [overlapping] That’s so…
Sylvi: [overlapping] I got a 10.
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: You did get a 10! Are you going to give a Peril and take a Risk or just give a Risk?
Sylvi: I will give a Peril and take a Risk.
Austin: Damn. Alright.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Or…
Austin: [overlapping] What is the…
Sylvi: Perils… Wait. Let me… Do Perils make them more, like, weaker?
Austin: [overlapping] Perils… Perils…
Sylvi: [overlapping] I always forget this about Perils. Perils are just harder to get rid of. Right?
Austin: Perils are just harder to get rid of. Correct.
Sylvi: I'm just going to put a Risk on.
Austin: Alright. [overlapping] And stay the same…
Sylvi: [overlapping] If we're in a 1v1 combat I don't expect this guy to, like, run away and heal up in the middle of it.
Austin: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Sylvi: And if he does we're not in 1 on 1 anymore. [overlapping] Open fire!
Austin: [overlapping] You’re not 1 on 1 anymore. That's true. Alright. So…
Sylvi: Um…
Austin: So what is the… I guess I'll decide the Risk, ‘cause Risks are decided by the person.
Sylvi: Yes.
Austin: Um… [overlapping] You know! I think that this is…
Sylvi: [overlapping] I also…
Austin: Go ahead!
Sylvi: I just want to note that Bearer Of Curses would activate here.
Austin: [overlapping] Oooh!
Sylvi: [overlapping] ‘Cause this is the first time in a scene I've Exchanged Blows with someone.
Austin: What is Bearer Of Curses?
Sylvi: “When you Exchange Blows with someone for the first time in a scene choose one: they cannot use Subsystems for the rest of the scene; you leave a difficult to remove brand or mark on them according to your Patron; — or the one that I'm putting here — they suffer misfortune in the future, the next Move against them is made with Advantage.
Austin: Amazing. I think that the fight has kind of drifted… you know, away from your two groups, basically. And I'm giving… I'm giving him “isolated”...
Sylvi: Hell yeah.
Austin: … as the Risk here. Right? Yeah. The duel is happening and it was a duel that zig wanted. But also now further away from his troops. And you can… Let's just stay on you for a second and do one more roll on this.
Sylvi: Yeah! Hell yeah! Okay.
Austin: Let’s cash in that Advantage right away.
Sylvi: I'm not going to let up on the offensive here, then. I think it is just continued, like, flurry of blades from Cori here.
Austin: Cool.
Sylvi: Um…
[01:15:00]
Austin: So, again, 2d6 plus…
Sylvi: 13.
Austin: That's a 13…! It's fucking happening right now.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: Uh… Give me, again, Risk. Risk and not a Peril, presumably.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Uh, what's…
Sylvi: [overlapping] I'm untouched right now so I'm just going to leave it that way as long as I can.
Austin: Smart. Alright. I think that this then is… What are the tags on your weapons, again?
Sylvi: “Bane”...
Austin: Yup:
Sylvi: … “messy”, “two-handed” and “decisive” for the twin sickles.
Austin: Alright. You're not cashing… What's “decisive” do? I always forget. [overlapping] It’s for…
Sylvi: [overlapping] “Decisive” lets me, I believe, reroll Decisive… Strike Decisively.
Austin: That makes sense. Alright.
Sylvi: If it's a failure. I'll double-check on that, though.
Austin: That makes sense. Um… and I'm… You know, I think that there's a… I think “back-footed” here as a Risk. Right? This is not the way this normally goes for… for this person. For zig.
Sylvi: Mm-hm.
Austin: Zig is not someone who gets… who commonly is able to… or commonly pushed like this in a fight.
Sylvi: It was their idea.
Austin: It was their idea. Alright.
Leap’s scene [01:16:00]
Austin: Uh. Leap! You still sniping?
Keith: Um… So I would… I've been thinking — because we were talking about approaches — that maybe my time would be more effectively spent on some of this stuff that's weak to Arcane.
Austin: Hm.
Keith: Namely, the stuff that's Divine.
Austin: Sure.
Keith: Um… On the other hand I do have that thing that… Well, is that still…? Yeah, I do have this Pact #2 that's out of formation.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Keith: Maybe I should just finish it off — unless someone else is, like… [overlapping] “I can finish that off?”
Austin: [overlapping] Let's do… Like, with Cori let's do two things here.
Keith: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] So if you want to start by trying to finish this thing off…
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: … and getting Leap… — or, sorry — getting Levi [chuckles] out of harm's way [overlapping] that would might be a way a good place to start.
Keith: [overlapping] Sure.
Austin: [clears his throat]
Keith: Um… Yeah. Let's do that. [overlapping] I'm going to…
Austin: [overlapping] So, Strike Decisively.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: And this, again, you are firing Element… — not elemental — Arcane uh against Elemental which does not have any…
Keith: Right. And 3d6 + 2 for Strike Decisively is a… is a 12.
Austin: Is a 12. That, of course, is just a win here. “Director characters are killed, forced to retreat or otherwise removed as threat per the fiction.” I think this time, you know, your crew just starts picking them off…
Keith: Yeah. Oh, can I do a cool one? Can I do a cool one?
Austin: You can do whatever you want, Keith.
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Keith: I've got these grape shop bolos…!
Austin: Ohhh…!
Keith: I just want, like… a trick shot and, like, an archery thing. You know, like, a Robin Hood: Men and Tights thing…
Sylvi: [laughs quietly]
Keith: … of, like, each instead of a, like, shotgun blast where the bolos are, like, meant to hit a wide target…
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: … just each one of these bolos connects with one of these small ships…
Austin: Mm-hm.
Keith: … and goes straight through.
Austin: Love it. Incredible. So then. Yeah. You've sent them reeling. Most of them are destroyed. Maybe a couple of them try to retreat. But they're off the board, at this point.
Keith: Great.
Austin: Now, your second idea was about the Divines that are lingering here.
Keith: Yes.
Austin: Which of course our Valour Present and Ekpyrosis. Those are the ones that have the Divine approach. And they are in fact approaching, as you can see.
Keith: Well, obviously, it would be extremely dishonorable to attack Valour.
Austin: Uh-huh.
Keith: But I'm a fucking pirate.
Sylvi: [shouting] Keith!
Keith: [chuckles]
Sylvi: [shouting] My honorable duel!
Austin: [laughs]
Keith: [laughs]
Austin: Oh… It’s very funny. Alright! What's this look like?
Keith: If… I want to say if Silvi doesn't want me to do this, or Cori doesn't want me to do this…
Sylvi: Cori doesn't want anybody to do this!
Keith: Okay. [overlapping] I won’t do it. I won’t fuck with you.
Austin: [overlapping] Cori, you sent this word out. You said leave us be.
Sylvi: Yeah.!
Keith: Okay.
Sylvi: I've said “let me handle it”.
Keith: Okay. That's fine.
Sylvi: This one's mine. [overlapping] I'm kicking his ass right now.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah. You're “Zechs Merquise and Heero Yui”-ing right now.
Austin: That's right.
Sylvi: Yeah, exactly!
Austin: Yeah. Uh-huh.
Keith: Um…
Sylvi: I'm in scary Wing Gundam! Like…
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Austin: [overlapping] You are! That’s true!
Keith: I sort of feel like maybe the first shot on the Ekpyrosis should be the huge gun, the Earth gun, the doooo-hickey.
Austin: The do… the doooo-hickey.
Sylvi: Uh… [chuckles]
Keith: [overlapping] So maybe…
Sylvi: [overlapping] It could be… Sorry. I don't mean to interrupt.
Keith: That's alright.
Sylvi: We don't know the defenses on it so, like, a test shot might also not be a terrible idea. [overlapping] Just to be like…
Keith: [overlapping] That’s true.
Sylvi: … is there a shield we need to deactivate? I don't know. Maybe that's something Austin would have just told us. I don't know.
Austin: Alright!
Keith: Does…
Sylvi: [laughs]
Dre: [chuckles]
Sylvi: Okay!
Keith: Is there, like, an obvious threat coming from either the Ekpyrosis or Present? Present's closer.
Austin: Once they get here they will be big problems. Yes.
Keith: I'm going to hit Present — is closer. Let's do Present.
Austin: You're going to have to get closer to Present in order to snipe that far away, though.
Keith: Okay.
Austin: As a reminder,  again, you know, we know what the range of your tank is — it is not past these Portcullis Gates. Where it's still out there. So you're going to need to ride out there. Is your tank going to be on top of someone's ship? What's the… What's the play?
Keith: [overlapping] That’s very funny.
Austin: [overlapping] You’re hopping on KO Rook's ship?
Keith: Yeah. Sure. I'll get some… Get some mag treads.
Austin: Yea-yea-yeah. Of course! Toss that bad boy on top of a spaceship. [chuckles]
Keith: [laughs]
Austin: This the first time you've gotten into see KO Rook probably since you… since Partizan days. Maybe that's not true! You've been at… It's not, like, you've been… [overlapping] Not… Yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] Right. I've been… on Partizan.
Austin: You've been… Yeah. Y’all have… Y’all been working maybe together.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: So maybe this is a classic maneuver, [chuckles] actually!
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] This is a well-practiced…
Keith: [overlapping] This is it. This is… We've planned this.
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Um… I do think that there needs to be a Defy Danger roll here just to not take… attacks from these surrounding troops?
Keith: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] The… You know, the Pact… The various Pact ships that are kind of a wall, a blockade in front of Present…
Keith: Okay.
Austin: … here. So… [overlapping] Give me a…
Keith: [overlapping] My Defy is 1, I think.
Austin: I think, actually think it's a… It could be Defy directly. But I think it actually could be that you're…
Keith: Clash?
Austin: Clash.
Keith: [overlapping] Okay. Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] That you're clearing the air. You're effectively shooting to make space for yourself. You know?
Keith: Yeah. And that… that makes sense as, like, you know… if I've been working… if I  can do this with AO Rook we know how to do it without blowing up.
Austin: Yes. Exactly. Yeah. [half-chuckles] Uh-huh. Well, we'll find out. [overlapping] Let's see what… to find out…
Keith: [overlapping] 11!
Austin: That works for me! So, yeah. You manage to, like, blast a hole in the formation of these ships not… — and these mechs —, basically.
Keith: Right.
Austin: Not a hole in the sense that they've been damaged. But enough that you can get close enough in order to take a shot at Present.
Keith: Okay.
Austin: Now! The bigger question… what — and maybe we should have talked about this ahead of time: your stuff is “bane”. Right? So that's… That is actually enough. Right? [overlapping] It is.
Keith: [overlapping] It sure is. Yeah.
Austin: Let me double-check.
Keith: Uh, sorry. It's “ruin”.
Austin: [overlapping] It’s “ruin”. Which is…
Keith: [overlapping] It's not… So even better.
Austin: That's the higher one. [overlapping] That's the Tier 2.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: The two Tiers up. And your stuff is, traditionally, Tier…?
Keith: 3.
Austin: It is traditionally Tier 3. Alright. ‘Cause you're in it. [overlapping] ‘Cause if you're in the tank you’re Tier 3. Yes.
Keith: [overlapping] When I'm the… When I'm piloting the mech…
Austin: [overlapping] Alright.
Keith: [overlapping] … — yeah — with my crew then I'm then we're Tier 3.
Austin: Alright. So then with the combination of it being “area”, “bane”, “messy”, and “reload”, you load up the…
Keith: Uh, wrong. You're looking at the wrong one!
Austin: Oh.
Keith: It's actually the “sniper rifle 2” — which is “area”, “ruin”.
Austin: “Area”, “ruin”. Okay.
Keith: Yeah. This is my magic… This is my magic gear.
Austin: [overlapping] Right. That’s not what I…
Keith: [overlapping] That I get from Well Equipped.
Austin: … in the Precipice. Right? That's just your thing.
Keith: No, no. That's on the Precipice.
Austin: Oh, I thought the Precipice was the thing above it. Okay.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Alright.
Keith: This was confusing before, but this is where we landed on.
Austin: This is where we landed. Alright. 2d6 plus… plus your Clash. Which is 2.
Keith: [overlapping] 2d6 + 2.
Austin: [overlapping] 1s are 6s ‘cause of Confidence.
[pause]
Keith: [overlapping] A 9!
Austin: [overlapping] Alright. That is a 9. So on a mixed success with Exchange Blows both you and your target are forced to take a Risk.
Keith: Someone wanna help me get this to a 10?
Austin: Um… I think the only person who's around who could help you with that is Levi. Or you could cash in a Crew roll on this. But that's a…
Keith: Or I could cash in a… my last Hold on Bardic Inspiration.
Austin: True. You could do that. 
Keith: But… This is such a good… This is such a good opportunity for help because I only need one more…
Austin: Mm-hm.
Keith: Oh, wait! But I still it means I have to roll higher than…
Austin: A 4.
Keith: [overlapping] A… A 3, right?
Austin: [overlapping] You need a 5 or a 6. Oh, right. Higher than a 3.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] A 3… Yeah. 4, 5, or 6 would get you there.
Dre: Hm. Sure, I'll help out with that! When has that gone wrong for me today?
Keith: Oh, yikes! Well…
Dre: [laughs]
Keith: You know…
Dre: [overlapping] Hey, it’s fine.
Keith: [overlapping] Dre, you're you're in a tough spot! Maybe we should…
Austin: [overlapping] Well, the…
Keith: [overlapping] Maybe I should just take the Risk.
Austin: I think… No. I think… I think Levi's gotten out of that spot.
Keith: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] ‘Cause you knocked out that first Pact ship.
Keith: Um. Okay.
Austin: So we can move that Star-Crossed ship with Levi in it down towards you.
Keith: Although, two… two Perils. Right, Levi? [overlapping] “Self-doubt” and “scorched”.
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, yeah. That's true. That’s true!
Dre: Yea-yea-yeah. That's not great.
Austin: So, yeah. I'll let y'all discuss…
Keith: I'll… I'll take the Risk. I'll take the Risk.
Austin: Okay. So two Risks here. What Risk are you taking… I mean, I guess you were also a little isolated, a little surrounded maybe?
Keith: Yeah. Um… Could I have taken a… Could I have taken a hit from one of these…
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] … like, an indirect, like, a glancing blow?
Austin: Totally.
Keith: From one of these ships? And we take the Risk “spinning”?
Austin: Oh, that's fun! Yeah. Take the Risk “spinning”. And I think Present is going to take the Risk “annoyed”. [chuckles]
Dre: [laughs]
Keith: Hm. Okay.
Austin: You are a… You are a fucking pirate on a tank on a spaceship! You are so… euegh. It's, like, a gnat. Euegh! “Get away from me! Stop annoying me!” And that's a good place to put Present, because Present makes bad decisions. So then, yeah.
Levi’s scene [01:24:21]
Austin:  Let's go to Levi. Levi?
Dre: [overlapping] So…
Austin: [overlapping] This battle is big. It's all around you. What do you… What's your play here?
Dre: [sighs] Whoohf. What is my play here? Um… Okay. Remind me again…
Austin: Mm-hm.
Dre: … because I am totally forgetting our, like, our Elemental wheel here thing.
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: I'm Mundane.
Austin: [overlapping] Mundane.
Dre: [overlapping] That means I’m weak against Divine.
Austin: It means you are weak… No. It means you are weak against… Maybe you're right. No, Mundane week against Elemental.
Dre: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] Which is anything with green on the map. Right? So the Pact… #3 here…
Dre: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Austin: This kind of fang. The Pact #5 and the Pact #4 — which is a cool spider mech [overlapping] that we didn't get to show off called the Mandible.
Dre: [overlapping] Woouhh!
Austin: It’s way in the south here. So any of the green stuff you are weak against.
Dre: Okay. [overlapping] But I…
Austin: [overlapping] You're strong against anything blue! Like the Pact #1.
Dre: [overlapping] Like this Pact #1.
Austin: Or the Pact #6. Yeah. The Pact #1 is another one of those wizard orbs… [chuckles]
Sylvi: [laughs]
Austin: … that projects defensive shields near anything it's near.
Dre: Oouh!
Austin: So you'll know that it will have at least Ward, and it might be even giving Ward to that other Pact thing that's near it, now that they're all, you know, unified again.
Dre: Okay. Yeah. That sounds like a good thing to take out, then!
Austin: Sure. Give me a… Exchange Blows! Tell me what this looks like!
Dre: Whoo! [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] Whooh. That's a 10.
Dre: Yeah. I finally… I got the good numbers back.
Austin: You got the good numbers.
Dre: Um… [overlapping] I think this… This is…
Austin: [overlapping] And again this is, like, probably…
Dre: [overlapping] I think this is Levi's Bois more than Levi.
Austin: Yeah. Okay.
Dre: Like, I think, like, the ship, like, swoops up, picks up Levi… Levi's in, like, the cargo bay — like, getting patched up — and I think other members of the crew… I don't think the ship has any guns on it.
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: For real.
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: I think it's… It's people, like, hanging out the side of the cargo bay…
Austin: [chuckles]
Dre: … just fucking, like, firing… anti-air missiles and stuff like that.
Austin: You’re doing Mad Max in space.
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: We were doing… Yea-yea-yeah. That's really fun. That's really great. That's a good distinguishing quality for this, like… This is the way Levi's Bois fight — is hanging off the side of spaceships, throwing shit, shooting shit. I love it. Um… Are you…
Sylvi: “Witness me, Levi!”
Austin: [chuckles]
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: Oh no!
Dre: [overlapping] Don’t do that!
Austin: [overlapping] Dark… Dark ending for Levi!
Keith: [chuckles]
Dre: Don’t do that!
Austin: Are you taking a Risk, and… Sorry. Are you giving a Risk or are you giving a Peril and taking a Risk?
Dre: Oh, no. I'm giving a Risk. [chuckles]
Austin: Yeah. [overlapping] You're not going to go down to Defenceless?
Dre: [overlapping] Yea-yea-yeah.
Austin: Okay.
Dre: No, I'm good.
Austin: Uh. Yeah. I think that the Pact… The Pact orb, the wizard orb here, and its unit… is going to take the Risk… “harassed” as you… as you and your crew are doing these kind of strafing runs — not shooting guns from the front of the ship strafing runs — but flying past it again and again at high speeds… distracting it as you do this. And it's going to take this one. It's not extending its shield to prevent this particular attack.
Dre: Nice.
Austin: Maybe saving that for something else. Who could say? And just as we did with Cori and Leap… let's give you, Levi, another… action here.
Dre: Yeah. Sure.
Austin: You double down, try to… [overlapping] make this thing Defenceless?
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah. I think so. And yeah. Maybe this… This is, like, Levi's back in the fight. And so they do another… another run. And Levi, like, pops out the back.
Austin: Yeah. Sword out. Let's see it! 2d6 + 1.
Dre: Oh no!
Austin: [overlapping] That’s just fuckin’...
Dre: [overlapping] I should have just let all my friends shoot things!
Keith: [overlapping] Oh my god. [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] That’s a fucking 5! That’s not good!
Keith: [overlapping] Some lopsided rolls tonight here, huh?
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah. It is.
Austin: Wait, no, no, no! No, no, no, no-no-no-no-no-no!
Keith: [overlapping] [semi-singing] No-no-no-no-no.
Dre: [overlapping] Oh, right! ‘Cause I have… Advantage…?
Keith: [overlapping] Confidence.
Austin: [overlapping] Confidence! This is why you did this.
Dre: [overlapping] Oh, yeah!
Austin: [overlapping] The 1 is a 6! 6 + 3 + 1 is 10!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Let's gooo…!
Dre: [overlapping] Yeaaah!
Keith: [overlapping] Wow.
Austin: Umm…
Sylvi: You just need to remember to believe in yourself!
Austin: That's right? [chuckles]
Dre: [laughs]
Austin: You just need to remember how the rules work!
Dre: Ahhh…!
Austin: [overlapping] Yes. Yes.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Well, that's just how I interpret Confidence.
Austin: Right. [overlapping] Exactly.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: A hundred percent.
Dre: The power of god and anime and something something.
Austin: [chuckles] That's right!
Sylvi: [overlapping] That’s…
Austin: [overlapping] And I mean…
Sylvi: Don't steal my catchphrase.
Austin: [chuckles]
Dre: Oh, sorry.
Sylvi: [laughs]
Austin: I think… The thing that has happened here is, you know, it has up its Arcane shield, it's Kalmeria shield — that don't mean shit when you just got a big sword!
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: The big sword just passes through the shield rendering it Defenceless. Now, it still has Ward… So actually… Actually, maybe it doesn't work that way. Because does Ward…?
Dre: [overlapping] Ward negates something…
Austin: [overlapping] Ward prevents physical… Yeah. It negates physical damage. Um… An incoming source of harm from a Peril or Risk… or from a Risk to a nothing. So, actually, you do have a choice here. It will reduce this. You know. You're passing through the shield and then I think it, like, juices the shield, basically.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Right? Um. And you could turn it… you could… it's going to get reduced from a Risk to nothing — unless you take a Peril…. or, sorry. Unless you take a…
Dre: [overlapping] A Risk.
Austin: [overlapping] Unless you upgrade it up to a Peril. In which case it would still take the Risk. Yeah.
Dre: Yeah. Yea-yea-yeah. Um…
Keith: Don’t… Don't do it, Levi.
Dre: No, I'm not gonna do it.
Austin: Alright. So it deflects the… It looks like it's going to go through and then it kind of sends a pulse to its… to its shield, which manages to push your sword up at the last second, keeping the… the central orb unit safes.
Keith: Progress just to get rid of the Ward.
Austin: That's true. [overlapping] That is progress.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah, for sure!
Austin: That's absolutely true. And it means that it can't put that Ward on something else — which, again, is the thing that these orbs do.
Thisbe’s scene [1:29:36]
Austin: Back in the lap — Brnine and Thisbe.
Keith: [semi-singing in a placid voice] Working in the lab…[9]
Sylvi: [laughs]
Keith: [laughs]
Ali: Wow…!
Austin: Late one night…
Sylvi: We did the Mesh…
Dre: [laughs]
Austin: [laughs]
Keith: My eyes beheld a floral sight!
Austin: Ohh…! [chuckles]
Dre: [chuckles]
Sylvi: We did the Arbor mash!
Keith: [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: [chuckles] Ehhh… Well, at our current rate [overlapping] this will come out around Halloween…
Sylvi: [overlapping] It was a garden smash!
Austin: [overlapping] … we'll finally finish PALISADE by Halloween.
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvi: Yeah…
Austin: So… Um…
[01:30:00]
Ali: [sighs] Oh, no. Huh?
Austin: What's Step Two?
Dre: [laughs]
Keith: [laughs]
Sylvi: [laughs] The producer just came out there!
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Yeah. Uh-huh!
Sylvi: That was… That was not Ali the role-player.
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: That was Ali: “Fuck, I got to edit this!”
Ali: [sighs]
Austin: Mm-hm. We're making progress! We're making moves!
Ali: We are! We are, we are, we are.
Sylvi: Mm-hm.
Ali: Okay. Um…
Austin: Alright.
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Ali: Are we… Is the next step plant growth?
Austin: Could be!
Ali: Or is it microwave…
Janine: Um…
Ali: … pollen? [chuckles]
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Dre: Hmmm…!
Janine: [chuckles]
Sylvi: Huh…!
Austin: Hmm. Yummy.
Sylvi: Instant pollen!
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvi: Just microwave!
Ali: In the Perennial microwave. You know.
Sylvi: [laughs]
Dre: Yeah. No, that made it make more sense.
Keith: [overlapping] The Perennial microwave.
Sylvi: [laughs] That makes it…
Ali: [overlapping] We totally talked about it! [chuckles]
Sylvi: [overlapping] That makes it make sense for us. That makes it make sense for us only.
Dre: [chuckles] No…
Sylvi: But you saying “the Perennial microwave” just sounds, like, something insane. [chuckles]
Austin: [chuckles]
Janine: [chuckles]
Austin: Yeah!
Janine: Um… Okay. So we have the thing where it's, like, we both now understand…
Austin: Correct.
Janine: … how the bits work.
Austin: Yeah.
Janine: How bits do.
Austin: Yeah.
Janine: I think the next step would then be, like… getting the bits into a bit of the plant. So that's, like, some plant science. That's probably some… some Thisbe… [overlapping] plant science.
Ali: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Austin: [overlapping] So you're going to take the roll here — Thisbe?
Janine: I think so.
Austin: Alright. Yeah.
Janine: But I kind of had imagined this as like… I don't know. I don't know. I've been thinking… You know, I've shown a lot of Thisbe, like, doing normal plant stuff…?
Austin: Yeah.
Janine: … over the course of two seasons.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Janine: And I feel like I need to clarify that the things she's doing with this plant aren't, like, normal plant stuff necessarily.
Austin: Is this more slipstream-y, strati-y adjacent stuff?
Janine: A little bit.
Austin: Okay.
Janine: Like, this is… You know… When I said that… I always want to say Levi.[10] That Levi… When… You know. When they found Thisbe, she had, like, a little plant thing wrapped around her horn [overlapping] and still does?
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. Yeah.
Janine: That’s what she's been doing. It’s, like, when she gets a little clipping…
Austin: Mm-hm.
Janine: … she grafts it onto herself first.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Janine: And, like, is with it for a little bit. Her and, essentially, Integrity and Ebullience.
Austin: Right.
Janine: And then she's grafting it onto this larger plant.
Austin: Interesting!
Janine: So that's nonsense. Right? Like… [chuckles] Relative to… Compared to what Thisbe was doing…
Austin: Right. [overlapping] Sorry. Yes.
Janine: [overlapping] … in the hydroponics bay…
Austin: Yes. [overlapping] Right.
Janine: [overlapping] That's nonsense.
Austin: You are the hydroponics bay now, in a weird way.
Janine: Yeah.
Sylvi: [laughs]
Austin: And that's not how anything really works.
Janine: [overlapping] No.
Austin: [overlapping] But it is in our space-magic world. Yeah.
Janine: Yeah. We also don't have robot goats. So…
Austin: Not yet. [overlapping] Yeah. We will…
Janine: [overlapping] Like, in real life. So.
Dre: Ehhh…!
Austin: Unfortunately, we’re on the way.
Keith: Do we not have robot goats? I swear that we did.
Austin: We might. Anyway! So you're doing that part now. You're passing it through…
Janine: Yeah.
Austin: … the Integrity–Ebullience system… and the Thisby system — and producing the sort of, like…
Janine: Like, imbuing a clipping. [overlapping] Yes.
Austin: [overlapping] Right. Yeah. Yeah. You're kind of, like, making this sort of, like, candidate batch. You know? Not… Not Divine Candidate terminology! The sort of, like, scientific…
Janine: [chuckles] [overlapping] That scared me for second! [laughs]
Austin: [overlapping] No, no, no. Yeah. You're making the sort of, like, here is the batch of this plant that we're going to use for the rest of this… thing. Yeah.
Janine: Mm-hm.
Austin: Alright. That sounds… again, we're going to keep on moving with it! That's a 2d6 plus your… I mean, Brnine is… Brnine is here. Right? So you're doing all this together?
Janine: [overlapping] True.
Austin: [overlapping] This continues? So you can… + 2… for… with your relationship with Brnine!
Janine: What's the actual thing I'd be rolling now?
Austin: It is… your Gravity Clock with Brnine: 2d6 + 2.
Janine: Okay! Okay.
Austin: That is an 11! That is a full success!
Janine: [reservedly] [overlapping] Hooray!
Austin: [overlapping] I'm going to advance this clock by two! [vocalizes while doing it] As it continues.
Janine: I know this plant… so well. We get along so good.
Austin: And this Advances your Brnine clock — and your Thisbe clock, Brnine — to 6. Which means it fills up, becomes + 3, and you're both going to get to write a new Bond with each other. Or a new Hook with each other. If you want to.
Or… I mean, I guess really the thing that happens is you can “redefine the relationship;” advance … taking “an advancement” — leveling up! — “starting a new Gravity Clock and increasing its value by 1” to + 3. Committing “to the relationship, increasing its value by 1” to a + 3, and taking an advancement; then you “circle the filled Clock—it can't be filled any further. When you take action that ends this relationship, like sacrificing yourself for your beloved or betraying the person you're supposed to be loyal to, succeed as if you rolled a 10 and cross out that clock forever.”
Dre: [overlapping] Damn.
Janine: [overlapping] Whoa.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Goddamn.
Austin: [overlapping] Or abandoning that relationship.
Dre: [overlapping] Jesus.
Austin: “You may take an advancement, erasing the Gravity Clock and freeing up a spot for a new one.” This is on page 12. I'm just going to screenshot it…
Ali: [overlapping] [chuckles] Please. Thank you.
Austin: [overlapping] … and put it in our chat — so y'all can think about it.
Sylvi: [laughs]
Austin: Uh-huh.
Janine: Jokes on everyone who called Brnine divorced!
Austin: [laughs]
Sylvi: Just going to put this gun over the mantelplace real quick!
Austin: [chuckles] Uh-huh! I think it's useful to have it. You know?
Keith: Hey, divorced people can have… relationships! [chuckles]
Austin: [chuckles] This is true. Uh-huh.
Dre: It’s true.
Janine: Uh-huh.
Austin: So, yeah. So that… you're both at… +3 on your clocks for each other now. [overlapping] I almost…
Janine: [overlapping] I think… I… Yeah. I think I'm committing.
Austin: You're committing to…
Janine: I don't want to redefine it. I think this is just still true.
Austin: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So…
Janine: [overlapping] Whoops.
Austin: [overlapping] So, and that… Can you read that again, one more time?
Janine: “Brnine is capable, but brittle. They deserve to live a better life than this — get them to it.”
Austin: [overlapping] And you're committing.
Janine: [overlapping] That sounds like a great thing to die for!
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: [overlapping] Oh my god!
Janine: [overlapping] You know?!?
Sylvi: [overlapping] Goddamn!
Keith: [overlapping] Wow.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Goddamn!
Austin: [overlapping] Aaaargh…!
Janine: [overlapping] I'm not… I'm not saying I'm going to! What I'm saying if it happens…
Keith: [overlapping] Hmmm…!
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah, I agree!
Keith: [overlapping] It’s… [chuckles]
Janine: … of course that's going to be the bomb!
Keith: I'm not saying I'm just… I'm merely invoking!
Austin: Yeah. Uh-huh.
Janine: [laughs]
Sylvi: [exaggeratedly] Just ‘cause the gun's over the mantleplace…
Keith: [laughs]
Sylvi: [continuing] … doesn't mean I'm going to use it!
Austin: Maybe I just think it looks sick up there!
Keith: [chuckles]
Sylvi: I'm…!
Janine: [overlapping] Maybe…!
Sylvi: [overlapping] It's called interior decorating!
Austin: That's fucking right!
Janine: Yeah!
Dre: Listen, my really good friend Chekhov gave it to me…
Austin: [laughs]
Dre: … and it has a lot of fond memories!
Janine: [chuckles]
Austin: Why do you hate decor so much?
Sylvi: Oh, you got a problem with Eastern Europeans?
Austin: [chuckles] [overlapping] That’s what it is!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Is that what… understanding here?
Austin: Yeah. Um. Cool. Alright. The Arbor Project continues.
Brnine’s scene [01:36:25]
Austin: Brnine, do you… Or, do you want to follow up on this?
Ali: I need to rewrite mine, [overlapping] obviously.
Austin: [overlapping] Okay, so let’s… Let’s…
Ali: I'm not going to do that in this… [overlapping] second.
Austin: [overlapping] In this moment.
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Sure. I meant follow up on the action — not follow up on the… Yeah. But importantly, you're not going to commit to… Sorry. You're not using the commit action to commit to “Thisbe is an important part of my [overlapping] past” as a whole of your thing. You are gonna redefine it, instead.
Dre: [overlapping] Wow…!
Ali: [overlapping] Right, yeah. I am going to redefine this.
Austin: Okay. Cool.
Ali: Um…
Austin: Do you want…
Ali: I… So… Okay. Thisbe is working on the plant right now.
Austin: Yeah. Successfully, seemingly!
Ali: Uhh…
Austin: And by working on I think what that means, again, is it is… it is passing through her weird Divine slash… God, what are… What are they called? Why am I blinking what Ebullience is called? [sighs]
Janine: [overlapping] Axiom?
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. The axiom system that is alive inside of Thisbe. It's kind of germinating inside of… and through Thisbe. And it's growing… It's going to grow, like, off of your horns and you'll do clippings? Is that what's happening, Thisbe?
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah. Basically.
Austin: [overlapping] Okay! Great.
Dre: [overlapping] Hm.
Janine: Thisbe's turned into that deer Pokemon. [overlapping] I guess… [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] That's kind of cool. They’re kinda cool.
Dre: [overlapping] Stantler?
Janine: I hadn't really thought about it, but… Yeah…
Ali: [chuckles]
Janine: No, not the one that has the butt face.
Dre: [overlapping] Wow.
Janine: [overlapping] The one with the…
Keith: [overlapping] Deerling?
Janine: [overlapping] The good-looking one.
Keith: Deerling? [overlapping] Yeah.
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah. No. The grownup one.
Keith: [overlapping] Oh…
Ali: [overlapping] The one that changes. Right?
Janine: [overlapping] Deerling’s the baby.
Ali: Through seasons?
Janine: Deerling also changes. But… Grownup Deerling.
Keith: Uh… I can do this…! Uh… Sawsbuck!
Dre: I think that's right.
Janine: [overlapping] I guess, yeah. Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Whaa…!
Austin: [overlapping] Sawsbuck is cool!
Janine: [overlapping] Sawsbuck's great.
Dre: Yeah. Sawsbuck is cool.
Ali: Is this, like, a…
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Janine: Stantler has a butt for a face and I don't like it.
Sylvi: Damn! [inaudible]
Keith: [overlapping] Stantler… Stantler is a big miss. Could have been a very cool Gen 2 Pokémon…
Dre: [overlapping] Wow, he does have a butt for a face!
Janine: Yeah, Stantler’s gross!
Keith: Sawsbuck is really [overlapping] them taking another run at Stantler.
Janine: [overlapping] Stantler…
Austin: Hm…
Janine: Stantler is, like, an elephant seal but a deer, and also has one huge buttcheek. I just think it's awful.
Keith: I like that it hypnotizes you with its Christmas bells.
Austin: That's the tail! That's not a buttcheek. Right? It's, like, a…
Janine: I mean, I know what it's supposed to be. [overlapping] But I don't think that's what it is.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah…
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. Okay. I got you.
Dre: It's unfortunately bulbous.
Keith: [laughs]
Janine: Yeah.
Austin: I'm glad we got that audio clip for… [overlapping] all future use…!
Keith: [overlapping] What about Wyrdeer though? I like Wyrdeer from… Arceus.
Austin: Brnine!
Janine: [overlapping] I don't know what that is…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Oh, sure.
Ali: [overlapping] Hi! [chuckles]
Austin: What are you doing?
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: Catch Pokémon?
Ali: I… Well… The first thing that I was thinking: is this the part of the stage where, like, I take one of those early clippings and let Asepsis, like, sniff it?
Austin: [overlapping] Sure. Yes.
Ali: [overlapping] Like, in introducing a cat to… a new… [chuckles] environment?
Austin: Yeah. You put them in the same room, but you put a gate between them?
Ali: [overlapping] Uh-huh. Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] So they can't… Yea-yea-yeah.
Ali: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Austin: Yeah. Yeah.
Ali: Taking it slow. You know?
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: For the next hour…
Austin: Let's do it! [overlapping] That makes sense!
Ali: [overlapping] What do we roll here?
Austin: [overlapping] It's the… This continues to be either Know or your relationship with Thisbe.
Ali: Um. Yeah. Which is now + 3. [overlapping] Okay, cool.
Austin: [overlapping] Which is now +3. Yeah.
Ali: I was, like, looking at my Hold stuff — ‘cause I have that, like, Asepsis Confidence Hold… [overlapping] thing…?
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, you do! Yeah.
Ali: I have 1 left.
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: And I have one organic… Tactical Genius Hold as well. I can… I can take Confidence after the fact, though. Right? So let me just roll this…
Austin: Wait, can you take Confidence…?
Ali: From the Asepsis thing.
Austin: Oh, from the Asepsis thing! I think that we've always said that yes.
Ali: Okay. Let me just roll it…! Let's see how it goes fresh!
Keith: Let’s see how it goes fresh!
Austin: Let's see how it goes fresh! There a 2d6 + 3?
Ali: + 3. Yeah.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Ali: That’s an 8.
Austin: You could take Confidence and it would make that 1 a 6! Right now it's an 8.
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] Hmm…
Austin: [overlapping] 1 + 4 + 3 is 8 — which is a Mixed Success! And you know what it's gonna be!
Ali: [overlapping] What?
Austin: [overlapping] It's gonna be the “Motion continues to eat away inside of you”.
Ali: Inside of me?
Austin: Yeah! Both of you!
Keith: You’re at a 2!
Ali: Oh, both of us! Okay.
Austin: Yeah. Mm-hm.
Ali: Um… Then, yeah. Let me do it. What else am I doing?
Austin: Go ahead and spend the Hold…
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: … you're saving to prevent that from happening.
Keith: [laughs]
Janine: [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Me as the… necromantic molecule grows in my body…
Keith: [overlapping] Whatever… Might as well…
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: [overlapping] I may as well not… I may as well stop that from happening, I guess! I don’t know what else I’m doing!
Ali: If it was just me I would think it would be kind of funny. But I don't want that to happen to Thisbe, too!
Austin: [overlapping] That's very kind…
Keith: [overlapping] Awww…
Janine: [overlapping] Awww….
Austin: [overlapping] That’s very… This is very good. Which is also funny because it means you're, like, introducing Asepsis to Arbor, while also having other Asepsis units, like, clear the air of the Mo… of Motion's influence, simultaneously? They're tog… Maybe that's what they're bonding… [chuckles]
Ali: [laughs]
Janine: I mean, yeah!
Austin: [overlapping] That's kind of the whole thing!
Janine: [overlapping] That’s kind of the… Right?
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah. Right. [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah!
Janine: Like, teaching… Awww…! It's… Yeah.
Austin: [chuckles]
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Lord! Uh… Okay!
Janine: It's, like, the old cat teaching the kitten to use the stairs!
Austin: In this case the stairs is eating Motion! Alive!
Ali: [laughs]
Janine: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah. [overlapping] Good.
Ali: [overlapping] Yummy!
Janine: That's what stairs kind of are.
Austin: Yeah. In a way. For sure.
Cori’s scene [01:41:48] 
Austin: Cori!
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: Duel time.
Sylvi: It's duel time!
Austin: D-d-d-d-d-duel!
Sylvi: Thank you, you beat me to it. Alright. Um… Time to send this guy to the Shadow Realm.
Austin: That's fucking right.
Sylvi: [sighs] Listen…! It's what I'm doing here! I feel like this just… fight just keeps going the way it is. Right? Where I'm just atta…
Austin: [overlapping] You’re winning.
Sylvi: [overlapping] I'm keeping on the offense!
Austin: You're winning. [overlapping] You're winning. Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah. I'm winning handily! [chuckles]
Dre: You kinda kicking this guy's ass!
Sylvi: A little bit!
Austin: Let’s do this! Keep on keeping on, [overlapping] then 2d6 + Clash!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Ace pilot my ass.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah, apparently!
Sylvi: Well…!
Keith: Wow.
Dre: [laughs]
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, that's a 6, ain’t it?
Keith: [overlapping] Lotta talk!
Austin: [overlapping] A lot of… A lot of…
Keith: [overlapping] Lotta talk before that roll!
Sylvi: Well, wait! Hold on!
Austin: Yeah?
Sylvi: Doesn't that… [overlapping] turn into…
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, the 1 turns into a… [chuckles] The 1 turns into a 6!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah, hold on.
Keith: Oh, right! [laughs]
Austin: 1 turns into a 6 — that's actually an 11! So, yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Uh…
Keith: [overlapping] It's 11.
Sylvi: Siri, play 96 Quite Bitter Beings!
Dre: [imitates heavy guitar riff]
Sylvi: [imitates heavy guitar riff]
Keith: Why are there so many?
Austin: [chuckles] Uh…
Sylvi: Sorry. I'm really excited.
Austin: Are you taking… Are you taking…
Sylvi: [enthusiastically] No, I'm just putting a Risk on this guy!
Austin: Put the Risk on! [overlapping] What's this… Right.
Sylvi: [overlapping] ‘Cause there’s three of them!
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: Um, what's the… What weapon is this thing wielding?
Austin: Right now it's a… I mean… it's such a funny mirror match because…
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: … Valour has, like, a big great sword. And then otherwise has, like, the thing of shooting the little feathers off the wings.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Whoa.
Austin: [overlapping] As, like… ranged… You know what I mean? Shooting…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: Which we've talked about your mech doing very similarly. There is a real — you know — “this year's model” thing happening here. Where — you know — zig was the… the hot hero of the last, you know… generation. And the new one is here. Supplanting him.
Sylvi: Could it… I don't want to, like… I don't think. I think, fictionally, I wouldn't be able to, like, take away the weapon here — but something about, like, “clipped” as a thing…
Austin: [overlapping] God, that’s great.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Like, clipping the wings?
Austin: Oh, “clipped” is really good. Yeah. I mean…
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: That's a… “Clipped” would be a Peril and not a Risk.
Sylvi: Okay.
Austin: Because it would be…
Sylvi: Maybe “off…”
Austin: You know.
Sylvi: Maybe, like… What's, like, off balance for something that’s flying — is kind of my…?
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah… I mean, “off-balance” is pretty close.
Sylvi: [overlapping] I don't know. Would “off-balance” just be it?
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] Let’s just go with… You know. I have been doing my best… How about “lopsided”?
Dre: [overlapping] Ooh! I like that!
Sylvi: [overlapping] “Lopsided” is good. Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] You wounded one of the…
Sylvi: [overlapping] I think, like, I damaged one of the wings. I didn't completely disable them.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
Sylvi: But, like…
Austin: And it could be dealt with. [overlapping] You know, if…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: If… you know… Zig had a second to deal with it. Um. Yeah. I've been… I've been trying to be less… particular with adjectives…
Sylvi: Mm-hm.
Austin: … AKA Risks and Perils this season than, like, when we played Technoir, because that's what made it go so slow.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] So I'm happy to go with this!
Sylvi: Hell yeah.
Austin: And the second you do this a call opens up. Not from Zig, but from the Stolen Cameo — which has been uh watching this the whole time. It is, of course… the former commander / maybe more… — best friend, maybe more — Cas’alear Rizah calling you and saying:
Austin (as Cas’alear Rizah): Don't kill him. Let me talk to him.
Keith: Hmm…!
Coriolis Sunset: That's up to him.
Austin: “Him” being zig?
Sylvi: Being zig. He needs to drop all his weapons. Right? He, like, powered down…!
Austin: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: I mean, let's call this… In a way, let's call this the Strike Decisively.
Keith: Strike Decisively: Talk?
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] You slipping a little talk in there?
[01:45:00]
Austin: This is… Yeah. That's… This is…
Sylvi: Now do I still have my Advantage…?
Austin: [overlapping] No.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Like, if I roll a 1…? Okay.
Austin: You do not. And your Talk is not that good. Right?
Sylvi: No my Talk is literally nothing. [overlapping] Now… [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] Cori… Cori's a clasher not a talker.
Keith: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: I would… maybe try and worm my way into using Shifting Boon, but I don't know if that's…
Austin: [overlapping] What’s Shifting Boon let you do?
Sylvi: [overlapping] I guess I have 2 Holds now.
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: You may swap two of your Traits for the Sortie.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] But that's for the Sortie.
Austin: Yeah. That would be the whole Sortie. That's…
Keith: [overlapping] You can… 
Sylvi: [overlapping] Unless I use my other Hold to swap them back, I guess!
Austin: [overlapping] You have to then swap them back. I mean, you could shift Defy into Talk if you wanted to leave Clash. But then your Defy would be 0 — which is not great, either.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah…
Keith: [overlapping] Shift your Channel into Talk.
Austin: Oh, that's wild!
Sylvi: I don't think I can… Can I do that?
Austin: It's a Trait!
Keith: It's a trait!
Sylvi: [overlapping] But then…
Austin: [overlapping] It's very Perenniall-y! But your Channel would be 0, which is…
Sylvi: Yeah. And then I wouldn't be able to pilot my mech! [overlapping] Isn’t that how that works?
Austin: [overlapping] You could still pilot your mech! It would just be… You'd be at zero for any time I'd ask you to roll Channel, for instance.
Sylvi: Hm, hm!
Austin: Which can happen!
Keith: [overlapping] Which doesn't come up that often —
Austin: [overlapping] It doesn’t.
Keith: … unless Austin knows all of a sudden you have no Channel!
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: Exactly!
Keith: [laughs]
Sylvi: That comes up more for me, though!
Austin: I'll tell you that comes up a lot: is Consecrate Ground, for instance.
Dre: [overlapping] Uh-huh.
Sylvi: [overlapping] That's what I was going to say. I think I have used Channel more than any… like, most people here.
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: I don't know want to say “than anybody”… [overlapping] ‘Cause Thisbe used it a lot.
Janine: [overlapping] Me. I used…
Austin: [overlapping] Thisbe and you used… used it a lot.
Janine: [overlapping] I used Channel, basically…
Austin: [overlapping] All the time.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Janine: [overlapping] Anytime I'm in Mo I'm using Channel, basically! [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] You got your illusion magic. Yeah! I, like, was a mid-sentence —
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] … then I was like: “No, Thisbe's the Mage.” [chuckles]
Austin: Which, by the way…
Janine: Mm-hm.
Austin: I think — one: I advanced “Arbor project” again, it's at 5, so you're almost there on that — I think at the end of that clock you're going to need to roll Channel to do a ritual thing…
Sylvi: [overlapping] I…
Austin: [overlapping] … to make that work, Thisbe.
Janine: I'm ready.
Austin: That seems like…
Sylvi: I think I kind of, like… ‘Cause I had to… I tried doing this earlier. I tried doing the talk someone down thing.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: And it didn't work.
Austin: Yep.
Sylvi: And I kind of like that even if this doesn't work [overlapping] that being a recurring on this fight for…
Austin: [overlapping] You gotta try it again. Yeah.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: It's, like… I got a challenge levied at me where I only know how to destroy things.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: So…
Austin: Mm-hm. Um…
Sylvi: That's a 5. So…
Dre: [overlapping] Oh, no…
Austin: [overlapping] Oh my god, that's a 5. Do you still have…? God! Yeah. If only Kalmeria could power you here — that 1 would become a 6!
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: But it doesn't. It's not going to… That's not how… That is not fictionally how we have been talking about these elements working. Right?
Sylvi: Nope!
Austin: Um. You're not being powered… the Kalmeria isn't flowing through you…
Sylvi: It doesn't affect the timbre of my voice? Unless it does! In which case that's a wild thing we're introducing. Right?
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Austin: Um, so. Here is…
Sylvi: [chuckles] It’s a cool… It's Keith's mixer putting effects on Cori's voice?!?
Austin: Very… That would be very funny. Are you using Retrograde?
Sylvi: [overlapping] Oh, right!
Austin: [overlapping] You have a whole Retrograde Hold left!
Sylvi: Um… Do I… I have 1 left.
Austin: You 1 left. You could try it here…
Sylvi: “Take Advantage on a roll even after rolling.” What… Advantage is an extra dice, or…?
Austin: An extra dice. Yeah. Which is tough. You would need…
Sylvi: I rolled a 4! Like, I need a… [overlapping] 3 or higher. To get up.
Austin: [overlapping] You need 3 or higher. Which isn’t impossible!
Dre: [overlapping] Hmm…!
Keith: [overlapping] I have a… I have a question. Or not a question. I have something to, like, maybe…
Austin: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Whadup?
Keith: [overlapping] … mention is, like… Cas’alear did the speech.
Austin: Yep.
Keith: [overlapping] You know…
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, this is true!
Keith: Their part is over! They've decided to step back from history. Like… At this point we owe them nothing.
Sylvi: You know… Keith, you're making some points!
Keith: [overlapping] You know…
Austin: [overlapping] I would thought you were going a completely different place with this.
Keith: Oh. No. Like, what do… Like, what do we gain by not finishing this fight?
Sylvi: My thing is, like… my allegiance isn't necessarily to Cas’alear.
Austin: [overlapping] No, totally.
Sylvi: [overlapping] It's to Perennial.
Austin: Yep.
Sylvi: [overlapping] I…
Keith: [overlapping] I'm wondering where Austin thought I was going with.
Sylvi: [overlapping] I think…
Austin: [overlapping] I though you were going to petition for Advantage. For natural Advantage. Because one of the things that I'd said was: if Cas’alear can… can deliver this speech then there are people who are… previously allies to Cas’alear who would be sympathetic to betraying The Pact and joining Cas’alear.
Keith: Huh.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Keith: It’s interesting.
Austin: Right?
Keith: But…
Dre: It sounds like a good argument! Hey, Austin!
Austin: [laughs]
Dre: Did you know that Cas’alear gave a speech earlier?
Austin: Yeah. Uh-huh!
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: So I think that that's actually the case. Right? Like,that was one of the things — going back to the downtime episode — was, like: “Oh you… you’ll get allies from that.” Which I gave you partly through the Apostolosians arriving on your side. You know, the Mosaic True is here. And, like, there's some other Pact people here who have joined you.
Keith: Mm-hm.
Austin: But we… This is a really particular one. Right? This is a character who has specific history with Cas’alear. You have defeated Zig — or nearly defeated Zig — one-on-one in combat. Which, like, if might makes right in this person's mind even in a noble… you know, shiv… shav… [stumbles over words] blehh…! chivalric way then then you've kind of opened that door for that to work. I'm going to say you should probably just have Advantage on this.
Keith: Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Okay!
Austin: [overlapping] And give it one more d6 without having to dip into Retrograde.
Sylvi: Thank you.
Austin: Mm-hm. I mean, we'll see! It could be a 1! Who the fuck knows.
Keith: It could be a 1.
Sylvii: Don't say that…!
Austin: [overlapping] It’s a 6!
Keith: [overlapping] But it’s a 6!
Dre: [overlapping] Nice!
Austin: [overlapping] It's, of course, a 6.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Don't ever doubt me again! [chuckles]
Austin: Oh, okay. Yeah.
Sylvi: Don't ever doubt me!
Austin: Mm-hm. [overlapping] What is the compelling…
Sylvi: [overlapping] I play to win!
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: What is the thing that you say here to… to kind of… you know…
Sylvi: I think it’s…
Austin: It becomes clear, I think visually, zig is going to go down fighting and die [overlapping] in the process if you don't talk him down.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah. I… [sighs] I think the way Cori approaches this is… like… “You fought well enough.” Like, we… you know where this is going.
Austin: Hmm.
Sylvi: And I don't want to take, like… I don't want to kill you in your entire squad. You should go talk to Cas’alear — this is the best option for you and your people.
Austin: Hm.
Sylvi: Like, look out for your crew.
Austin: [overlapping] Look out… Yeah. When you…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Don't just…
Coriolis Sunset: Don't just… Don't die prideful.
Sylvi: Says Cori fucking Sunset.
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: You know. And I think we get the kind of Stratus… I mean, you have Flash. Right?
Sylvi: Yeah. This is probably how the communication happens.
Austin: Yeah. This is… These words are almost unsaid. You know? I think you say verbally: “You know how this will end”...
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: And then mentally using Flash — which is: “you may communicate with other channelers instantly over great distances in times of urgent need…”
Sylvi: Mm-hm.
Austin: “... sending words or even feelings and Sensations to help or hinder faster than anyone or anything else can act. So quickly in fact that you may do it after a role has been made.” That is… That happens here.
Sylvi: Ohhh…!
Austin: Right? Um… You…
Sylvi: Austin?
Austin: Yeah. Uh-huh?
Sylvi: For this, could it be, like… the one of the things that I let zig hear is Cas’alear's transmission to me?
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: Before I say the, like, “don't die prideful” thing?
Austin: A hundred percent. Yes.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: And hearing the urgency in Cas’alear's voice and hearing… you know, “don't die prideful”, I think, hits. And it's… it comes with the weight of the last few years you've had. Right?
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: Uh. And the… “Lopsided” clears. Um… And the Valour flies away. You know? Up and above the battlefield. You know? I can't really move up. Because that's not how…
Dre: [chuckles]
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: … 2D maps work. But, you know, kind of flies up and away. Uh… And the Stolen Cameo does, flies away with it for, you know, a second. And I think that Valour's, you know, crew kind of goes with it in a sort of defensive…
Sylvi: Mm-hm.
Austin: … non-hostile posture.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] And they're off the map for a second here.
Sylvi: Definitely something communic… Like, immediately sending a signal out to, [overlapping] like, allied ships being, like…
Austin: [overlapping] Exactly.
Sylvi: [overlapping] “Hey, they… They surrendered…”
Austin: [overlapping] They stood down.
Sylvi: [overlapping] “That that unit.”
Austin: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: Um…
Austin: Um… [overlapping] And I think…
Keith: [overlapping] All of a sudden they've noticed the horrible dripping pyramid that they've allied with.
Austin: You know…! I think…
Sylvi: I did some Goku versus Tien nonsense.
Ali: Hm…
Austin: [overlapping] That's exactly what happened. Yeah. 
Dre: [overlapping] Hmm…!
Sylvi: Listen to Media Club Plus bonus episode.
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: Please do! I think that there is a real… a thing that we don't talk about a lot is — ‘cause we don't have many… we don't have many Elects who are the main characters here. But, like, let's think about Thisbe, for instance, or Brnine — both of whom have done a lot of Divine stuff — you start hanging around with Divines, and a lot of things… Your definition of normal [half-chuckling] starts shifting pretty quickly. Right?
Keith: Mm-hm.
Austin: And it's like: “Well, why can't a big dripping battleship be worthy of our respect?” [chuckles] You know?
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: Divines are fucking weird! And if you believe in the bigger mission, it's very easy to convince yourself that the thing that looks strange is actually… And! Explicitly, it stopped doing the… When Motion took over the Ekpyrosis it stopped, like, randomly killing things. Which is what it had been doing previously after Dalia had been killed. Right? So, it seemed as if Motion had kind of fixed Commitment and what was going on there. So easy for someone like zig who wants to believe in this big mission to be like: “Well, it's everything's back on track now.” [overlapping] You know?
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. Talk about divorce!
Austin: [chuckles]
Sylvi: [laughs]
Dre: Damn.
Austin: For real.
