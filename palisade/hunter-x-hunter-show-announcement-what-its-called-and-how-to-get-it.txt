Hunter x Hunter Show Announcement: What Its Called and How to Get It
Transcriber: Daneran
Ali: Good news, everyone! I’m joined today by Keith J. Carberry.
Keith: Hi.
Ali: To announce a brand new podcast!
Keith: Yeah. In a whole new feed.
Ali: In a whole separate feed! If you can imagine that!
Keith: [half-chuckling] I hope that all of you can.
[Ali laughs]
Keith: [half-chuckling] Because if you can't this is going to be really tough!
Ali: Well, just… I… People listen to podcasts — they're listening to this right now.
Keith: Yeah.
Ali: And if they're on… like, Apple or Spotify or something of that nature, or maybe they're using like… a Podcast Addict — that's what I use on the Android to let me add RSS feeds…
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah…
Ali: [overlapping] What would I be adding to… my RSS feed, Keith?
Keith: Uh. You'd be adding Media Club Plus.
Ali: [overlapping] Oh.
Keith: [overlapping] The new podcast brought to you by Friends at the Table! You might have heard of the Hunter x Hunter podcast that we've been talking about and planning for… somewhere, like, two or four months?
[Ali chuckles]
Keith: Um… That is where that's going. It's not just gonna be a Hunter x Hunter podcast — after that's over it's gonna do… still be a podcast! Uh… With something else that comes after it!
Ali: Yeah, that's the hope!
Keith: [overlapping] I…
Ali: [overlapping] I guess we can't… I'm not gonna say right now that when Hunter x Hunter ends… two weeks later there's going to be another thing there… But I will s…
Keith: [overlapping] We would really be on top of our shit if that’s how it happened.
Ali: [overlapping, laughing] We would really. [laughs] It would be great. It would be wonderf… But I'm not gonna make that prediction for future Ali. Um… But I will say that this is an idea that has legs, and that is why we have a… I don't want to call our title generic. But it's… It's open. It's, you know, it's… 
Keith: [overlapping] It’s non-specific.
Ali: [overlapping] … gonna cover… It's non-specific. Yeah.
Keith: It's not… It doesn't say Hunter x Hunter podcast…
Ali: [overlapping] No.
Keith: [overlapping] … brought to you by Friends at the Table, because that's not what it is.
Ali: No.
Keith: That's but one… Sure, that might take… 20 months to get through…
[Ali laughs]
Ali: Yeah, y'all are doing the whole thing, right?
Keith: [overlapping] The whole thing. Yeah. It's the whole thing.
Ali: [overlapping] It’s… It's a whole show.
Keith: It’s the whole thing. I… I've had the ep… like… The week where I was like: “oh, we are absolutely crossing thirty thousand dollars a month this week”…
Ali: Uhum.
Keith: I've had the episodes mapped out since that week.
Ali: [whispering] Wow! Well.
Keith: Yeah. Yeah.
Ali: And… Well, when is it starting?
Keith: [half-chuckling] It's starting…
[Ali chuckles quietly]
Keith: In but a few days. September 5th. [overlapping] Tuesday.
Ali: [overlapping] Whoa. Uhum.
Keith: And then it's going to be released every other Tuesday until it's done.
Hey, everyone! I thought this would be a good time to interrupt myself with some clarifying updates! Obviously, you can tell now that September 5th isn't in but a few days. It is in but one day. Singular. That's because it took a few more days than we thought for the RSS feeds to get pulled into the larger RSS pool… And that's fine! Episode is tomorrow, instead of in a few days. Great! Keep a lookout for it! 
The other thing is that it still isn't searchable on a lot of Android-based apps. So the official Google Podcast app you can't search for the show in. And a handful of other ones… The app I use, BeyondPod, you can. Podcast Addict also works. But a lot of the other ones don't work. The official Google app doesn't work yet. Spotify works.
For those people who use an app that you can't search for the show in, you can go to mediaclub.plus and that will take you to the website and from there there is an RSS button in, like, this… the heading of the page… and you can just take the URL that that brings you to and add it manually into your podcast app.
 If you're at any point in the future — besides, like, literally the afternoon of… September 4th 2023 — you probably can just search for it. I think this is only going to be a problem for another day… or two. If that! Uh. Everything else I think that me and Ali say is totally still true! So back to us from the past.
Ali: [overlapping] We love that.
Keith: [overlapping] Unless something bad happens and we miss a week. 
Ali: Wow!
Keith: But so, the 5th and then the… what, the… [pauses] I already forgot the dates.
[Ali laughs]
Keith: [overlapping] The 19th! The 19th.
Ali: [overlapping, chuckling] The 5th and the 19th would be at.
Keith: Yes. And then the 3rd.
Ali: [overlapping] And then the… Yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] I knew that! I did the… I did this…! If you go to the other feed.
Ali: Uh-huh.
Keith: There's a thing up there.
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] And I knew it for then. So I'm 50-50 and that's fine.
[Ali laughs]
Ali: So, yeah. So please search Media Club Plus on your podcast app of choice… or on Google to find the RSS feed to copy and paste… from our libsyn or whatever. An RSS feed exists. The episodes exist. And the release date: September 5th.
Keith: Right. Exists. September 5th is real.
[Ali chuckles]
Ali: Wow! That's true.
Keith: Yep. And we're putting that on t-shirts.
[Ali laughs]
Keith: And you… [chuckles] And, you know, when I told people in the other… In the Episode 0 intro…
Ali: Hm.
Keith: … is that you should go to Apple Podcast and rate and review five stars the show.
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] Because it's gonna be really good. It's definitely gonna be five stars. Have you heard the screenshot thing that we did? That was so good. The whole show was that good.
Ali: Yeah. Go listen to that! And…
Keith: Yeah.
Ali: … give your honest opinion on what that is — in Apple Podcast — [overlapping] because you're gonna think that's five stars.
Keith: [overlapping] Ali. Ali! They're gonna think it's five stars! But don't give them the option!
[Ali laughs]
Keith: Don’t give them the option to do four stars! No-no-no. You go and you do five stars…
Ali: [overlapping, quietly] Wow…!
Keith: [overlapping] Even if you think it's four stars, that's the favor. That's the favor that you're doing for us. And, what the hell! If you haven't done that for Friends at the Table, why not do that, too?
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah, this is true. Uh-huh.
Keith: [overlapping] I mean, we haven't said that in years. I think. I don't think we've told people in years to review us on Apple Podcasts.
[Ali laughs]
Ali: Well, you should. You should share your opinion. Um. What else should you do as a favor to us if you enjoy Friends at the Table… or, perhaps, the existence of this Hunter x Hunter podcast?
Keith: Eh. You can go to friendsatthetable.cash and sign up for our Patreon.
Ali: You can do that. Because… This became… This is possible via the Patreon.
[pause]
Keith: Oh, yes! The Hunter x Hunter show exists because people went to Patreon, signed up on Patreon, said: “I like Friends at the Table I want to hear them do a show where they talk about other stuff.”
Ali: Uhum.
Keith: And we are able to do that because of… our supporters! It's… I mean it really is a one-to-one relationship.
[Ali laughs]
Keith: There's no abstraction there. Without that money we don't do it. [overlapping] It's simple. It's very simple.
Ali: [overlapping] Uhum. Yeah. You know.
[Keith sighs]
Ali: Um. And we're doing it. And we've been doing it. And we're gonna be doing it for…
Keith: Yeah, we've got like six episodes in the can.
Ali: That's… You know! [overlapping] That’s great!
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. Something like that. Maybe that's five. But whatever.
[Ali laughs]
Ali: And… and the first of which you can hear on September 5th! 
Keith: Yeah.
Ali: [overlapping] I love it!
Keith: [overlapping] Ehh… The second of which you can hear on September 19th.
Ali: See, you've got it.
Keith: I’ve got it. [overlapping] Yeah.
Ali: [overlapping] Look at you!
Keith: Is that it? Is there anything else?
Ali: I think that's a fine ending.
Keith: That's a fine ending.
Ali: Hm.
Keith: Okay, bye!
Ali: [laughing] Bye!
