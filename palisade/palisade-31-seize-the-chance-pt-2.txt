Recap
Austin: PALISADE is a show about empire, revolution, settler colonialism, politics, religion, war, and the many consequences thereof. For a full list of content warnings, please check the episode description.
[“Nothing is Stationary” by Jack de Quidt begins playing]
Austin: As far as you know, you want to get in there, go down, like, 20 levels, find a room, and then the big piece of intel that you got is that the thing that controls the Diadem Gravtrains… It's a piece of equipment that can be moved. It's a big piece of equipment. It's, like, the size of a small truck. But you could get it out of there and find another place in the Diadem to plug it in and still control the trains.
Eclectic Opposition: Well, I don't like flying blind, but it's better than not flying at all.
[Dre laughs]
Sylvi (as Coriolis Sunset): This guy is so cool!
Dre: I do have this cool spear, so what if I just dragoon jumped out of a ship to land on top of another mech?
Austin: Hell yeah! Yeah.
Dre: What if I did that?
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like this quite a bit. Let's do it.
Sylvi: I just want to do, like, basically, like a swoop attack on this one that I'm next to on the board.
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: You know how birds of prey will, like, dive down to grab a fish out of a river?
Austin: I do know. I do know this.
Janine: I'm ready to crunch and I'm ready to crash. Thisbe is a bit overeager right now to get into a fight.
Keith: So I really just followed this guy into the bathroom.
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvi: [bursts out laughing]
Keith: Sick. Very cool. [laughs]
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: Mm-hm.
Keith: [half-chuckling] Very awesome first thing to do is stalk a stranger—[laughs]
Austin: Uh-huh!
Keith: [laughing] On—on a whim! [laughs]
Austin: I think he coughs a little when you enter the room. 
Austin (as Suspicious Figure): [clears throat]
Keith: That's—now that's suspicious. I take back my incredulity.
Austin: Uh-huh. What do you do? Yeah.
Keith: That's a code.
Suspicious Figure: Are you taking a seat or not?
Keith: I take a seat.
Austin: You sit in the other stall. Is that—I'm guessing? Yeah?
Keith: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, not the… I'm not sharing a stall.
Austin: [laughs] And yeah, I think the camera just pans up and we see the person seated on top of the closed toilet stall, fully dressed…
Dre: Hoooh!
Austin: …holding an attaché case, is Connadine, the former leader of the Paint Shop. The head of the Bilateral Intelligence Service, here on Palisade.
Keith: I was muted but I gasped.
Sylvi: [chuckling] Mm-hm! 
Blue Channel perspective [00:03:28]
Austin: Battle time! [with slight exaggeration] Who's up, battle time?
Sylvi: I am… If no one else has anything I am happy to take out the other anti-air gun.
Janine: I do have a thing. But also…
Austin: Um…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Okay, then you go ahead.
Janine: [overlapping] I think you should probably...
Sylvi: Oh, okay!
Janine: …Take it out.
Dre: Yeah! Go for it!
Janine: Kick its ass!
Sylvi: Order of operations is better for this? Yeah, okay, cool. Uh..
Austin: Sure. Are you Striking Decisively?
Sylvi: The same as last time, so I just go straight to Decisive…? 
Austin: I mean, it's Defenseless, too. So…
Sylvi: Well…
Dre: Woof!
Austin: Yikes!
Sylvi: I missed. [overlapping] I rolled a 6.
Dre: [overlapping] What happens when you miss on a Strike Decisive?
Austin: How did you even… I guess, yeah. Your Clash is only +2. “When you miss…”
Sylvi: I think I… 
Austin: Go ahead!
Sylvi: The… Yeah. Go ahead. I was going to say, like, how does she do that? She, like, probably overshot or something. [chuckles]
Austin: That, I think, is exactly right. Um, I think that this is a classic “more of a hand grenade than a bullet” or whatever. Um. And you don't communicate this well — what you're about to do — and you end up charging directly into Popcorn—
Sylvi: [overlapping] No!
Austin: [overlapping] —and knock Popcorn away. Ali, I need you to take a Risk about being, like, you know, your team is confused or is out of whack. You know what I mean?
Ali: Sure. Yeah.
Austin: So, yeah. That's a… you just hard— you hard missed. And, I think, Cori, you should also take a Risk here. Since you also failed the actual roll.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: You take the Risk… You take a Risk from the same thing, right? You've run into one of your friends. You've missed the attack that you had.
Sylvi: [overlapping] “Disoriented”?
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. “Disoriented” works. And I think, also, as you miss, this gun has gone into, with its, it's Defenseless now. And it's unguarded. But it's gone into, like, autofire mode? And it starts shooting at you. And, you know. You're not high up! And so it's just, like, loud flak cannon fire exploding all around. And it's just, like, it is “disorienting” here.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Austin: So. Yeah. Go ahead and take that.
[pause]
Austin: [overlapping] And I'll Advance it to 1.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Okay. I got it.
Austin: Boom.
Sylvi: Yeah. I could reroll this, but I want to save my “decisive” tag for…
Austin: Sure. Something bigger than this? Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] …Later on in the Sortie.
Austin: [overlapping] That makes sense.
Sylvi: Yeah, not a necessarily a two…
Austin: Sure.
Sylvi: …Level.
Austin: Thisbe, you said you had something.
Janine: Yeah. Um. So, I figured out… I figured out the things that I messed up and fixed them.
Austin: Oh! Okay.
Janine: I've picked a Move. [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] Okay. Is the thing…
Janine: [overlapping] And I have picked a clock.
Austin: Okay. You picked a — wait, you picked a what?
Janine: [overlapping] A Brnine-clock.
Austin: [overlapping] Oh a clock for Brnine! What's your Brnine-clock?
Janine: “Brnine is capable but brittle. Their success and survival is the only way forward.”
Austin: [overlapping] Damn.
Ali: [overlapping] Damn!
Sylvi: Go.
Austin: Yeah. Protect your friends. [overlapping] Protect your brittle friends.
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah.
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: Your brittle but capable friends! I'm not, you know? Yeah.
Janine: Mm-hmm. Mm-hm.
Sylvi: You know what, I have a lot of those!
Austin: Mm-hm. 
Ali: Mm.
Dre: Yeah!
Austin: Same. I am one of those, I like to think. Um.
Ali: Yeah.
Sylvi: I think so.
Janine: [overlapping] And I would like to use…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Sorry about the brittle part!
Janine: I would like to use the Move I took.
Austin: Okay. Sure.
Janine: Um.
Austin: Yeah, this is good. You gonna read this one?
Janine: It's really good!
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Janine: “Tactical Illusions: When you distract your foes with magic, roll +Channel. On a 10+ choose two, on a 7-9 choose one, but your illusions also distract an unintended audience.”
Austin: Okay.
Janine: So.
Austin: Let's get some cool magic going!
Janine: Yes. This is, I think… Again, the natural extension of, like, I've painted this as Thisbe unintentionally just, like, wanting things so strongly that the way that magic is [chuckles] amplifies them and sort of brings them into reality.
Austin: Yeah.
Janine: I think she's becoming more aware of it. Right? Like.
Austin: Sure.
Janine: And can… Is now sort of getting into a mind space of like: “well, what if I just try to think about something really wild?” [chuckles]
Austin: Mm-hm.
Janine: “Will that happen, too?” Um…
Austin: “Will I be able to summon things into reality?”
Janine: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah. And what is it you're trying to summon here?
Janine: So… I mean, importantly, it's an illusion. Right?
Austin: Yes, yes.
Janine: But I think the thing that Thisbe is trying to do is she is trying to conjure the illusion of, like, a massive troop transport ship in the sky.
Austin: [chuckles] Oh, sure! Yeah. A classic maneuver.
Janine: Um. Probably… I don't know if it would… I don't know what group she would assign it to, but it would, I mean, it would have to look Millennium Break-y. [overlapping] Or, like, Hexagon-y. You know?
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. Totally.
Janine: Um.
Austin: Yeah, yeah.
[pause]
Austin: [overlapping] Alright.
Janine: [overlapping] So she's trying to — yeah — to conjure this basically in the sky overhead, to distract.
[pause]
Austin: Alright. Let's give me the roll!
Janine: I'll give you the roll!
Austin: 2d6 plus 3.
[pause]
Austin: [sighs]
Janine: It's a 9! [chuckles]
Austin: That is a 9. “On a 7 to 9 choose one, but your illusions also distract an unintended audience.”
Janine: Umm… Okay. So my choices here are: “the illusions last until you stop sustaining them; your illusions affect anyone you intend to perceive them rather than a single person; or, you can create illusions that affect all the senses rather than just sight.”
Austin: Mm-hm.
Janine: I'm going to go with “your illusions affect anyone you intend to perceive them”.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Janine: Um. Because I want the… [chuckles] I want the enemies [overlapping] to all see big spaceship.
Austin: [overlapping] To all see the big thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally.
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah. And also that makes it… it also makes sense of, like, distracting an unintended audience…
Austin: Yes.
Janine: If Thisbe’s overreaching in this way [overlapping] of course she’s gonna catch someone else.
Austin: [overlapping] This is exactly what happens. Yeah. Exactly. I mean, I think… [chuckles] Yeah. You know… You see it appear. I think all of the enemies here take the Risk… They take the Risk “outnumbered”, even though they are not outnumbered — because they're acting as if they are. You know? Which I think makes every remaining thing Defenseless. Uh… ‘Cause they've all taken it.
Ali: Hm!
Austin: Then you hear the alarms from throughout Carmathen, as everyone in the city looks up and sees the arrival of Millennium Break ships.
Janine: Uh-oh. [chuckles]
Dre: [laughs loudly]
Janine: Thisbe brainpower too strong!
Ali: [chuckles uncomfortably]
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Thisbe brainpower too strong!
Janine: She went too hard! The second she was like: “what if I do it on purpose?”
Austin: [laughs]
Janine: “What if I really commit to this?” It's just like: [chuckling] “oh, everyone… thinks a giant spaceship is here to kill them.” Good stuff. Good work.
Austin: Uh-huh! Yeah.
Sylvi: What happens when you work out too much at the library!
[Austin & Janine laugh]
Austin: [laughing] Yeah! Exactly! Uh, Thisbe with the big brain meme, great!
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: Um. Figure! Let's hop over to you.
Dre: Yeah. [overlapping] Umm…
Austin: [overlapping] How are you doing?
Dre: I'm good! I guess I’ll… I guess I'll Strike Decisively here!
Austin: Yeah! [overlapping] I think it's time!
Dre: [overlapping] Umm…
[pause]
Dre: I have a question, Austin.
Austin: Sure.
Dre: Um. So both of these two — I could Strike Decisively on either one.
Austin: You could do either one! Sure.
Dre: Umm… My weap… my cannon that I have is “area”.
Austin: Okay.. You could — yeah. Uh-huh!
Dre: Okay.
Austin: You want to try to, like, hop backwards while they're distracted by the arrival of the Millennium Break… the “arrival” quote-unquote of the Millennium Break ship and then fire the big cannon shots?
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Austin: I mean, here's the other thing — to really sell this real quick — you're from a ship that appears from nowhere. So, like, they think that that's a thing you do all the time, ‘cause it is!
Dre: [overlapping] Sure.
Austin: [overlapping] You do appear from magic ships all the time that appear from nowhere from a cloaking device — so the arrival of Millennium Break ships all of the sudden is not that surp — is surprising to them, but they're not… No one's in disbelief of it, because of that. So yeah. You get a moment here to jump back and get them into AOE range. [overlapping] If you'd like to try! Give me a Strike Decisively! 
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah! Yeah. Sure.
Austin: I'll note, this is also “ruin” and “messy”.
Dre: Uh-huh!
Austin: “Ruin” is not going to come into handy here because they're the same tier as you.
[someone coughs]
Austin: But "messy" could…
Dre: "Messy" could!
Austin: Uh-huh! What type of… What type of weapon is this? I mean, it's “Profane” but, like, what's it look or sound or feel like—
Dre: [sighs]
Austin: —When you try to attack [overlapping] with this thing?
Dre: [overlapping] I'm still trying to figure out, like, a name for it.
Austin: Sure.
Dre: But I mean, it's… It's big. It's loud, it is… It is scary. It is not subtle. [pauses] I'm trying to think of, like, what it actually fires.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Dre: I mean, yeah. What is… What does weaponized Perennial Energy look like?
Austin: It can be a lot of things. Right? Like, this is, if you remember, Motion used to control the Perennial Wave.
Dre: Mm-hm.
Austin: Um. You know? I think as tight to the Motion signifiers as we've ever seen are things like “oh, Russian sage starts sprouting somewhere.” Right? But we've also seen, again, Teasel Mode used a Perennial gun ages ago and it just, like, made people into blood. [chuckles] If I remember right. Janine?
Janine: Um.
Austin: Do you recall this? Or it shot… blood…?
Janine: I don't remember what the… [overlapping] I remember hurting people's blood.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah, hold on. You sent me…
Janine: …But I don't remember what the gun did. Vis-a-vis blood.
Dre: You sent me some of this, Austin.
Austin: I think I did.
Dre: [overlapping] Let me see if I can find it.
Austin: What you said, Janine, was: “Uh, anyway. The thing I wanted to do was to mess with someone's blood.”
Ali: [laughs]
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] And then it's “Austin: [sigh, Dre laughing in the background] Heads up for body horror for whatever is about to happen”, I say. [chuckles]
Janine: See, this is why I thought we could get away with a t-shirt just full a nasty shit [chuckles] I've said.
Austin: [bursts out laughing]
Dre: Mm-hm.
Austin: Um.
Dre: Yeah, you said it is like when you put paint in a pan “and it'll be really smooth and nice, but then it dries out and it cracks and it gets all chunky.” And that's what your gun did to blood.
Austin: [overlapping] Jesus Christ!
Janine: [overlapping] Okay, so, like, dries up and thickens the blood.
Sylvi: [overlapping] [quietly] That’s so cool! That’s so cool!
Dre: Uh-huh! Yeah.
Austin: Uh-huh.
Dre: I don't think it does that!
[laughter from all]
Austin: No!
Janine: [loudly] Coward!
Ali: [chuckle]
Austin: [overlapping] Okay, the actual…
Janine: [overlapping] You invoke Teasel Mode, and yet!
[Austin & Dre laugh]
Austin: The things that fire out of the Teasel Mode gun originally were — you described them as being… You shoot out paper streamy things to do some streamer-y stuff. But then you tilt the gun forward like a mortar and shoot the magic out of that. I… Don't ask me.
Dre: Mm.
Austin: So my point being Perennial has had a lot of… And then we have their guns, which use Perennial magic, but they just shoot bullets. Right? They just shoot, like, energy bullets. Like, pink energy bullets or something. You know? Much more boring than…
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: …Either of our other current options. [amused] So you have a range here, Dre. You tell me what you want.
Dre: [loudly sighs]
[pause]
Keith: I think you should try to one-up gross the blood thing.
Dre: [laughs]
Austin: [intensely, like a horror movie title] Gross: The Blood Thing
Dre: Gross: The Blood Thing. So, what if this is a thing that…
[someone chuckles in the background]
Dre: … it doesn't one-up gross the blood thing…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Gross: The Blood Thing.
Dre: [overlapping] …But it does… it does… [sighs] It's like an EMP, but worse?
Austin: [overlapping] Uh-huh.
Dre: And that it can both disrupt systems but will also, like, physically ruin things?
Austin: Sure.
Dre: EMP for mech skin! Janine, how about that?
Austin: EMP for mech skin.
Janine: [overlapping] [unimpressed] Ehh… It’s fine, I guess!
Austin: So, like, is it boiling the metal? Like, what's it doing? [overlapping] You were sayin’…?
Dre: [overlapping] Oh yeah! I like boiling metal!
[00:15:00]
Dre: Yes.
Austin: [chuckles] Okay.
Dre: Uh-huh.
Austin: Dre likes boiling metal, everybody!
Dre: Yeah! [overlapping] Yeah, to drink!
Austin: [overlapping] So it's like an energy blast… It's like a blast that then the metal melts and boils in an area of effect.
Dre: Sure.
Austin: Love it. Great. Or the material it hits.
Dre: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Austin: [overlapping] ‘Cause maybe it won't just — it's messy, it doesn't just hit one thing.
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: Alright! Give me a Strike Decisively!
Dre: And that is also… that's Clash as well, right?
Austin: That is Clash! [overlapping] For doing it like this, yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: And your Clash, again, is 2. So… And you still have Advantage from Cold Company.
Dre: Mm-hm.
Austin: So 3d6 plus 2.
Dre: [overlapping] Uh, so…
Austin: [overlapping] I can't believe this fucking three 6s thing is going to have me on edge every time you roll!
Dre: Yeah. It's great. What are you talking about?
Austin: Uh-huh.
Dre: Uhhh… Silvi brought up Elemental stuff, and I…
Austin: Yes.
Dre: [overlapping] … do not remember.
Austin: [overlapping] You are Profane. They are Profane.
Dre: Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] So you zero, yeah…
Dre: [overlapping] So that doesn’t…
Austin: No problem here.
Dre: Okay.
Keith: The best thing about the 6s thing is that…
Dre: [bursts out laughing]
Austin: Bruh.
Keith: [overlapping] Is that you…?
Ali: [overlapping] No.
Austin: [overlapping] I can’t do this!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Oh, no!
Ali: [overlapping] No fucking way. We can’t do this.
Austin: Dre just rolled 6, 6, 5. We have to roll two 6s. You have to roll two 6s…
Keith: It is two, right? [overlapping] Yeah. Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] It’s every time!
Sylvi: [laughs]
Ali: [overlapping] Wait, what? Wait. No, wait.
Austin: [overlapping] Now wait a second! Now wait a second! You could get both 6s and then you're safe! Right? ‘Cause then you will have rolled four! [overlapping] I'm rereading this move.
[others vocalize disbelief]
Keith: [overlapping] Is that true?
Janine: [overlapping] I don’t…
Ali: [bursts out laughing]
Keith: It might hit three and then trigger immediately [overlapping] — is how I read it.
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] It feels like a loophole!
Austin: [overlapping] It does say “if you ever roll three 6s”.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] It doesn't say “exactly three…” It doesn't say…
Janine: [overlapping] I would assume — from “if you ever roll three 6s” — it's, like, three in one roll.
Austin: No. It’s not.
Dre: No.
Keith: [overlapping] If you… If you go back… and…
Austin: [overlapping] It’s what… Because it says… Janine, it says “in one Move.”
Janine: Ohhh!
Austin: It says “during one Move”.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah. Yeah.
Janine: [overlapping] Okay, okay.
Austin: ‘Cause, explicitly, the thing it does is get… let you reroll your… add an extra dice for every… “Whenever you roll a 6, roll an additional die”...
Janine: [overlapping] Right…!
Dre: [overlapping] Hooohhh!
Austin: [overlapping] … “and add it to the total.”
Janine: [overlapping] Alright, you’ve got a 1.
Austin: [overlapping] I guess that's a question…
Keith: [overlapping] If you go…
Austin: So that's my question. Do you only have to roll one… extra one here?
Dre: Yeah! I think so!
Austin: You don't get to roll two extra dice? Because…
Dre: Ohhh…!
Austin: … the additional roll… The initial roll was a roll with a 6 in it — versus…
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: [sighs] I'm gonna check the Discord [overlapping] real quick, because this did come up!
Keith: [overlapping] It’s ambiguous.
Ali: Right.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keith: If you listen back you can hear that I was about to talk about that I felt that it was about to… happen.
Ali: [chuckles]
Keith: Right before Dre freaked out at [chuckles] the getting the two 6s?
Austin: Mm-hm.
Ali: [sighs]
Keith: Oh, that's a 1? [overlapping] Is that… Is that your…
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah. That… I rolled a 1.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah, yeah. That’s what we're… I'm now double-checking… to make sure.
Dre: [overlapping] I’m safe for now!
Austin: Well. Again, I'm double checking to make sure you don't have to roll [overlapping] for both 6s. Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] Another one? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Austin: Exactly. Alright. I think the way we should run this is this: if you're going to use the first part of this Move which is whenever you roll a 6, roll additional dice… an additional die, rather, and add it to the total for that roll, then whenever you do that, any 6s you roll in that roll count towards three 6s. ‘Cause you've taken the bonus. So if you rolled with Desperation — which changes 6s into 1s — and you roll 6s, and they become 1s, those are 6s.
Ali: Mm-hm.
Austin: Right? Uh… A single roll…
Sylvi: [overlapping] [half-chuckling] You fail the roll and blow up!
Austin: [overlapping] And blow up! I mean, you know. If a single roll that has multiple 6s in it… is still only a roll with a 6 in the sense of it triggers one. I don't think — for instance, you rolled 6, 6, 5 here — I don't think you have to roll two new 6s. I think that's too dangerous.
[pause]
Austin: [overlapping] You know what I mean?
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: The thing that I'm not a hundred percent on is, if you roll a 1… Sorry. If you roll a — yeah. If you roll a 1 in… [overlapping] Confidence and it becomes a 6.
Keith: [overlapping] Confidence?
Austin: At that point I don't think you've rolled a 6.
Dre: No. Yeah.
Ali: Mm-hm.
Austin: Right? I think that that is different. [overlapping] And so…
Keith: [overlapping] I think it… I think that has to be true if we're doing the same thing for Conf — for rolling with… Uh…
Austin: Desperation…
Keith: [overlapping] Desperation.
Austin: [overlapping] It does count as a 6.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Correct.
Keith: Oh, it does? [overlapping] Oh. Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] ‘Cause it's a… You rolled a 6!
Ali: [overlapping] Right. Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] If you roll a 6, you roll a 6.
Keith: Oh, right. Yeah. [overlapping] This what I’m sayin’.
Austin: [overlapping] Right? Yeah.
Keith: Yeah. It’s the…
Austin: [overlapping] 6s from Con… Right. Yeah. Exactly.
Keith: [overlapping] It is the same logic and it's not the same roll.
Austin: So 6s from Confidence don't count as rolling a 6. [overlapping] I'm adding all of this text here.
Keith: [overlapping] It's about the roll, not about what it ends up as after it gets… Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] That is correct. I'm adding all of this somewhere on your sheet, Dre.
Dre: Okay. 
Austin: Maybe inside of Notes or something.
Keith: But the real thing is that this move is… was, by a razor-thin margin, Dre is safe.
Austin: Correct. [overlapping] In this moment, Dre…
Keith: [overlapping] And not dead.
Austin: Well, yeah. Dre rolled 6, 6, plus 5… 6, 6, 5. You take the 6s, you reroll… or you add another dice and it's a 1. So.
Dre: [overlapping] Mm-hm. Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] That's 6 plus 6 plus 2.
Dre: [overlapping] And I'm not rolling another si… another dice.
Austin: [overlapping] And you're not rolling another dice from that second 6.
Dre: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: Unless — and I mean, again: I'm happy to say that's how it works, but that is how it will always work, Dre!
Dre: Sure.
Austin: So you make a decision.
Dre: Uhhh… No, thank you!
Austin: Okay.
[pause]
Austin: And, like, that makes sense. Right? That's the safe play, because if you have… if you've rolled multiple 6s you've probably succeeded! You don't need them both to…
Dre: Yeah. Yeah.
Keith: Right.
Austin: You would need to have, like, a -5 or something order for that to not be…
Keith: Literally… the only reason is if you're daring the game to kill you.
Austin: Exactly. Right. Which, you took the Move! So. I don't know. Anyway! You are Striking Decisively on both of these mechs.
Dre: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Austin: [overlapping] What's it look like when you do that?
Dre: Uhhhh… [sighs] Woofff. I think… big eruption of, like, it's not flame but it looks like flame? It's light, but it, like, licks around the edge of the cannon the way, like, flame licks around the edge of stuff. 
Austin: Yeah!
Dre: Um… Just completely obliterates both these mechs and then also probably a sizable chunk of the area where they were standing.
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: We — man! We keep talking about Gundam Wing! But I mean, like, you know.
Austin: You know!
Sylvi: [overlapping] Good show.
Dre: When Wing Gundam shoots the big beam cannon.
Austin: Yup.
Dre: And everything is gone. Including a chunk of the ground.
Austin: Yeah. I do know. Let me tell you! I do know.
Dre: Mm-hm!
Austin: I was thinking about Gundam Wing today. Uh… We did, over on the Great Gundam Project… [chuckles]
Dre: [overlapping] [intrigued] Oohhhh…!
Austin: [overlapping] I guested and did the second…
Dre: Was this the draft?
Austin: … draft. Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] [hoarsely] Yeaahhh!
Austin: [overlapping] The pilot draft for all the AUs. And I got every little broken child on my ship. So.
Dre: Hell yeah.
Ali: Wow!
Austin: You gotta go listen to The Great Gundam Project for that. Anyway! Well, they're gone. And so is a big part of the wall here. So I'll add, like, some… I'll add, like, a little red bit. Well, that's the whole thing turned red. That's not what I wanted. [chuckles]
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: I'll add a little red bit to the wall to indicate that you've also just broken a huge chunk of this wall. Boom. You know? From the explosion. Which, again, isn't even an explosion! I like that this thing is, like, it just melts stuff. You know? Which is scarier to me than if it went, like, [exaggeratedly] BOOOOM! You know? And there was fire and stuff. But just, like, maybe there's a sound but then visually it’s just: those mechs melted. [chuckles] You know? Very scary. Uh, who has not gone on this side? Brnine, have you not gone?
Ali: I have not gone. Um…
Austin: You have not gone.
Ali: I'm of two minds here.
Austin: Uh-huh.
Ali: I think the…. The gun is open for Strike Decisively…
Austin: [overlapping] It is.
Ali: [overlapping] But I still want to figure out a way narratively to, like, not destroy it? But…
Austin: You could Strike Decisively and try to hack it!
Ali: [overlapping] Okay. Okay. That works for me. Uhh… Then I…
Austin: [overlapping] I think that's a way of Striking Decisively. Yeah. It would be Decisive.
Ali: I think that I will do that.
Austin: Okay.
Ali: [chuckles] I think part of that is… I didn't read my Gravity Clocks before.
Austin: Oh, you didn't! We need to do those. Yeah.
Ali: Right. The one that I have with Cori is — now that my clock with Cori is +2 — is: “Try to teach Cori when to stop and think.”
Austin: Ahh! Sure!
Sylvi: [laughs]
Austin: Well! [overlapping] What just happened, happened!
Ali: [overlapping] I’ll not be doing that by example, I suppose.
Austin: Um, no!
Ali: [chuckles] But I think this is a moment of where, like…
Austin: Honestly, you should go up! You should take one more to that. That should go up to — that should have just advanced because of the thing that happened where Cori slammed into…
Ali: Oh, when anyone rolls 6 or below while rolling Crew?
Austin: No. No, just in general. When you are doing things with someone you have a Gravity Clock with, and a player gets hurt or you’ve rolled Help with people or stuff like that, that can cause the thing to go up. Right?
Ali: Oh.
Austin: Am I not… Am I remembering this wrong? Let's see. Tudu-dudu-duh… Oh okay. You know what it is? That's if you Help or Hinder, specifically. [overlapping] You…
Ali: [overlapping] Oh, sure.
Austin: You advance it or you change it. And yeah. If you Exchange Blows, you can also Advance a Gravity Clock if you do that with someone that you have a Gravity Clock with. Which, that isn't what happened here. But I think that hitting someone while trying to Strike Decisively and hitting them is basically the same thing as Exchanging Blows with them.
Ali: [laughs] Okay.
Austin: You know?
Ali: I’ll happily bring that up to 2.
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: [overlapping] But yeah. I can…
Austin: [overlapping] Which means Cori, you should, too.
Ali: I think… Brnine here is saying over the comms, like:
Ali (as Kalvin Brnine): Cori, remember we — we wanted to hack the thing! You know? Give Midnite backup while she… connects the signal.
Coriolis Sunset: Oh. Okay. Yeah! So I won't break it! [pause] Right!
Sylvi: Oops.
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Give me your Crew roll to see if Midnite can hack it!
Ali: Sure. Su-su-sure.. Okay. This is a roll 2d6 plus 3, again?
Austin: 2d6 plus 3.
Ali: That's a 10.
Austin: Alright. Strike Decisively. It is Struck Decisively. What do you… What's it look like as you hack it — or as Midnite hacks it for you?
Ali: Uhhm. Yeah. I think it's a… Mmm… Maybe this is, like, a get out and try to go into the tower situation?
Austin: Mm-hm. Sure. You go into the, like, not the cockpit of it. But the firing place. But then what do you do with it? So you have it, you just shut it down? You just keep it… Do you keep it on? Do you… Is this where Midnite is going to go… Midnite is going to stay in it now and, like, fire it?
Ali: I think, maybe. Yeah. I…
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: So I was wondering if there… Because this isn't, like, the base for this whole thing or whatever.
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: But, like, a way to, like… Um… You know, shoot at people if they approach.
Austin: Yep.
Ali: Or even, like, try to get… I don't know that it's hacky enough to, like, get information about the Gravtrain or stuff like that?
Austin: No, I don't think there's anything like that in this gun. [overlapping] You know?
Ali: [overlapping] Okay. Sure.
Austin: Like, notably this gun is on the outside of the wall.
Ali: [chuckling] Uh-huh!
Austin: Which is to say, like, it is here to defend this place. Right? But it is not literally on the same, like, network as this place is. This thing has been, like, kind of hastily put here in place of the previous Stel Kesh defenses that were here.
Ali: Okay.
Austin: They really, like, brought this thing out. Maybe Midnite even calls this back up to you. And is like:
Austin (as Midnite Matinee): They just pulled this thing out of mothballs, chief! This thing barely works.
Austin: And, you know, does go through, like, the quick run of… the quick rundown to make sure that she knows how to use it.
Ali: Mm-hm.
Austin: And her… Her hollow, Popcorn, is an auto-hollow — which means it can go into like, you know, again, Titanfall-style auto mode. And it goes on defense mode here. Kind of making sure that she'll be safe inside. And that leaves us with the truck at the bottom and the Bouquet. Both of which are Defenseless. Uh, Cori or Thisbe — who's over there — Thisbe, you don't need to, like, [chuckles] maintain concentration for this. Right?
Janine: No. Unless I pick the…
Dre: [laughs]
Janine: Unless I pick the… “last until I stop sustaining them” thing, they last up to a minute.
Austin: [overlapping] Okay.
Janine: [overlapping] So I figure after I take a Move they'll probably disappear.
Austin: That makes sense. Yep!
Janine: Um…
Austin: I don't think we've gone through more than a minute of actual action here. [overlapping] Even though we’ve talked for 40 minutes or whatever.
Janine: [overlapping] No. I… The way I was thinking about that was, like, there's no way that she cast this and then counted to 60 before doing anything. So…
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: No. Exactly. Yes.
Janine: Yeah.
Ali: Ca…
Janine: Um… [overlapping] Yeah?
Ali: [overlapping] Can I read the rest of my stuff?
Janine: [overlapping] Oh!
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, yes, please! Sorry, I forgot that we…
Ali: Yeah…
Janine: [chuckles]
Austin: [overlapping] … stopped in the middle to finish that scene!
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: [overlapping] Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!
Ali: So I have another Gravity Clock, which is “I want to understand Lattice.” That might change soon.
Austin: [overlapping] Hm. Uh-huh.
Ali: [overlapping] We'll talk about that after. I still don't have a thing for Thisbe that I've written. Because… I'm interested in the Clock as a player. But I feel like Brnine has sort of, like, tried to make a connection with Thisbe and, like, sort of feels like they haven't?
Austin: Mmm.
Ali: And I don't know how to…
Janine: [objecting] But…! Eh…! Mm…!
Ali: [laughs]
Janine: But in the Downtime Thisbe was all, like: “I'll help you. I'll help you. I'm good at this.”
Ali: No! No, I know! No, I know.
Austin: Wow. Wow.
Dre: [overlapping] Wow, wow, wow, wow, woww.
Janine: [overlapping] Geez…!
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Shoe's on the other foot now!
Ali: Right. I'm trying to, like, think of a way to, like… [overlapping] signal…
Janine: [overlapping] Also, you can't take this clock away from me! It's, like, the only way I level up! [chuckles]
Austin: [chuckles]
Ali: No-no-no.
Dre: [compassionately] Awww…
Ali: Wai… Wait a sec. Narratively. But like, I want it to feel like it's a Clock that's still active, but that, like, the sentence should, like, communicate some, like, disinvestment?
Austin: Hmmmm!
Ali: Um. So I don't know. We'll see how that plays out. And I’m… [chuckles] Anyway! My Hooks are: “The crew put their faith in me so I must prioritize their safety.”
Austin: Mm-hm.
Ali: I have a new Hook which is: “I'm living on borrowed time. Keep up their fight.” And my third Hook is — via my Divine, Asepsis: “Verify the integrity of anybody… [overlapping] you let on the ship.” [chuckles]
Austin: Ahhh! The integrity of anyo… Hey!
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Where'd you put it?
Ali: Um. No. Integrity is in a… a glass tank, [overlapping] probably more of a…
Austin: [overlapping] That's what I thought! In one of the Asep… Asepsis tanks.
Keith: [overlapping] In a jar. Yeah. The spine… Yeah. Spine Jar!
Austin: It's in the spine jar. Yeah.
Ali: Yeah.
Austin: It's changed shape, by the way.
Ali: I bet. [laughs]
Austin: It is… a scepter, now.
Ali: A scepter.
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: Still on the spine? Still connected to the spine?
Austin: [overlapping] I don’t know! Not connected to anything!
Janine: [overlapping] Is that like an Asepsis with a mister? Like, a mister…
Austin: No.
Ali: Huh?
Sylvi: Booo! [laughs]
Janine: [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: No. It is… [overlapping] It is a scepter.
Janine: [overlapping] Ascepter?
Austin: Like… Uh-huh.
Sylvi: [quietly] God…
Austin: It is a scepter the way— you know — like, a king would have a scepter. You know?
Ali: Sure. Cool. Need a bigger box, probably.
Austin: It's not, like, tall, necessarily. It's the same…
Ali: [giggles]
Austin: … the same scale as the spine was — it just straightened out and has become a sort of, you know, a symbol of royal power.
Ali: Cool.
Austin: Uh-huh.
Dre: [chuckles]
Ali: I truly do not have any long-term Integrity–Asepsis plans.
Austin: [quietly chuckles]
Ali: But I did bold the word “integrity” in this Hook now!
Austin: Great.
Ali: So…
Austin: Uh-huh.
Ali: Let's see what happens.
Austin: You know, Asepsis definitely has it on lockdown in a way where it's, like…
Ali: [appreciatively] Mmm!
Austin: Kind of, like, when you bring a new animal into a house. You know what I mean? The pet… [overlapping] The old pet is like: “I'm the pet.”
Keith: [overlapping] Yup.
Ali: Mm-hm!
Janine: Oh, this is like kitten in the bedroom…
Ali: [giggles]
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Janine: [overlapping] You have kitten locked in one bedroom and the house…
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Cat…
Janine: [overlapping] The house cat’s rowing around and, like, sniffing under the door?
[00:30:00]
Keith: [overlapping] Oh, you know…
Janine: [overlapping] “What’s this thing here?”
Austin: [overlapping] Sniffing on the door!
Ali: Asepsis needs to get used to [overlapping] the smell of Integrity I think, yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] “Hey, what’s up with this thing?”
Keith: You gotta to keep a goldfish in the baggie of old water [overlapping] before you put it in the new water.
Ali: Uh-huh…!
Austin: Yeah. [overlapping] Uh-huh.
Keith: [overlapping] Or it'll die.
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: Uh-uh. Um…
[pause]
Keith: We got loads of metaphor for this.
Ali: Can I clear this “targeted” Risk since we've…
Austin: Yes. That Risk should be gone! Um. Yeah. I think… Figure, you didn't take any Risks during that. Right?
Dre: [overlapping] U-um.
Austin: [overlapping] And Thisbe, I think you’re still “amped”. [chuckles] I think. And I think Cori, you’re still “disoriented”, for the moment. You know? Give it a… Give it another beat and it'll clear. How are we dealing with this Bouquet and this remaining tank thing?
Janine: I want to smash the Bouquet.
Austin: Smash that Bouquet! [overlapping] Give me a… 
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: … Strike Decisively! With Clash. Is this just “Mow big”? Is this being Mow… Mow was doing big…? [overlapping] Big boy stuff?
Janine: [overlapping] Yeah. I think this is, like, what Thisbe tried to do before but it's, like, more targeted?
Austin: Sure.
Janine: It is… [chuckles] I'm kind of imagining, like, a robot neck-chop?
Austin: Sure.
Janine: [chuckling] Kind of thing?
Sylvi: [laughs]
Dre: Hmm.
Austin: Yeah.
Janine: I'm just, like… I just want to… “Maybe I'll break this off! Maybe I won't! I don't… Maybe I'll break something important! Let's go for it.”
Austin: Yeah. Alright. 2d6 plus 2!
Janine: That's a 6. That's a no-go.
Austin: [chuckling] That is a no-go! They're really holding out here! And I, you know… Sorry, if someone was going to say something?
Ali: I was, like, looking if I had stuff to…
Austin: Um…
Ali: [overlapping] But I’ll remember to do that later.
Austin: [overlapping] You could Aid or Assist!
Ali: Oh, okay! Yeah!
Austin: Remember? There’s all these other moves.
Ali: [overlapping] Oh, we can do that after the fact, yeah. I would like to do that.
Austin: Yeah. Uh-huh. You could Help Or Hinder… “When you Help Or Hinder someone and influence their attempts to do something, roll plus one if: you spent meaningful time together before the Sortie” — you have, [overlapping] so plus one at least.
Ali: [overlapping] Hmm.
Austin: “If they've Helped Or Hindered you previously” — that has not happened yet. “If they're part of one of your Hooks” — they're part of the crew. Right? So they are.
Ali: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Austin: So plus… 2d6 plus 2 would give Thisbe Advantage.
Ali: Would love to. Um. What is the… Oh, the Advantage would change… the 1 to a si… [overlapping] No. That's not in this.
Austin: [overlapping] No, it would give… It would give Thisbe another die to roll.
Ali: [overlapping] What am I rolling again, I’m sorry.
Austin: [overlapping] It’d be 3d… 2d6 plus 2. Nope!
Janine: [bursts out laughing]
Austin: Wow!
Janine: [laughing] [overlapping] That's the same roll!
Austin: [overlapping] That’s also a 6. It's the same roll.
Ali: [laughs]
Janine: It’s the exact same roll!
Austin: BFF mode has just happened.
Janine: [overlapping] Wow!
Keith: [overlapping] What are the odds!
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Sylvi: [overlapping] Wow…
Janine: What a wavelength we're sharing!
Austin: If you go down I'm going down with you! This is… Yeah. Um…
Sylvi: Brnine rides with Thisbe!
Dre: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Brnine rides with Thisbe. 
[pause]
Austin: Um… [chuckles] [pause] I know what happens here. It's just not… I thought a small thing was gonna happen here and then a big thing happens here instead.
Ali: Mm-hm.
Austin: You know how this wall in the Northeast was… blown apart by Figure’s… big explosion thing? A moment ago?
Ali: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Dre: [overlapping] Hmm.
Austin: Well, now the whole thing is blown away.
Ali: [gasps]
Austin: Not by Figure. But by a huge sort of plasma blast coming from below. Um…
Ali: [chortles]
Janine: [overlapping, skeptically] Hm…
Austin: [overlapping] It singes…
Dre: [overlapping] Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.
Austin: … you, Thisbe.
Ali: [chortles]
Austin: So take singed or, you know… It almost burns you and Mow. You know?
Janine: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Austin: [overlapping] It almost completely, you know, kills you.
Janine: [overlapping] How about “scorched?”
Austin: [overlapping] If you were, like, three steps over to the right? Scorched is fine. If you were three steps over to the right, you would be dead. You know? It is that huge plasma explosion coming upwards through this… the hole that is inside of this big structure. It does destroy the AM… the smaller truck to the South. The Bouquet is able to, like, dodge away. And you've no idea what fucking did that. It also goes up through the illusion above you, the illusion of the Millennium Break ship, and causes it to… Actually it doesn't cause it to vanish. It just goes through the illusion but the illusion is still there. You know? [chuckles]
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: But…
Ali: The people in the city are going to be like: [mock-shouting] “Yeaaahhh!!!” [overlapping] “Down with Millennium Break!”
Austin: [overlapping] No, because…
Janine: [laughs]
Austin: I mean, I think we get a shot of the Fabreal Duchy person in the… the pilot in this Bouquet being, like:
Austin (as Bouquet Pilot): What's happening?!? What's happening?!?
Austin: You know, calling over in the… in the communicator. And so they don't know what this is, either!
Dre: [overlapping] Hmm.
Austin: [overlapping] So there's that! Brnine, I do think that the… I think that you have to take “revealed”. I think that this plasma blast somehow knocked you out of Cloak Mode.
Ali: Um. Yeah. The way that I was going to describe that when I thought that I was going to do a good job.
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: Was that… [laughs] the… the Blue Channel sniper was going to be, like, on where Thisbe is, for, [overlapping] like, backup.
Austin: [overlapping] Uh-huh! Uh-huh.
Ali: And then, like, shoot the — in case Thisbe missed or whatever.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Ali: And I think that, like, the beam shot comes out of the Blue Channel so, you know, people know where it is. [overlapping] And it just gets…
Austin: [overlapping] People do know where it is. Yeah.
Ali: [overlapping] It just gets… fizzles with the beam that comes out of this thing.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Ali: [overlapping] Like it just does not get where it's going.
Austin: Yeah. Incredible. Yeah. You don't know what’s destroyed this whole building, basically. You know? Something from below has. Um. At this point, at least. And I think… this Bouquet is actually, like, trying to jump away and make distance. And is very much, like, “oh my god, I'm surrounded!” You know? [chuckles] Like, look around at all these… all these people. Um. And he's sending out communications to Fabreal Duchy HQ being like: “They blew something up! They blew something up!” Thinking that it was you.
[pause]
B-plot perspective [00:35:41]
Austin: Let's hop back over to Eclectic.
Keith: Hi.
Austin: So, I think the thing that is said to you is:
Riah Connadine: White Eagle?
[pause]
Keith: [labored sigh]
[pause]
Keith: Hmmm. That… That's definitely a code. [pause] And I'm, as far as I know, not White Eagle.
Austin: [chuckles] Yeah. Oh, yeah. No one's ever called you that before.
Sylvi: [half-chuckling] “You can't talk like that, White Eagle.”
Austin: [chuckles] Aw.
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Keith: Um… God! I would love to… I would love to…
[pause]
Keith: I would love to know how to respond to this!
Austin: Mm-hm. You're trained in the arts of disguise and subterfuge!
Keith: [overlapping] I am! Um… Okay…
Austin: [overlapping] “Take Advantage when attempting to hide in plain sight or subtly sabotage enemy infrastructure.”
Keith: So… I have… Um… We've established my sort of sheets of evidence, and the letters that we found that Leap originally connected to the Motion factories.
Austin: Yeah. Yup.
Keith: Is there maybe some sort of code that I could have gleaned from there that gives me a chance at guessing what the response is to this call?
Austin: That is… [chuckles] another… Dispel Uncertainties.
Keith: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] I'll let you take Advantage on this. This is disguise and subterfuge in a sense. Right? You're hiding?
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Kind of hid… Literally hiding in plain sight, this guy knows you're here. You know?
Keith: [overlapping] Yep. Takin’ advantage… Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] So 3d6 plus Know. Which in your Know is minus 1.
Keith: Minus 1.
Austin: But hey, Advantage! So 3d6 minus 1.
Keith: But hey, Advantage! Yeah.
Austin: Also, people who are failing should be making sure they're taking Spotlight. For instance, Thisbe. And… [chuckles]
Ali: [overlapping] Oh, smart!
Keith: [overlapping] Ooohh!
Austin: For instance Thisbe, Brnine and Eclectic who just failed here.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah, I just failed.
Austin: [overlapping] 1 plus 2 plus 2 plus– or minus 1 — that is a 3. You take the highest. Um. Yeah. You've no fucking idea here. And I think you… You don't even say anything. Just the amount of time it takes you to respond… He gets up and opens the door and is beginning to leave.
Keith: Shit. Okay. Umm. I am going to “reveal my true identity and my opposition is briefly stunned and my next Move is made with Confidence.”
Austin: Okay, what are you doing?
Keith: Uh. I am… going to… steal the briefcase.
Austin: Like — but as he goes to pick it up you're [chuckles] reaching under and grabbing it really quick? Or are you busting out of the door and taking it from him?
Keith: Busting out of the door!
Austin: [overlapping] Sure.
Keith: [overlapping] This is part of the “revealing my identity to stun”, this is the stun part.
Austin: [overlapping] Right.
Keith: And uh I'm going to grab the briefcase and try to [overlapping] make a run for it.
Austin: [overlapping] Alright, give me a Defy Danger!
Keith: [overlapping] Right.
Austin: [overlapping] Defy with Confidence. So 2d6 plus…
Keith: [overlapping] Defy with Confidence.
Austin: … plus 2. And then 1s are 6s.
Keith: Is there anything else I can do for myself here to set myself up a little bit better?
Austin: I don't think so.
Keith: I don't think so. Stunned and Confidence is pretty good.
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: [overlapping] 11!
Austin: [overlapping] 11!
Austin: Bust out. Slam into Connadine, who drops the… who goes to drop the attaché case but you pick it up. And now you are, what? Running away with it?
Keith: Yes, exactly.
Austin: Sprinting away. Connadine’s giving chase, right? You both burst out of the bathroom. The guy behind the counter is, like:
Austin (as Cashier): Hey! Slow down! No running inside!
Austin: Like you’re children.
Keith (as Eclectic Opposition): [hastily] It was gross in there!
Austin: Uh…
Sylvi: [bursts out laughing]
Austin: And you are being chased down the streets of Baseline C. What is your plan? [chuckles] How are you going to get away with this?
[pause]
Keith: Um… Hey, I just learned a really good escape path.
Austin: The one that he knows already? [chuckles]
Keith: Uh, I don't know for sure that he knows. And I think I can… I think I can improvise halfway through. But…
Austin: [overlapping] And, like, switch it up?
Keith: I think… Yeah. ‘Cause it's… ‘Cause if I'm following the exact pattern then I know that I'm going to be twisting and turning in a way [overlapping] that is meant to lose tails.
Austin: [overlapping] Mm-hm. Yeah.
Keith: Um… And then I'm going to… Yeah. I'm going to, like, find a really good, like, surprising left to take. [overlapping] And, like, take that left.
Austin: [overlapping] Gotcha. Alright. Give me another Defy Danger! Or another… Weather the Storm!
Keith: [overlapping] Alright.
Austin: It's… The stat is Defy. So I'm always going to say Defy Danger. [overlapping] Also, we spent years saying Defy Danger, is the problem.
Keith: [overlapping] Right. Yeah. Saying Defy Danger. Yeah. For sure.
Austin: I think at this point you are not… disguise or subterfuge. I don't think you're hiding in plain sight. At this point you're in a chase. So. This is just 2d6 plus 2. Yep.
Keith: Yes. This is a regular 2d6. Yeah. Okay. God! I really need to redo these macros. It’s something that didn't occur to me until…
Austin: Mm-hm.
[pause]
Austin: [sighs]
Keith: Oh my god!
Austin: Snake eyes!
Ali: [gasps]
Keith: Would have loved the Confidence on that one!
Austin: Uh-huh! 
Ali: [commiseratingly] Ohhh…
Austin: Unfortunately, you don't have it. And I think it's on one of these rooftops that you get tackled to the ground from behind. Um. And Connadine slams your head onto the concrete. Take the Peril “cracked”.
[pause]
Keith: [overlapping] Okay. Um…
Austin: [overlapping] As your teapot face gets a hairline fracture. You know? Not hairline: it's visible. It’s…
Keith: When I'm put in Peril [overlapping] I can read the room with Confidence and Advantage.
Austin: [overlapping] Sure! Love that! Uh…
Keith: Um… So I'm gonna roll…
Austin: Yeah, go ahead!
Keith: [overlapping] Uh, what…
Austin: [overlapping] I think the attaché case slides out of your hand — he doesn't get it, but it, like, slides across the rooftop. Dramatically. You know.
Keith: [overlapping] Sure. Yeah. What is my… What is my stat here?
Austin: To do what? What are you trying to do?
Keith: I'm Reading the Room. [overlapping] With Advantage. And Confidence. Sense is… 
Austin: [overlapping] Uh. That is Sense. Right? You Read the Room. Reading the Room is… 
Keith: Is it always Sense? I wasn’t sure.
Austin: I believe it is always Sense. Yes.
Keith: Okay. [overlapping] Plus 1 is my Sense.
Austin: Uh-huh.
[pause]
Austin: Oh sorry, [overlapping] with 3d6! What are these…
Keith: [overlapping] Jesus Christ! That's a…
Austin: [overlapping] Oh. 
Keith: [overlapping] Sorry no, no. That's… That's good. That's fine.
Austin: [overlapping] It's still only a 9! 2, 2, 1.
Keith: [overlapping] It is still only a 9. 2, 2… 1.
Austin: [overlapping] Take the 6 from the 1.
Keith: [overlapping] Take the 6 to… 1. Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] And then, yeah. 8, and then 1 more is 9. So, mixed success.
Keith: Uhh…
Austin: Um.
Keith: It's a mixed success. I will use maybe my other Hold here, I'm pretty sure.
Austin: So what are you asking?
Keith: Um… So this is a Read The Room.
Austin: And this, of course, will give you Advantage on any answers that you have.
Keith: Yeah. I'm going to ask again “what is being overlooked or obscured here?”
Austin: You think he could have killed you. You think he could have caught you… a minute ago into the chase.
Keith: Okay.
Austin: He's not giving this his all.
Keith: Okay. And, to get maybe even a little deeper into that, could I ask how Connadine really feels?
Austin: You're a pawn. You don't know in what. He needs you to take that attaché case — and there might be something real in it.
Keith: Right.
Austin: And there — I mean, there is something real in it. Uh. In fact, I'm just going to tell — he is scrambling away at this point. He is… Uh. [chuckles] He is scrambling to go get the attaché case but in a way that you know someone who moves the way he is moving, for his age, could be moving quicker and could be moving… He's giving you an opportunity to take it back from him.
Keith: Okay.
Austin: How he re…
Keith: [overlapping] Umm…
Austin: [overlapping] But it is how he really feels. I can't give you things that you don't know. Right?
Keith: [overlapping] Right.
Austin: [overlapping] So you don't know what his motivation…
Keith: [overlapping] But I do know that he should be doing better than he is.
Austin: [overlapping] Yes. I mean, what I'll tell you outright is, if you get that attaché case, you will have the information necessary to fell the Paint Shop. Period.
Keith: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] Why does Connadine wanna give that to you? Or want you to have that? I don't know. I mean, I do know. But that is… A true thing about what's happening here. Right?
Keith: [overlapping] Right.
Austin: [overlapping] You know, maybe a piece of… a piece of paper doesn't fall out of it! Maybe it opens up and, you know, you can see, or the camera can see inside that, like… this is a list of Paint Shop safehouses across the planet. This is a list of safehouse assets, of Kesh assets across the planet. Of… You know, there's itinerary of agents and stuff in here. As a reminder, the Paint Shop currently is fully Gripped. And also, as a reminder, you guys have, y'all have a Risky opportunity to fell a Pillar with zero Grip. And I'm saying that's in addition to the Gravtrain, which is what the whole mission is about. Right? So this is your Risky opportunity to fell a… secure a…
Keith: [overlapping] [intrigued] Ooohhh…!
Austin: [overlapping] Or to fell a Pillar with 0 Grip.
Keith: Okay. So… You know. New character [overlapping] growing pains stuff.
Austin: [overlapping] Yup.
Keith: Um… There's something that I have not been taking into account.
Austin: Hmm!
Keith: Two things. One is…
[00:45:00]
Austin: [chuckles]
Keith: … works against me and one works towards me. I have Enchanted Lens [overlapping] “+1 Hold on successful Read The Room rolls.”
Austin: [overlapping] You do.
Keith: Which I haven't been using. And then I have Lucky Charm. Which is a Ward.
Austin: Yup.
Keith: Which would make this Peril [overlapping] actually a Risk.
Austin: [overlapping] Just a Risk. Yeah.
Keith: But then also would have made that Read The Room not being me put in Peril. 
Austin: Right. Which means you wouldn't have gotten Confidence on it.
Keith: But it didn't… I guess it didn't help.
Austin: Did it not?
Keith: [overlapping] No, I… That… I failed that outright.
Austin: [overlapping] Are these not the ones. Sure. Su-su-sure.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah.
[pause]
Keith: [overlapping] Am I right about that? Did I fail that one outright?
Austin: [overlapping] I don’t… I don’t… [sighs]
Keith: Yeah. That was the 1 plus 1 plus…
Austin: [overlapping] No. That would change it, right?
Keith: [overlapping] No, that was the… No. That was the partial. That's the 2, 2, 1, plus 1. So that was a…
Austin: [overlapping] No, but if you would… Oh yeah! I see. [uncertainly] Ehhhh…!
Keith: Right. So that was a mixed instead of…
Austin: No. Because if that was… If the 1 plus 2 plus 2… That was… That's a Dispel Uncertainties. Because it's minus 1.
Keith: [overlapping] Right. Right? Yeah. The… The one…
Austin: [overlapping] I think that the 1 plus 1 plus 2, or the 2 plus… the one you just rolled was with Confidence.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Because of the Peril.
[pause]
Keith: Right. Right. But I'm saying… I'm saying that because it was Confidence and Advantage… [overlapping] I only succeeded because of the Confidence, which I wouldn't have had it wasn’t for the Peril.
Austin: [overlapping] Right. That’s… Yes. If it wasn’t a Peril.
Keith: Yes. [overlapping] So I guess I should just keep the Peril, yes?
Austin: [overlapping] Let’s keep it and remember that you can use Ward next time.
Keith: Yeah. Ummm… So…
Austin: But you did a plus one Hold on Read The Room, which is what you just succeeded at. Right? [overlapping] So…
Keith: [overlapping] Right. Yes. Yeah. Umm… So…
Austin: [overlapping] So if you wanted to, you could have burned that for your second question instead of burning your bonus Hold. If you want.
Keith: [overlapping] Right.
Austin: [overlapping] Up to you.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. Sure. Let's do that. Yeah. Let's do that.
Austin: Also, [overlapping] as a reminder…
Keith: [overlapping] Or I just ask a question…
Austin: [overlapping] As a reminder, you also do have B-Plot points that you can spend — from both the regular B-plot Move and also from the bonus Private Eye ones. So.
Keith: [overlapping] Right. Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Keep those in mind for helping people on the other side.
Keith: Um…
[pause]
Keith: Let's see. [whispering] Am I really…
[long pause]
Keith: Oh, so I can be advancing my Investigation Clock [overlapping] by complicating things for myself… as a whole?
Austin: [overlapping] You can!
Keith: Okay, great. I'm complicated enough right now.
Ali: [laughs]
Austin: Sure!
Dre: [laughs]
Keith: Um. Yeah. So I will keep my… I don't think I… I don't think I need to ask another question from Read The Room right now. Like…
Austin: Yes, keep your Hold.
Keith: Um… No. I'm going to burn it. I'm going to… I'm gonna ask… Oh, this is “how is X at Risk or Peril?” That is a literal…
Austin: [overlapping] Sure it is. Yes.
Keith: [overlapping] That is a mechanical Risk and Peril? Or is this… Yeah. Not… This is not a…
Austin: Hypothetical… Yeah.
Keith: Yeah. Yeah. Uh, okay. Then, yeah. I'll keep it, and I'm good and… I don't know, what now?
Austin: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Keith: [overlapping] I'm on the ground. I'm being given a chance to take this thing. I —  can I seize that chance? I would like to take the thing.
Austin: Yeah! Especially now that you know this. Right? I think that the…
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: My question is do you… How much do you let on that you know that you're being given the chance? Do you pretend like you have to hustle for it?
Dre: [chuckles]
Keith: Um… [overlapping] I would…
Austin: [overlapping] Do you want him to know that you know?
Keith: Okay. So the thing that… The thing that that puts in my head — which is, I think is really funny is —, like, me scrambling for it…
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: … and he's, like, pretending to scramble for it. But then I, like, slow down and then see him, [overlapping] like, also kind of slow down?
Austin: [overlapping] Uh-huh.
Keith: That's, I think that's really fun.
Austin: It is funny.
Keith: And fun.
Austin: And you know? And he will… He will make a break for it and run. Like, he is confident that you will continue giving chase on him for this…
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: At this point that he will not, like, slow to a completely comedic crawl but what he will do is slow at a corner and turn more slowly. Or, like, get to a cross… a cross-street and look left and look right, even though he knows he's going to turn left. Right?
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] He's going to start weaving in little ways to keep you on his tail.
Keith: Um… Can I…
[pause]
Keith: Can I… Exchange Blows Talk by… 
Austin: Sure.
Keith: …Taking out my “Reliable Sidearm, range, defensive”?
Austin: I mean, you can just do it without a gun.
Keith: [overlapping] Okay. He won’t just run away?
Austin: [overlapping] But if what you're saying is if you want the…
Keith: [overlapping] ‘Cause he could just run away.
Austin: [overlapping] The visual here to be like: “Stop! I want to talk to you.” Yeah.
Keith: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Austin: Sure. You can try it.
Keith: [sighs] Okay! That's a…
Austin: So that's going to be 2d6 plus Talk. So plus 1.
Keith: Plus 1. There we go.
Austin: [overlapping] It is!
Keith: [overlapping] That's a 9.
Austin: So you both will get a Risk here. Um. And remember, you have a Peril already, and you cannot Ward a talking Risk like this. You know?
Keith: Right. Yeah. Yeah.
Austin: What do you say? What are you trying to get from him?
Keith: Um. I… I want to know… I'm going to just say outright:
Eclectic Opposition: Why are you giving this to me? I can tell… What are you doing?
Riah Connadine: I'm done with the Paint Shop. It's over. If you're smart, you'll get off Palisade.
Eclectic Opposition: Why?
Riah Connadine: It's about to explode!
Ali: [holds back a chuckle]
Eclectic Opposition: Literally?
Austin: Shakes his head.
Ali: [chuckles]
Dre: An important question!
Austin: Yeah. He shakes his head. Not literal… I mean, [overlapping] it did just explode over near y'all.
Sylvi: [overlapping] You know?!?
Austin: Right? So.
Dre: [overlapping] Mm-hm.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. Yeah.
Austin: Shakes his head: no.
Keith: I just say… ‘cause I don't know… [overlapping] I don't know a lot.
Austin: [overlapping] Right!
Keith: So I think that I just say:
Eclectic Opposition: Motion?
Austin: I think he tilts his head. And I think this is the Risk you've given him, is “curious”.
Keith: [overlapping] Hm.
Austin: [overlapping] Um. Uh…
Riah Connadine: What do you know about Motion?
Keith: I sort of… motion…
Dre: [chuckles] Hehe…
Keith: I sort of, like, point my head and the gun at [overlapping] the smokestack.
Austin: [overlapping] Uh-huh. He nods. And looks over at it. And shakes his head.
Riah Connadine: Not my way of doing things.
Austin: I think you should take a Risk from what we've just talked about. I think he's taking the Risk “curious”.
Keith: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] Much easier for him to not be curious about someone who is interrogating him and what that person knows. You know?
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] Much easier for him to do his little mission or whatever and extract.
Keith: Sure. Um… I should…
Austin: You have to be careful. Because you have more Dangers than he does. And he is a main character. Just to be clear.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] You know?
Keith: Yeah. Um…
Austin: [sighs] I think…
Keith: I'm just thinking of [overlapping] what my Risk should be.
Austin: [overlapping] I think maybe your Risk here is, like, he is calming you down a little bit. Right?
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah…
Austin: [overlapping] He's, like, talking… You are talking to someone who is an expert at controlling the pace of a conversation; at getting you to go down the rabbit holes he wants you to. Whether I can evoke that, I don't know, but I'm doing Jack's character a disservice if I can't. You know? Like, he is a super spy. You know? In the George Smiley — you know — the Tinker Tailor model of superspy, not the James Bond model. But still, like, he will… He is good at trying to talk people into things. You know? I think maybe that's the direction here, is he starts to say:
Riah Connadine: If you're investigating Motion, then what I have in here will help you.
Keith: Um… I… I'm wor… I think maybe this is too weak but something like [overlapping] “affected”? Like… I’m… Yeah…
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah, I think that's fine. Yeah. It's broad but we know what it is. Right?
Keith: Yeah, yeah.
Austin: And he puts the attaché on the ground. And, like, takes a step back.
Keith: This might be all I need!
Austin: But he's “curious” now. And so he asks again:
Riah Connadine: [overlapping] What do you know about Motion?
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. Um… I might… I think that I rattle off, like, of, like, a conspiracy corkboard.
Austin: [chuckles] Right.
Keith: This is all… Like, all I know is, like, keywords: like, [overlapping] Baseline; City City; smokestacks.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah.
Keith: You know? The black smoke. Um… What's his name — the… Columnar…
Austin: March. Exenchester March. Yeah.
Keith: Yeah. Exenchester March.
Austin: He reaches into… He, like, hands up. You know, like ‘hey! look, I'm going to reach in to my suit jacket [overlapping] and I'm gonna take out a disc.’
Keith: [overlapping] Okay.
Austin: And he takes out a disc. And he places it on top of the… He actually takes out two discs and he looks at both of them. And he puts one of them away. And he… the one that he decides to put down he puts down on top of the attaché case. And then, you know, hands still up, you know, takes a step back and says:
Riah Connadine: Not my cup of tea. I think we'd all be better off without Motion coming back. Especially for March.
Keith: [overlapping] Okay…
Austin: [overlapping] And steps backwards to, like, the edge of the, you know, the rooftop preparing to do, like, a spy disappearing act. You know?
Keith: Yeah.
Riah Connadine: What's your name?
Eclectic Opposition: Not important.
Riah Connadine: Not important.
Eclectic Opposition: It's a family name.
[Dre & Sylvi chuckle]
Austin: A little smile.
Riah Connadine: Well, they're better for having you.
Austin: He says. And then takes that step behind off the edge and disappears. Happy to have encountered what he now thinks is some sort of rival intelligence agent. Which is not entirely wrong!
Dre: Yeah!
Keith: No. No. [overlapping] It’s not.
Austin: [overlapping] Um. Advance your… Motion Detection Clock! Your Weird Factories Clock!
Keith: Nice. [overlapping] Yeah. At four.
Austin: [overlapping] As you've been once you get back to the Blue Channel and can safely, you know, decrypt the disc he gave you.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] It is some extra intel that he has been gathering on whatever the fuck March is up to. And we can tackle that.
Keith: Is this stuff… Is this stuff safe? Should I go to a safe house, [overlapping] transfer it there, copy all the notes by hand and burn it?
Austin: [overlapping] I… Yeah. Basic… yes. Like… And I'm saying you're going to do that. Right? I'm not gonna…
Keith: [overlapping] Right.
Austin: [overlapping] I'm not going to get you on that. You know? I mean, he isn't going to get you on that either, necessarily. [chuckles]
Keith: Right.
Austin: He's not trying to pull one over on you in this particular way — there are other ways he might be trying to pull one over on you. Very clearly. [overlapping] But…
Keith: [overlapping] It’s good to play it safe.
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: Play it safe. Yep. Mm-hm.
Keith: Hey, and it’s not above something — hey, I'm not trying to pull something over on this person now, but I might want to later. So I might as well set myself up.
Austin: Right. Exactly. Are you… looking in the attaché case?
Keith: Yes. For sure.
Austin: Alright. It is what I started to say before: it is a breakdown of every active Paint Shop agent, safe house location — or at least that's what it seems to be. Right?
Keith: Mm-hm.
Austin: There are, again, there are itineraries for people leaving the planet. There are… You know. There are… check-in points. There are… You know, drop… You know? Like, what are they called? Why am I blanking on this? Like, dead-drop points [overlapping] for where you pick up more intel or drop off intel.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: There are the names of handlers. And a lot of these people have already gone because of the Bilateral Intelligence Service losing power. But this is the sort of nail in the coffin material. This is the stuff that you would need to give to one of the other Factions and have them just close it off. Right? Jade Kill or Grey Pond, like, anybody could do it. I think it's probably Jade Kill. Right? With this intel, lock it up… today. All you gotta do is send it back.
Keith: Done.
Austin: I mean, you have to like… you know, bring it somewhere where you… it's paperwork. You know? [overlapping] And probably some [inaudible]… But done.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah. Done, theoretically.
Austin: And the Paint Shop will have fallen. [overlapping] Sick.
Keith: [overlapping] Yeah.
Dre: Hm!
Austin: Mm-hm! Alright. Uh, and then, you know: shot of you, crack in your face, out of focus behind you the big egg factory. You know?
Keith: [overlapping] [quietly] Big Egg.
Austin: [overlapping] Continuing to bring in the smoke.
Keith: One of these days that Las Vegas orb is gonna start…
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: [chuckles]
Keith: … inhaling smoke. [overlapping] We're going to know exactly what's going on.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. We're ready to go, on that one.
Dre: [overlapping] Mm-hm…
Austin: [overlapping] For sure.
Keith: [overlapping] We’re ready.
Blue Channel perspective [00:57:23]
Austin: Alright. Back over to war-side. Combat team.
Dre: [chuckles]
Austin: Let's get a little bit further in here.
Dre: [laughing] War side!
Keith: [overlapping] Combat team, go!
Austin: [overlapping] It’s the same. I've just moved this over to the same map. Here we go. So yeah. The thing that happened, again, is, you know, if you look at the bottom right here… of the whole damn map is just like…
Ali: Mm-hm…
Austin: You know, huge bolts of plasma energy. [imitates sound of explosion] Phoww! You know? Blew this up. Right? And y'all are around it, you know, here-ish. You know, in various places. So yeah. There is just a… gap, you know, looking down… you can look down into this hole, this pit that has the — previously had a bunch of catwalks and rail lines and stuff — and it still has some. Because the only things that were destroyed were from the place this blast was upward. And so it's about… It's actually probably more, like, here. Oh boy, why did I grab the road?!? [chuckles]
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: … on the map also? Roll20 is my nemesis. There we go. Um. And so, yeah. You're able to look down into this hole — again, this other Bouquet guy is just fucking fleeing. Right? He's not here to… He's not going to die to you today. [chuckles] You know? [chuckles] So, unless you're chasing him down. In which case, feel free to tell me that. You know?
[pause]
Dre: No.
Austin: Okay. [overlapping] Everyone's going let this guy…
Ali: [overlapping] Cori, gun down. [laughs]
Sylvi: Wow!
Austin: I mean… You know…!
Dre: Hey, Thisbe’s the one that's “amped”.
Austin: [overlapping] I mean, truly, Cori…
Sylvi: [overlapping] Yeah. I mean, listen!
Dre: [overlapping] You know?
Sylvi: I'll do it!
Austin: “You are a sword, strike down our adversaries with impunity”!
[pause]
Dre: Oh, is this a fun time to reveal my new Hook that I wrote?
Austin: [chuckles] Yeah. Sounds, like, it could be! What is it?
Ali: Oh…!
Dre: Yeah! “Using this new lease on life purely for violence would be a waste.”
Austin: Yes!
Ali: Wow! [overlapping] We have opposite Hooks!
Austin: [overlapping] It’s a good one. Wait, what's your new Hook?
Ali: My Hook was: “I'm living a borrowed time. Keep up their fight.”
Austin: Oh! “Keep up the fight”! Right. Yeah. “Keep up their fight”! Aw…
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: Damn. True.
Dre: Damn!
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: There’s multiple ‘they’s.
Austin: Oh yeah? Is there… Is there multiple people there, for “their”? Yeah?
Ali: Yeah!
Austin: Huh.
Ali: [quietly] Come on!
Dre: Hm. Hm.
Austin: Weird.
Ali: [laughs] Phrygian! Come on!
Austin: Oh, yeah! Uh-huh! Oh, yeah.
Keith: Hell yeah.
Sylvi: I'm going to listen to the captain.
Austin: So yeah. You look down and — again, much of the catwalks and the train rails and stuff have been completely blown apart — and you can see a crew of people on a train that's a little bit lower than these… Let's add a new little level here. Again, this is in this bottom right area. It's, like, here. Right? And there's a train line away.
[01:00:00]
Austin: And… [sighs] what you can see is a group of… From this distance you can't see who they are — you can't see, like, what faction they're part of — but they are taking the train-brain out of the hallway! Or out of the, like, the little side alcove, whatever room it was in, and are beginning to lower it to a train! They're going to fucking steal this thing! Out from under you!
Dre: Oh, that sucks!
Austin: [overlapping] Uh-huh!
Dre: [overlapping] That's what we're here to do.
Austin: Yeah! That's what you're here to do! Exactly!
Ali: These are other people?
Austin: Seem to be other people! And they're lowering it into the train as we speak. and the train is, like, getting ready to go. They're Fast and Furiousing this thing. You know?
Dre: Okay. Yeah. Umm… Where'd you said they are, like, located from us?
Austin: Down.
Dre: [overlapping] And how far?
Austin: [overlapping] They're down in this pit. Right?
Dre: [overlapping] Cool.
Austin: [overlapping] So, like, in the middle where it says train depot and access point, that goes down for, like, a hundred floors.
Dre: Sick. I jump in.
Austin: Okay! You jump… You jump in! And you land next to this train that's beginning to roll away as the train-brain is lowering into it. You want that train-brain. Right?
Dre: Uh, yeah!
Austin: Alright.
Dre: I do.
Austin: Um. It is… You know. This much closer you can see that this is actually an elite Stel Nideo team.
Dre: Sick. Great. Good.
Austin: Who seem to be robbing their own people of the train-brain — without having told them. And the huge, you know, blast of plasma energy, you don't see where that came from. What do you do now that you're down here?
Dre: Hmmm…
[pause]
Dre: Can I get… My thought is to try to catch up with whatever the… I guess the engine car of this train would be?
Austin: Yep.
Dre: And to derail it.
Austin: Sure. You can try it.
Dre: Yeah. I just want to shoulder check it off the rails.
Austin: Yeah. Well… It's worth saying you're also standing on the rails. Right? Like, these are…
Dre: Sure.
Austin: This is not a floor — this is, like, free floating maglev rails. Right?
Dre: Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
Austin: So you're… a big old mech on this thing. And it's built to carry big old things. Right? But I would… you know, maybe be a little careful! [overlapping] Just be careful.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah. Sure. So I guess, like, I'm, like, trying to jump onto the top of the back car and then make my way from there?
Austin: Yeah. That's fun. Yep. Totally.
Dre: Okay. Okay.
Austin: Give me… Are you just… You're just rolling into it, huh?
Dre: Yeah! I… They're trying to leave!
Austin: Okay! Give me a Def… Weather The Storm! And I… [sighs] I think you might have to just take Disadvantage here because you're not… you've not investigated what things are. You know?
Dre: Sure. Um, how does that work when I am rolling with Advantage as well?
Austin: Oh! It just cancels out.
Dre: Okay. [overlapping] Yeah. Okay.
Austin: [overlapping] So this is just going to be… And this is… This might be how you end up losing it. Right?
Dre: Sure.
Austin: So. Yeah. 2d6 plus… what? Plus Defy.
Ali: What are you… doing? Sorry.
Dre: I’m trying to stop this train!
Ali: Okay. Can I… give you Advantage? Do you need an Advantage?
Dre: I wouldn't say no!
Ali: [laughs] Okay!
Dre: Austin took away [overlapping] my other one. So.
Austin: [overlapping] I did. I did.
Dre: [overlapping] It was rude.
Ali: Can I be, like, feeding in… like, scanning information [overlapping] to your…
Austin: [overlapping] Sure.
Ali: … your mech’s, like… [overlapping] thing?
Dre: [overlapping] Oh yeah! Give me that telemetry data!
Austin: [chuckles quietly]
Ali: Yeah. So you can, like, target it better, and…
Austin: Mm-hm!
Ali: Yeah.
Austin: Sure.
Ali: Cool.
Austin: Go ahead and… and roll with Advantage, then! Is it… Wait! Is it Advantage or is it with Confidence? [overlapping] What does it let you give?
Ali: [overlapping] Um. No. This is from Tactical Genius.
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, this is Tactical Genius. Yep.
Ali: [overlapping] Spending a Hold to give an ally Advantage on their next Move.
Austin: Got it. Alright. So, yeah. Take 3d6 plus your Defy.
Dre: Which is zero.
Austin: Oh, damn! Is it?
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: Alright.
Dre: There's a part of me that is interested in trying to pitch a Channel for this but… [overlapping] I’m not worried about it.
Austin: [overlapping] What would that look like?
Dre: [overlapping] I don't know! I can’t…
Austin: [overlapping] I’m not opposed! I just… You know.
Dre: Yeah. And I can't think of anything either. So.
Austin: Mm-hm.
Dre: Besides just… “uh, my mech-magic! I don't know!”
Austin: Mm-hm.
Dre: But yeah. I can't make a good pitch for it. So we'll just do 3d6 straight up!
[pause]
Austin: [quietly] Oh my God!
Dre: [giggles]
Ali: Wait…
Austin: So that's 6! That's 4 plus 2. Is 6.
Dre: Hey, Austin! Guess what!
Austin: What. Gur’s back!
Dre: [laughs] Yeah!
Ali: [gasps]
Austin (as Gur Sevraq): You can't simply leap into holes!
Austin: [chuckles] And as he says this…
Ali: [chuckles]
Austin: … a huge blast of plasma energy… you know, [overlapping] catches you again.
Dre: [overlapping] Ooof… Yeah…
Austin: Um. And this time… This time it's not as big as that previous blast was… And you don't see where it's coming from! But you do take… Janine what did you take before? “Scorched”?
Janine: Yeah. I got “scorched”.
Dre: Oh! Oh. Um…
Austin: Uh-huh?
Dre: I still like all of this happening, but I do want to try to… Heat Up. To redo this roll.
Austin: Oh, sure! Let's do it! What's that look like?
Dre: [overlapping] Um… I mean, I think it looks…
Austin: [overlapping] That's one Move that you brought over. Right? From… From…
Dre: [overlapping] Is that a…  That's just a Move-Move. Right?
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's from… It was an Impostor Move. I think it came over with you.
Dre: Oh! You're right! It's Hot-blooded!
Austin: Mm-hm.
Dre: Did I carry that one over? [overlapping] Yes, I did.
Austin: [overlapping] Oh no, sorry. Yeah. Heating Up is a thing you can just do…
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Austin: [overlapping] … whenever. But Hot-blooded, specifically, is a thing.
Dre: [overlapping] Hot-blood is the Move. Yeah. I brought that over.
Keith: Do you… Do you redo the whole roll, or do you… or does Gur come back and then you redo the roll?
Dre: I like that better. [overlapping]  I like Gur coming back.
Austin: [overlapping] Gur comes back. Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] The plasma coming…
Keith: [overlapping] So you reroll it, but you reroll it at Disadvantage.
Dre: Well…!
Austin: [chuckles]
Dre: [overlapping] That’s a…
Austin: [overlapping] The window's open!
Dre: We're talking mechanically versus thematically.
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: We can talk… We can figure it out mechanically. Thematically, I like the idea of basically having failed this roll…
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: … Gur comes back. The plasma comes out of nowhere.
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: And then, like, Figure hits the afterburners.
Austin: Right. Um…
Keith: Okay. But eventually, you have to end up either only rolling [overlapping] with Confiden… with Advantage or only rolling with Disadvantage.
Austin: [overlapping] Or with Disadvantage. Yes. Yeah.
Dre: Mechanically, Heating Up says you redo the roll. You retry the roll.
Keith: [overlapping] Okay. Alright. So.
Austin: [overlapping] So this is not then… So Gur is not back-back at this point.
Dre: [overlapping] No. No.
Austin: [overlapping] If you're redoing the roll then it stays the way it was before.
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah. Which means 3d6 with Advantage. Right?
Dre: Mm-hm.
Austin: Yeah. Alright. Let's see it!
[pause]
Austin: [overlapping] 7!
Dre: [overlapping] That’s a 7!
Austin: That's… Hey, listen!
Dre: That's better.
Austin: That's better! Um… 
Dre: Bye, Gur! [laughs]
Austin: Yeah… That’s… You know? It's…
Keith: 7’s slogan.
Austin: Exactly. Uh. So, yeah. You hit the… And again, this is you using… the just general Move Heat Up that lets you tick [overlapping] Overheating to retry a roll.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah. Mm-hm.
Austin: So, you discard those original ones, you take the second roll, even if it's worse — and you… dodge out of the way of this! Though on a 7-9 I think, actually, you still… There's still some cost. So I think the thing that happens here is you get knocked off the train and you're lower. So you're not… I'm just going to move you over to this other little thing.
Dre: Can I… pitch something to you?
Austin: Sure.
Dre: Could I expend a part on my mech to avoid being knocked off?
Austin: What is the… How do you do that? What's… What lets you do that?
Dre: It's… It's my shield. It has Ward.
Austin: [overlapping] Oh, yeah!
Dre: [overlapping] I know that's to… I know that's to not take a Danger, but…
Austin: Sure! But I kind of like that! The idea of, like, you cling on with the buckler and then, like, pull yourself up, but you lose the shield in the process?
Dre: Mm-hm.
Austin: That's kind of fun! Sure! But wait! One second! Sorry. How are you holding that buckler? Is it a…
Dre: Oh no, it's attached to the cannon.
Austin: I see! Okay, okay, okay. [overlapping] So it snaps off.
Dre: [overlapping] So I imagine it is less of… Yeah. It's either snaps off or I tank the hit and, like, it melts some of it off.
Austin: [overlapping] And you stay up. Yeah.
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah.
Austin: I… Yeah. Either of those works for me.
Dre: Let's… Let's say it snaps off. ‘Cause I think tanking the hit [overlapping] from the big plasma cannon that shred the ground…
Austin: [overlapping] From what we saw before…
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah. Is… is a little much. Yeah.
Dre: Listen, I don't want to no-sell the plasma!
Austin: [overlapping] I appreciate it!
Dre: [overlapping] You know?
Austin: So you're still on this thing — and I'm going to do something here with your character which is — you're up here, you're on the train. And the train leaves the station. [chuckles] Uh…
Dre: [laughs]
Austin: You begin to move away on the train! Hey everybody! We're going back over to this map, because we're leaving this entire little area…
Ali: [appreciatively] Hmm!
Austin: …As the train carrying the train-brain begins to head eastward through the Diadem towards…
Keith: Towards me!
Austin: No, that's south-west, Keith.
Keith: Ah.
Austin: Uh-huh. East…
Keith: Oh, right! [overlapping] I'm not in City City. I forgot.
Austin: [overlapping] You’re not. Yeah. Okay.
Keith: [overlapping] I was… looking it up.
Austin: City City is to the east. But yes. You’re in Baseline C. You're right here. Uh. Yeah. It starts to go this way! Starts going east towards the first of the red points or beyond.
Dre: [overlapping] Bye!
Austin: [overlapping] Is everybody else gonna give chase? [chuckles]
Sylvi: I mean…!
Austin: I mean, yes. Right?
Sylvi: Yeah?!? That's the mission. Right? [overlapping] Is the train.
Austin: [overlapping] That is the mission.
Keith: [overlapping] And the train-brain.
Ali: [overlapping] What about the lost crew, though?
Keith: [overlapping] AKA the train.
Austin: What about the lost crew?
Ali: The… Cause people. [overlapping] It is on your chart.
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah. They're down there somewhere.
Ali: Okay.
Austin: Wait, was on which chart?
Ali: You had, like, a chart that was like: “here's the surface level, [overlapping] here's where people are missing, and here's…”
Austin: [overlapping] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ali: Okay.
Austin: That lowest level is… Sorry. That lowest level is the lowest level of the Diadem.
Ali: Okay! Okay, okay, okay!
Austin: They're lost down here somewhere. You know?
Ali: Okay. Okay.
Austin: So, yeah. They're down there. And if the action gets down there we might run into them or if they… if we run into them we might run into them.
Unfortunately, the more important, or more… momentarily relevant thing is — as this train begins to pull away from Carmathen and head east down the Diadem, as y'all begin to reorient yourselves to give chase to it — there are other shapes breaking through the clouds. New types of Consecration-made mechs, new Nidean mechs. These are… They're kind of squat and squared-off in a way that most of the Nidean stuff isn't. You know, the Nidean mechs tend to have cloth or stained glass. We've seen a lot of that.
And here we see something that blends two elements that we've seen before in Divines, fairly recently: they have the sort of kingly medieval accoutrement of the Divine Souciance — which you saw in its grave under the water in the garden on Chimera's Lantern — and their bodies and faces have the toothy grin and the kind of, like, enamel of the Divine Felicity's weird little tooth monsters.
I'm not saying that Nideo has fully cracked into the center of Chimera's Lantern. I don't think that that is what has happened. But they're getting results! They're digging up parts of these Divines and the weird emanations — like those tooth monsters — and beginning to build new machines from them.
These are BAC Hatchets. They are Tier IV. They have… They have these, like, little axes in their hands along with a sort of a weighted chain in the other hand. They have… I mean, maybe the first one that lands opens up shoulder pads and releases these little tooth-like drones all around it: sharp fangs that fly around it — as… you know, what this game calls Familiars — ready to defend themselves. And there's three of them and they are not here to fucking play.
