Ali:         We're live, just FYI.
Keith:        [sighs]
Ali:        Uh... yeah, that's so funny.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        And it was two different microphones, right?
Dre:        Yes.
Keith:        Yeah, Dre, I think it was your like, shitty...
Ali:        [laughing continuously]
Dre:        Oh yeah, it was probably like the headset mic.
Keith:        Which is why it sounded like it was being recorded and reproduced somewhere, like it was coming through Ali's speaker —
Ali:        Oh, sure.
Keith:        Or it was like my thing having a weird problem...
Ali:        Sure.
Keith:        But yeah, that makes total sense.
Dre:        What a bizarre —
Keith:        Hey, computers are weird, they hate working.
Ali:        They really do.
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        I don't get it.
Keith:        No. They're always trying to break or do something wrong.
Ali:        I feel like the hard drives on my computer messed up, and all of the USB ports are broken, but like, to replace the motherboard would be weird.
Keith:        Oh, no.
Dre:        That seems bad.
Keith:        That sounds like all the important stuff.
Ali:        It's vital things. [snorts laughing]
Keith:        Yeah.
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        Are they like SSDs, or are they like... are they platter hard drives?
Ali:        Uh... I have two SSDs and one normal one.
Keith:        Okay.
Ali:        I have three, actually.
Keith:        That's a good layout, I think. That's exactly what I have, so I'm sealing, I'm putting my seal of approval on it.
Ali:        Oh, thank you for your approval.
Keith:        Well, otherwise I'm condemning myself.
Dre:        That's true.
Ali:        [laughing] it's all like hand-me-downs from my brother because he's like, both works at an electronics store and is extremely gamer-pilled. I like, when I thought my computer — when I thought laptop was broken, I was like, I need a new laptop, do you recommend anything? And he was like, I'm sorry to tell you, but this 1400-dollar computer is the only thing worth buying. And I was like... you're lying. That's a lie.
Keith:        I think he's close to right.
Ali:         [laughing]
Dre:        No, he probably is close to right.
Keith:        The Dell XPS laptops are cheaper, and those are good, but laptops are in a miserable state. Sorry Dre, I missed what you said because I had you turned down a little bit for some reason.
Dre:        No, I was agreeing with you that Ali's brother was probably unfortunately right.
Keith:        Yeah, it's rough.
Ali:        Yeah...
Dre:        I mean, the state of upgrading a PC nowadays is that you're just better-off buying a pre-built than trying to —
Keith:        Totally, yeah.
Ali:        Oh yeah.
Dre:        Buy a graphics card somewhere.
Keith:        I went through this with my friend because I was like, in a group, in a Discord chat that I'm in, I was like, okay, who's playing Halo Infinite with me, and... my friend was like, oh, I totally am. And then he downloaded it and installed it and booted it up and he has like... my GPU's too old.
Ali:        Aw.
Keith:        And I was like, great, it's 2021 — it was 2021 at the time — it's 2021 and there's no solution to that.
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        It was like, you can spend 600 dollars on a new GPU, or you can spend 1100 dollars on a whole new computer. Like...
Ali:        Yeah.
Keith:        It's miserable.
Dre:        It's also generous of you to assume that for 600 dollars you'll get a new GPU and not something that's like... 5 years old.
Keith:        Sorry, I meant a used GPU that's newer than his current used GPU.
Dre:        Yeah, yeah.
Keith:        This is how bad it is... I'm sure that prices have gone a little bit down —
Dre:        I doubt it.
Keith:        But at the height of the GPU shortage like a year ago, my, my hard drive that I — sorry, not my hard drive, my GPU that I replaced at the beginning of the pandemic, I built a new computer, which was, I'm so lucky that I did that in like May, June of 2020.
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Same, I did the same thing.
Keith:        Uh... uh, zero insight. You did not do this with like, I bet there's going to be a chip shortage. No, no idea. Uh... I built — that was like a 2014, I got it in like 2014, it was like a 2012 GPU, and I got it for about 300 dollars, maybe 280 or something like that. And it was selling on eBay for 900 dollars.
Dre:        Yeah. Mm-hm.
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Miserable. I should look up what my old graphics card would have sold for on eBay — 750 dollars, yep.
Keith:        Yeah. Yeah. Your old one.
Dre:         Yeah, that, my old 2070 super.
Keith:        I had I, I had a... a Radeon 360?
Dre:        A 3060?
Keith:        Maybe?
Dre:        Oh, no — a 3600? Sorry, you were saying Radeon and in my head I was doing Nvidia numbers
Keith:        I know. I don't know the numbers anymore, either.
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        Yeah, I don't remember what number that I had. It... it was doing, it was fine. Like, it was, I'm, like Ali's brother, I'm gamer-pilled. And I was getting —
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        [chuckles] I was getting, I was getting like 50 frames per second on... I think, honestly, I think the thing that I was really annoyed about was the Modern Warfare remake wasn't running well at all.
Dre:        Keith? Same. Goddamnit.
Keith:        Well, wait, mine wasn't the remake, it was the new Modern Warfare that had come out. But yes.
Dre:        Oh, okay, yeah. Mine was like Modern Warfare 1, online, like I was trying to play some deathmatch.
Keith:        Yeah, you gotta have 60 on that, at least.
Dre:        Well, I upgraded to like... 10 or something like — 110, what I was at when I was playing.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        [laughing] Cool
Dre:        This is the most boring conversation. I love it, but...
Ali:        No, you know, it's a struggle. This is why I play on my PS4, I don't have time to worry about these things.
Keith:        It was a... Sapphire branded, Radeon Nitro R9390. That was what I had.
Ali:        Thank you for your service.
Keith:        So let me see what that's selling for... oh, hey, look, prices on this have come way down. Oh, no, this one's still selling for 570. Oh, actually, the eBay — the Amazon listing has them listed new for 967 dollars. [incredulous] 967 dollars... I paid just over 300 for it.
Ali:        Yowza. That's, uh... yeah, well, yeah.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        [laughing] Welcome to Live at The Table.
Keith:        Oh, we're live?
Ali:        Yeah.
Keith:        What did people think of that?
Ali:        Uh... people are saying.
Keith:        Frank says, it's bad out there. Yeah, hell yeah it is.
Dre:        Bad, it's bad.
Ali:        Yeah, yeah. Well, today we're not playing a graphically strenuous game. We're playing Uncover Your Story by Zuhayri Mohamed.
0:07:00.6        And, yeah, like I said, welcome to Live at The Table, an actual-play livestream focused on... good times between friends? I still — [laughing]
Keith:        Ali needs flashcards.
Ali:        Austin used to have a that thing was just like, fine — and I —
Keith:        [unintelligible]
Ali:        And I did not... he, he probably wrote it down somewhere.
Keith:        Oh, you mean like, his little intro thing was fine.
Ali:        Yeah. Because it couldn't be critical world-building, smart characterization...
Keith:        No.
Ali:        It was like... [laughing]
Keith:        Welcome to doing it... doing it, having fun, at the table, doing it live and, uh, trying our best.
Ali:        Yeah, we're here, we're live, we're going to have a good time, we're looking at some games. You know, just some games.
Dre:        Yeah, I remember the different thing. I remember that. I don't remember what it was, but I remember it existed.
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        And if that's good enough for me, it should be good enough for everyone listening.
Ali:        You know, everybody knows what we're doing here. My name is Alicia Acampora, I'm joined by Keith J. Carberry.
Keith:        Hi. My name is Keith Carberry, you can find me on Twitter at @keithjcarberry. You can find me scouring eBay for this weird, old turntable I've been looking for.
Dre:        [intrigued] Oh.
Keith:        And you can find me on YouTube at YouTube.com/runbutton.
Ali:        Uh, I'm also joined by Andrew Lee Swan.
Dre:        Hey. You can find me on Twitter at @swandre3000, where I mostly just tweet the Wordle thing every day.
Ali:        Oh, sure.
Keith:        I don't know what that is.
Ali:        You don't know what Wordle is?
Dre:        It's just a little game.
Keith:        No, I saw the green blocks, like people tweeting out green blocks, and I was like... what the fuck is this that everybody but me knows about? And then I learned a few days later that it was called Wordle. But it didn't help me know what it was, so I don't know what it is.
Ali:        Wordle is in the tweet — it's just like a —
Dre:        Little word game.
Keith:        Is it like, what if a crossword was 2 minutes long?
Ali:        Basically.
Dre:        No.
Ali:        Well...
Keith:        Oh...
Dre:        Uh, it's more like the jumble, I would say.
Ali:        Oh, sure.
Dre:        I think it's more like a jumble.
Keith:        Like boggle?
Dre:        Kind... of. Basically, there is a 5-letter word, and you're trying to guess what the word is.
Ali:        Uh-huh.
Dre:        And whenever you put in a guess —
Keith:        It's pizza.
Dre:        Maybe. Maybe that's tomorrow's, who knows?
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        It'll basically say, like, hey, you've got these letters correct, and, if any, these are the correct letters you have in the right place. And so then you have six guesses to get the word.
Keith:        Okay.
Dre:        That's it. It's just a little fun thing to do.
Ali:        Yeah.
Dre:        5 minutes every day.
Ali:        I wake up every morning and I think to myself, “I've never heard of words before.”
Keith:        How —
Ali:        I don't know what letters are, I say to myself.
Keith:        And I know that the — I learned that the thing is, again, I didn't learn anything about what it was, but I learned that you only get one. It's not like, let me go play 12 levels of Wordle.
Dre:        Yeah, no.
Ali:        Oh, it's one a day, yeah.
Dre:        It's one per day, one a day.
Keith:        Yep. That sounds like such a chore to me.
Ali:        Well, it's... [laughing] it's optional, first of all.
Keith:        No, I mean, but that's why I, that's why I didn't investigate. Because it sounds like, “shit, I've got to remember to feed my fish.”
Dre:        Mmm. He
Keith:        It's like, it doesn't take a long time, but I've still got to stop, I still have to remember it.
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        When I say chore, I don't mean like, “ugh, what a chore,” I mean like —
Ali:        Sure.
Keith:        I have to remember to do it, or I won't do it.
Dre:        No, that's fair.
Ali:        Yeah.
Keith:        Sort of like, this is not a perfect analog, but it's like the Animal Crossing thing, where it's like, it's like, it really only wants you to play it for like 20 minutes.
Ali:        [laughing] Oh, sure.
Keith:        And it's just not long enough of a time... like I have — if I'm playing a video game, I need to be able to play it for 3 hours in a row.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay. Different strokes, you know?
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        People need other things in their life. Your brain is like [unintelligible]
Keith:        I don't know how to do something for less than an hour. So I've got 24 things, max, that I can do per day, and that's if I don't sleep.
Ali:        Okay.
Dre:        You should... sleep.
Keith:        Oh, I do, I do sleep, so I guess, let's say, let's just round it to... 17 things max per day.
Ali:        Okay. Well, today you're going to be playing Uncover Your Story... [laughing]
Keith:        Yeah, that's one thing.
Dre:        Yeah, hope you got one left.
Ali:        [laughing] so, this is another solo game, actually, where basically what you're doing is using a deck of cards to make a character. First, you can see on the screen here, we're going to reveal some of these cards, and then choose some attributes off of this list here. And then we are going to be playing a game of pyramid solitaire, in order to generate... outcomes, basically. [laughing] Uh... so let's just jump into it. Do y'all have any, like, questions before we start... or?
0:11:52.8        
Keith:        Uh... so I, I read the thing. It's only a page.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        You said, if you don't know how to play pyramid solitaire, that's fine.
Ali:        Yeah.
Keith:        So I listened to you, and I don't, I have not ever learned how to do that.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay.
Keith:        It seems like it's just solitaire, but you have to add things up to 13.
Ali:        Yeah, basically.
Keith:        Okay.
Dre:        Oh, okay.
Ali:        And because the, the, the cards are like, in a pyramid, you have to be careful about what's covering what, or whatever. Like if a card is covered by another card, you can't play it, obviously.
Keith:        Right, it's not like normal solitaire where you've got a bunch of rows.
Ali:        Right, yeah.
Keith:        You've got an increasing amount of rows — or, decreasing.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        Do you build the pyramid, or do you deconstruct it?
Ali:        We — uh — you start with a full pyramid, and then you deconstruct it.
Keith:        Okay.
Ali:        And you play with the cards that you draw, but you can only have one active drawn card at a time, so we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, but let's say you had like, a row that was like a 9, a 3, a 3, you would have to draw your deck to get to a 4 before you could pair the cards to make a 13, and then follow your prompt.
Dre:        Okay.
Ali:        But, yeah, so, I laid out the 10 cards already, so I think we're ready to just jump into this. I'm going to pick this first card.
Keith:        Oh, I'm on the wrong page. I can get there. There we go. I was watch — sometimes I watch the YouTube, and I'm like, “that's me.”
Ali:        Oh, shit. [laughing] no, no, you're here, in the... official one. So, I'm flipping this one in the bottom right. And that's an ace. Uh... so our occupation is knight.
Dre:        Okay, all right.
Ali:         I have this little box here to but our... attributes?
Keith:        Oh, so we each have — we share one, we don't each have one.
Ali:        Yeah, this is a solo game, so I figured we would do it collaboratively, instead of like —
Keith:        Gotcha. It didn't give — it's solitaire, so I should have assumed, but I was just like —
Ali:        [laughing] Sure.
Keith:        We're just going to solitaire, but it's 3 people.
Ali:        I mean, we are doing that, yeah. Instead of, like, I don't know how it would go if we had three different, we would play three different games, essentially, and I think that would get kind of...
Keith:        Yeah. I should have known that it was, that it was just one. Because I even read it and I was like, it doesn't say how many people the game is for.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        They always say how many people it's for. But then it's about, it's solitaire, so I got it.
Ali:        Uh-huh.
Keith:        Long week.
Ali:        Can y'all interact with these cards? I don't know if it's just like a player thing.
Keith:        Uh... yes, I can.
Ali:        Do you want to flip one of them?
Keith:        I'll flip this one... wait, any — no, not anywhere, surely not anywhere.
0:14:44.2        
Ali:        [laughing] What do you mean?
Dre:        [unintelligible] Keith, here?
Keith:        Can I flip any one of —
Ali:        Yeah. These 10 cards are here for the —
Dre:        Yeah, yeah.
Keith:        Then I'll flip that one.
Ali:        Okay. So now our location is at a forgotten temple.
Keith:        Ooo.
Ali:        Whoever's adding those squares, I appreciate it.
Dre:        It's me.
Keith:        Oh, nice.
Ali:        I'm also just going to write some down...
Keith:        Yeah, no, totally. Hey, redundancy, it's important.
Ali:        [laughing] uh... Dre, do you want to pick a card?
Keith:        Nice color pick, too.
Dre:        Sure.
Keith:        It's a really, very chill purple.
Ali:        Yeah.
Dre:        Uh... okay, here, I have to right-click.
Keith:        Yeah.
0:15:20.4        
Ali:        Ooo, a queen.
Dre:        Ooh, a malevolent deity.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:         Damn, in a temple?
Ali:        Oh, see?
Keith:        That's perfect, they love that shit.
Dre:        [laughs] They do.
Ali:        Okay. Back to me? Which card are we going to flip? Hm... another ace. Ooh, we have an entire guild of allies? That's perfect.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        A whole guild. [under breath] The adventure... oop.
Keith:        Ooh, the unique skills here are pretty good.
Dre:        Uh-huh.
Keith:        [unintelligible] can understand all languages, endlessly replenishing rope, an indestructible shield, ability to befriend anyone... that would solve this malevolent deity really quick.
Ali:        Yeah.
Keith:        [laughing] Regenerate from wounds quickly, the ability to use elemental magic, flight, and incredible amount of wealth, super-strength, ability to learn anything quickly, a sword that can cut anything.
0:16:30.3        Those are pretty good. I'll flip one. 8.
Ali:        8...
Keith:        That's... [laughing] an incredible amount of wealth.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        So, we are a... mega-wealthy knight who runs/funds an adventurer's guild.
Dre:        Yes.
Ali:        Okay, sure, yeah.
Dre:        We only have bot friends. No real friends, just paid-for friends.
Ali:        [laughing] Well, maybe they, you know, they, you know...
Keith:        But Ali, you can never know.
Ali:        Sure, but...
Dre:        Yeah, you'll never know.
Keith:        You can never know.
0:17:01.8        
Ali:        What if we're an adventurer's guild with like a good healthcare? [laughing]
Dre:        They're just using me for my healthcare.
Ali:        Wow.
Keith:        This is what keeps Drake up at night.
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        [laughing] Oh god.
Keith:        This is literally the specter that haunts every rich and famous person.        
Ali:        When you said that, I thought that you meant Nathan Drake. I don't know how my mind got there. [laughing]
Dre:        Both, it works.
Keith:         Him too.
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        Yeah, they're after him for his healthcare and his statues.
Ali:        [continuously laughing]
Keith:         Sully just wants me for this gold statue and for low co-pays.
Ali:        It must be tough to be Nathan Drake.
Dre:        Yeah. Damn.
Ali:        So, we are... the manager of a successful adventurer's guild.
Keith:        Owner/manager, famous owner/manager.
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        Famous.
Keith:        Rare, rare owner/manager.
Dre:        [unintelligible]
Ali:        Owner/manager.
Keith:        A sole proprietor, LLC.
Ali:        Okay, yeah. [laughing] uh... uh... okay.
Keith:        With merch.
Ali:        Okay. [laughing] uh... does anybody have any strong feelings about this temple?
Keith:        Strong how?
Ali:        Like, do you think, should it be, you know... uh, in a cave? Should it be a water temple? Should it be...
Dre:        Hm...
Keith:        I like temple carved out of a cave.
Dre:        Yeah, I'm digging that, that's a good vibe.
Ali:        Okay. Okay.
Keith:        Yeah, that was a good first instinct, cave temple.
Ali:        Temple carved into a cave... okay. But also forgotten.
Keith:        We'll mash 'em up, behind a waterfall, we can even, secret, it's like a... check behind the waterfall, there's a whole temple, whole extra hidden level in there.
Ali:        Ooh... [laughing] behind a waterfall. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you've got to go past the waterfall into a cave, and then there's murals and other temple markings. [laughs] Uh...
Dre:        I need to reopen this game, because I closed it, like a dumbass.
Ali:        Okay, sure.
Keith:        That's the part about highs and lows, that's the part that I couldn't remember, okay.
Ali:        Yeah, fair. Okay, yeah. Okay. Uh... any other questions we feel like we have at this point?
Keith:        We had a, we have a really weird pyramid base here.
Ali:        Oh, this isn't — these cards are going to be taken out of the deck.
0:19:50.4        
Keith:        Oh, okay. I thought this was going to form the, okay, gotcha.
Ali:        Yeah, no, no, no, actually, I'm going to do that now. Remove cards. Okay. Yeah. While y'all think of maybe more things you want to establish about this person, I'm going to set up our pyramid.
Dre:         Okay.
Ali:        And not that you have to, but I just feel like, top of the game, we can... figure out a name.
Keith:        So we have a knight haunted by his own wealth, unable to —
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        Create or maintain legitimate relationships —
Dre:        Yep.
Keith:        Because of the constant fear that those relationships are built on people's unspoken motives...
Ali:        Sure, sure.
Keith:        We know about his adventurer's guild, and that it's really nice, and they have a gift shop.
Ali:        [laughing]
0:20:45.1        
Dre:        Okay, yeah, uh-huh.
Ali:        Yeah, this is, you know —
Keith:        What's the most expensive thing in the gift store?
Ali:        Ooh...
Keith:        A glass... sculpture... that depicts — hand-blown, obviously —
Dre:        Sure.
Keith:        No other way to do it back then.
Ali:        So back then, this is not like, far future.
Keith:        No. Well, I feel like knight, knight, forgotten temple.
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, you're right.
Keith:        Malevolent deity. It suggests, uh...
Ali:        Right. Yeah.
Keith:        Past/fantasy. But — doesn't have to be. This could be a Jedi.
Ali:        [laughing] They are a knight.
Keith:        Ali, do you want this to be a Jedi?
Ali:        Huh?
Keith:        Do you want this to be a Jedi?
Ali:        I'm not saying that it has to be.
Dre:        If it's a Jedi, then the most expensive thing is the, is the replica lightsaber, so that's what I learned.
Keith:        Right.
Dre:        Going to Disneyworld.
Ali:        [laughing] we can't just do...
Keith:        I'll say this. There could be a really, really nice Jedi master replica robe.
Ali:        Okay. We —
Dre:        Those were also expensive at Disneyworld.
Ali:        True.
Keith:         My phone has started feeding me, like, you know how your phone feeds you, like, “here's 20 articles we think you like!”
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        And, I hate it all the time, even when I see one — I actually hate it more when I see one that I do want to click on.
Ali:        Yeah. 100 percent, yeah.
Dre:        [laughing]
Keith:        Because then like, you fucking got me.
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        And sometimes I click on them just because I'm so confused at why it's showing me this. Uh... and that's when I feel the most okay about it, is when I'm like, “why do you think I want this? Click.” Uh... uh, and there was one of those, where it was this entire — it was like a Disney weirdo website, for like, people who are obsessed with Disney.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
0:22:40.0        
Keith:        Which is fine, be obsessed with Disney, I don't mind. But it does make you a weirdo, sorry. And, uh, it was — an article about a woman who had a bad time buying a lightsaber at Disney.
Ali:        Oh, sure.
Dre:        Oh.
Keith:        One person. It was a whole article, it wasn't by that woman. It was by someone who worked at this website, being like, “this person had a bad time at Disney buying a lightsaber.”
Ali:        [laughing]
0:23:11.8        
Keith:        They wouldn't — they ran out of gift boxes, and so they gave her like a plastic bag to put the lightsaber in.
Dre:        How dare...
Keith:        And they didn't give her a partial refund.
Ali:        Ooh.
Keith:        And it was a whole 2-page — 2 pages about this. 2 pages.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        It was like 800 words.
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Oh, man.
Ali:        I was like a little bit on board with how you could make a story out of this. Because like, the point of a lightsaber thing is like, you're supposed to be, like, you're supposed to be imbued with one, it's like this whole weird LARP experience.
Keith:        Yes.
Dre:        Well, and I wonder, if they, if this person did that, or they just bought one at the gift store. Because you can do that, too.
Ali:        Oh, sure.
0:23:48.7        
Keith:        No, it was, they bought the experience.
Ali:        Yeah.
Dre:        Okay. Yeah.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        Well... I'm sorry that you had a bad time, lady.
Dre:        I mean, even the gift box they give you is not that great. It's just like a, a, a bag.
Keith:        A black bag, right?
Dre:        It's like a black bag, and then there's like, uh, styrofoam inside of it to protect the plastic tube part that's the blade.
Ali:        Oh.
Keith:        Yeah. I saw —
Dre:        So it's not, it's not that nice... I mean, it's fine.
Keith:        Did you enjoy the experience, Dre?
Dre:        I did, I did. I had a really good time.
Keith:        Did you like when everyone has to raise their lightsaber and like, cha-kunggg — turn it on?
Dre:        I did, I did. I felt very cool.
Ali:        Oh, did you do that?
Dre:        Yeah, no, it was fucking — [laughs]
Keith:        I haven't been, but...
Dre:        Listen, I'm, I'm pretty burnt-out and like, like, cynical about Star Wars stuff.
Keith:        Yeah, me too.
Dre:        But when I fucking built that lightsaber. Oh my god, dude.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:         What if — okay, okay, but what if you had really strong feelings that one of the worst things about the new canon was the way that they changed how lightsabers work?
Dre:        That's — what did they change?
0:24:54.2        
Keith:        Uh... they, I... anyone who has, I'm sorry if I sound like a broken record on this because you also watch Runbutton and have heard me complain about this on 3 to 5 separate occasions since Disney bought Star Wars.
Ali:        [laughing] mm-hm.
Keith:        But to make an extremely long and boring story with a lot of stupid little bits, short, basically what they did is they turned the lightsaber crystals that make lightsabers work, from lightsaber crystals, into a semi-sentient magic crystal, called a Kyber crystal —
Ali:        Ah.
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        Uh... and, uh, that like, is alive and it senses whether it likes you or it hates you, and if it hates you because you're on the dark side, it makes itself red.
Dre:        Oh...
Keith:        And I — I actually really liked — oh, and then it also has to do with this weird place, the Kyber place, and there's like a weird —
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Gotcha
Keith:        Jedi mined and poured the Kyber crystals like weird oil barons, and they don't let anybody else in the galaxy use them, because they're their special powerful magic crystals that only like Jedi. Uh... and, it used to just be that any crystal could focus a lightsaber into a beam, because crystals work as crystals. Uh... and that's what a crystal does. And Sith lightsabers were red because they didn't have access to the caves were these crystals were, and so they just made them synthetically, and because they were synthetic, they were red. The color that the synthetic crystals produce.
0:26:23.8        It was just like a very simple explanation of, how does a lightsaber work? All right, just pop a crystal in there. There's an emitter that emits a bunch of energy, pop a crystal in. And now there's like this whole weird magic-y thing, and you have to go on a Force adventure —
Dre:        Gotcha.
Keith:        The Clone Wars, the first Disney episode of the Clone Wars — I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        The first Disney episode of the Clone Wars show is the episodes that redefines the building your lightsaber experience as a thing that you do when you're an extremely young Padawan, and it involves you going on a bizarrely dangerous, like, Force journey, like, like, a, akin to the one that Luke goes on in Empire, where he sees the like, like, “I'm not afraid.” “You will be.” And he sees, like, Darth Vader, and Darth Vader kills him. Or, he kills Darth Vader, and then he opens it, and it's Luke Skywalker's face.
Dre:        It's him.
Ali:        Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Keith:        Yeah, but they make like, a bunch of kids do that in a cave, and if they don't do it right then they get trapped in this cave overnight. It's like crazy. And it's all to get these weird magic crystals that, like, are alive. It's weird, I don't like it. Anyway.
Dre:        I do like, though, that they made the Jedi even bigger assholes as part of this.
Keith:        Yeah, they, they do, and I, that's sort of, last time I talked about this on Runbutton, I said, I mentioned as much. But it's also like, they do such a bad job of taking much assholes the Jedi are seriously.
Dre:        Yeah, that's true.
Keith:        They keep on just piling on all of this stuff, and just pretending it's not there still. Like, the mountain is getting really big, and no one is still looking at it.
Dre:        Yeah. I guess, in my head, I thought they were always called Kyber crystals.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Uh, no, just for 6 years, just for 6 or 7 years, yeah. They were just called —
Dre:        They just used to be called like, lightsaber crystals?
Keith:        Yeah.
Dre:        Huh. Okay.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Ali, do you want to talk about this for another 25 more minutes?
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Anyway, I linked this weird picture I found from, from Wookiepedia of like a low-res Anakin and Obi-Wan Kenobi hanging out on like a cart, with a big, low-poly crystal, in the discord.
0:28:37.0        
Ali:        Yeah.
Keith:        They changed, changed the Death Star. The Death Star laser is a big fucking Kyber crystal now, that's how they do that. They say, oh yeah, that was Kyber crystal.
Dre:        Oh...
Keith:        I don't know. It just is unnecessary. It's like —
Dre:        Yeah, no, it's wack.
Keith:        I was a big, like, hey, everybody calm down about them erasing the EU canon, but to then just like, unnecessarily replace a bunch of established little bits of stuff with lore that is a lot worse, to me, is like — we already knew how lightsabers work. Erasing that the book, the content of the books happened is one thing, but then being like, “actually, lightsabers have little, little space rocks inside them, and they have personalities, and they —“ I don't know, I don't get it.
Dre:        Midichlorians. Why that?
Keith:         Yeah, they basically, yes, they turned Kyber crystals into midichlorian rocks, is really the —
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        I am so sorry. I am so sorry.
Keith:        That's really the short answer of it.
Ali:        The transformation [unintelligible] I agree with you.
Dre:        Anyway, Disneyworld, they just tell you that, that there's scavengers that found them. So, yeah, that's, that's what they do there.
Ali:        Uh...
Keith:        Okay.
Ali:        Sure.
Keith:        One day, maybe, I'll, if I can ever go on a vacation, I'll do it.
Ali:        [laughing] Yeah, I was lucky to live in California when that released, and then also, pre-pandemic, was... good timing.
Keith:        Yeah, the closest thing that I could do is like, go all the way to Florida.
Ali:        Oh yeah, but you can go to the LARP hotel.
Keith:        I could go to the LARP hotel.
Dre:        In a couple years, yeah, in a couple years.
Keith:        Whenever that opens.
Ali:        Uh-uh.
Keith:        Also, there, the pandemic isn't worse...
Ali:        We shall see, we shall certainly see.
Dre:        We went right as we were still in that hopeful time, where it's like, “oh, yeah, everybody's getting boosters, omicron's not a thing yet...” and, yeah. Anyway, this knight...
Ali:        [laughing]
0:30:26.0        Yeah, so we landed on robe was the expensive thing in the shop, is that what we?
Dre:        Yeah, replica robes, yeah.
Ali:        Our adventurer's guild uniform is maybe... well, because I don't want this to be a situation where we'll selling people uniforms and we're an incredibly wealthy person. Like, I want to supply our adventurer's guild with equipment.
Keith:        Oh, they've got equipment.
Dre:        Oh yeah. That's tax write-off, baby.
Keith:        We can, we can go to the first thing that I was suggesting, that it's an intricate glass-blown sculpture of a... you know, the, the, the battle that was the founding moment of the adventurer's guild, the first like, first big submission.
Ali:        Oh.
Keith:        And you can buy the sort of like, it's like the less-gauche version of having a statue of yourself, because it's actually the statue of the monster, but we're there killing it, so...
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, I would love to have one of those of a triumphant moment of my life. Uh, but that's for sale?
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        In our merch shop?
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        Sure, yeah. Yeah, there's 8 of them. They're identical. Because —
Ali:        Oh, sure, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keith:        They're plated and numbered.
Ali:        Does that mean we have fans? Are there people who are like, oh, did you hear that the guild went out and na-na-na-na-na-na-na. I'm going to buy the town, you know — you know, journal to see the... latest story about the adventurer's guild. Should this guild have a name?
0:31:59.3        
Keith:        [sighs] well, it should.
Dre:        It should.
Keith:        It should have a name.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        What that name is, I don't know. Also, I — because I, I was very deep in thought on the, “should this guild have fans?” Which you asked, skeptically, because it doesn't show up a lot that a guild would have fans.
Ali:        Right.
Keith:        And I'm thinking about it, and: why wouldn't the group of badasses that saves the town all the time, not have fans?
Ali:        Right?
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        We're out here adventuring, going on adventures... I mean, like, the basis of this game, by the way, is that you are using this deck of cards to like, tell a tale of one of your adventurers. So we could be like prepping the next... [laughing] you know what I mean? This could be the next journal from the guild, with like, oh yeah, I went out there and there was like a tragic event happened, but then some good shit happened, and yadda-yadda-yadda, and maybe that's like an in-character, in-universe reason to like, sort of want to jot these things down.
Keith:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        Do have record for our [laughing], for our fans.
Dre:        Did you get the new [unintelligible] journal?
Ali:        The... adventurers'... guild... merch shop... is very successful, because the town loves — loves, adventure.
Keith:        Loves adventurers.
Dre:        What if our guild is just “the friends of,” blank, and that's our name?
Ali:        Ooh.
Keith:        And it's our name?
Dre:        Yeah.
0:33:47.0        
Ali:        Right, but then we need a... then we need a name.
Dre:        Then we do need a name.
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Hm...
Keith:        Damn, you just...
Ali:        [unintelligible]
Dre:        What if our name is Blank? What if our name is Blank?
Keith:        We need a different kind of name — fuck!
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Yeah, one at a time, Ali. I gave one good name. I gotta think about it.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Dre:        Uh... No, that's bad. Name...
Keith:        I've just been looking on the screen to be like, maybe there's a word on here that's a name. It's not working.
Ali:        Oh, sure, yeah. I keep thinking of Polar, because I'm drinking a can of seltzer, and that's how I get my name these days.
Dre:        Listen, yeah, we could be the Friends of Polar, I'm down for that.
Keith:        Polar —
Ali:        Friends of Polar? Yeah?
Dre:        It's Po Lar.
Ali:        [laughing] Po Lar, yeah, Friends of Po Lar.
Dre:        Okay. I mean Po Lar also sounds like a good Jedi Star Wars name, so...
Keith:        It does, actually, not bad.
Ali:        Yeah... yeah... okay. Yeah. Our successful adventurer's guild, with our good investments...
0:35:04.3        
Keith:        There you go. There is where you get your names, now very literally, from the Polar can.
Ali:        One final thing is, that we haven't — okay — [laughing] that we haven't fleshed out at all is this malevolent deity.
Keith:        Okay. Yeah.
Ali:        What was the deity generator? Or do we just want to do this off of the dome, talk it through?
Keith:        Dome. Uh...
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Maybe for a name — maybe we'll generate a name.
Ali:        Okay. Okay.
Keith:        Uh... but, obviously, obviously, this is the corrupted spirit of the priest whose soul is trapped by the grief of having been forgotten, before the priest died.
Ali:        Oh... sure.
Dre:        So, was the priest good —
Keith:        Yes.
Dre:        And then got trapped and forgotten and so became malevolent afterwards.
Keith:        Right. Yeah — you know, happy to be, happy to be the priest of this temple, but people stopped coming, you get older, no one's, no one's showing up anymore. You worked your whole life in this temple, and now you're, you've got, you've got no one but yourself. And then you die, and then your haunted revenant specter roams the halls of your, the, the temple that is now your prison.
Ali:        Oh, sure. Okay, yeah. Okay, yeah. That's the — [laughing] — the deity has arrived.
Dre:        That's a malevolent creature, yeah.
Ali:        Yeah. Uh... I'm going to mute myself and type what we just went over, and if I come back and there's still noise, this is a live show, you know?
Keith:        No, yeah, this is foley work. What are you —
Dre:        What is the noise, what is it?
Ali:        It's my radiator.
Keith:        Oh, okay.
Dre:        Oh... I was hoping it was like, a cat doing something funny.
Keith:        It did sound like a cat. It sounds like a cat, like, banging a bowl.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        Or it sounds like, uh... uh, someone poking their finger inside your mail slot over and over again.
Dre:        Oh yeah, and like hitting the flap up against the door? That —
Keith:        Yeah.
Dre:        No, that makes sense.
Keith:        What is this, uh... what is this image from that you put here?
Dre:        It was from Wookiepedia.
Keith:        Oh, but... what from Wookiepedia?
Dre:        The, the Kyber crystal page.
Keith:        It's got — this has to be like an old video game, right? It's got to be like some weird [unintelligible]
Dre:        It says, “Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan with a giant Kyber crystal on...” U-top-au? Uta-pau? I don't know. I'm going to Google this, this planet.
Ali:        Hi.
Dre:        Hello.
Keith:        Hi, is it warm now?
Ali:        [laughing] it's... you know? It's weird because it's not like the sort of thing where it's like, boom, blast of hot air, or whatever.
Dre:        Yeah.
0:38:28.8        
Ali:        But it's like, comforting to know that it's happening. My apartment is chilly sometimes.
Keith:        Yeah. Eventually, this will radiate.
Ali:        Uh-uh... [laughing]
Keith:        Do you have control over that radiator?
Ali:        Well, so, uh... there's a knob that says open and close on it.
Keith:        Yeah. Right.
Ali:        And I... uh... could close it all the way to just turn it off.
Keith:        Right.
Ali:        And I feel like in my head I think that if I turn it 50 percent it'll be like, 50 percent of the heat, but I don't know that that's accurate. So... [laughs] New York City apartments.
Keith:        I heard a British guy one time say that Americans using central heating is bad and that actually, radiators rule.
Ali:        Huh.
Keith:        And I don't know why that would be, except for that, if you're not using a room, you don't have to heat it for no reason. That's a great reason to have a radiator.
Dre:        Yeah, that is a good reason.
Keith:        Uh, but I can't think of any other reason why that would be true, except for that, I will just believe it 100 percent of the time if someone says that the way that America does things is the worst way for no reason.
Ali:        [laughing] who can know?
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        Pause really quick. Potatonaut In the chat asks — is Polar good? This is the second time hearing it mentioned in two days — yes, it is good. I drink a lot of it. It's the only seltzer that I drink, because it doesn't have a weird aftertaste, like a weird chemical aftertaste.
Keith:        Tell me your least favorite seltzers.
Ali:        My least favorite seltzers... uh...
0:40:01.0        
Keith:        And, hey, and don't be afraid to like, step on some toes here.
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Yeah, no — yeah.
Keith:        Light 'em up, Ali. Let 'em know —
Ali:        Well I haven't measured — there's like, obviously like, I think Poland Spring makes seltzer that isn't very good. And I think that there are probably some Schweppes ones out there that aren't very good. Like your store —
Keith:        Sorry, what was the first one?
Dre:        Polar springs?
Ali:        Poland Springs.
Keith:        Polar Springs?
Dre:        Poland Springs.
Keith:        Poland Springs. Okay.
Dre:        Sure.
Ali:        Uh... and then like your store-brand seltzer, like, not worth it. Um, but yeah, I like this one. I, I, I... a lot of people don't like LaCroix, question mark?
Keith:        But also, a lot of people do.
Ali:        Right. It like, had a fad, but then people were like, oh, LaCroix people. And I don't find objectionable. I don't think it's as good, but — I don't, I don't —
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        People really talk down about it.
Keith:        I never understood the craze. Like, out of nowhere, it seemed like literally everyone was like, oh, the only reason I'm alive is because of LaCroix.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        And then it was like a year and a half later, and it was like, if I ever hear anybody saying they're drinking LaCroix at all, kick them in the knee.
Ali:        Wow.
Dre:        Ali, have you ever had a Focus?
Ali:        I haven't had a Focus.
Dre:        It's caffeinated sparkling water.
Ali:        Ooh!
Dre:        Yeah. Actually, it's a company that's based out of Louisville. But they're, like, all over now.
Ali:        Oh, wow.
Dre:        Or, I don't know. I'm not a big sparkling water person, but I like them. And also, caffeine, that's good.
Ali:        Sure. Yeah.
Keith:        Okay. Ali, you drink the Polar stuff, but have you had the Polar seltzer-ades?
Ali:        I haven't. I actually have the, I have the box.
Dre:        Wait, what is a seltzer-ade?
Ali:        It's seltzer mixed with lemonade, and additionally some other flavoring.
Dre:        Oh, that sounds good.
Ali:        Yeah. I have a box of blueberry lemonade on my table right now that's been sitting there for like 2 weeks, because I just keep getting... [laughs] the seltzer that I want, instead of drinking what's there.
Dre:        Oh, man. I want this tart cherry limeade seltzer-ade. This looks delicious.
Ali:        Come on down.
Keith:        I do really like the seltzer-ades. I think that a really good seltzer is delicious on its own, but a middling seltzer, it, uh, doesn't have enough flavor — it has just enough flavor to be annoying.
0:42:20.8        
Ali:        [laughing] Sure.
Keith:        Where you're like, “I have the vague suggestion of cherry, but I can't actually...” Like, if it was a little bit less or a little bit more it would be fine. But as it is, it's just like, hinting that I can taste something, but I actually can't.
Ali:        Yeah. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Keith:        But the seltzer-ades, I think, give... it's just got more flavoring in it, like it's still... like it doesn't, still doesn't have any like, sugar or whatever, like it's not sweet. But you're definitely like, oh, this really has a lot of flavor for seltzer. That's really what distinguishes it, I think.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay, yeah.
Keith:        Ton of flavor.
Ali:        I have the opportunity to report back on that, and maybe, eventually, I will.
Keith:        Okay.
Ali:        Okay. So I think that we have done phase 1 of this game.
Keith:        Yep. We hit Star Wars, we hit Polar.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        What do we talk about phase 2?
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        [laughing] Okay. So, we have our pyramid set up here. And then the way this is going to go is, as you remove a card from the pyramid, we recall a tale of our adventures. And then you can see the list here... a red king depicts a tragedy that affects only you. A black king depicts a fortunate event that affects only you. A pair of red cards depicts a tragic event for multiple parties. A pair of black cards depicts a fortunate event more multiple parties. And then a red and black pair depict a fortunate event for one party and a tragic event for another. And those are like, set in stone. The game also provides the... uh, like, chart that you see to the right, here, which can help you sort of generate what you want, the sort of tragedy or fortunate event to be, where it's either black high, could have, uh, a small monetary favor, you win an award, discovery of a hidden secret.
0:44:21.9        I should just read these, actually. [laughs] We don't have to use them, but I will read all of them. Uh, so, black 7 is a monetary favor, 8 is you win an award, 9 is you gain influence locally, 10 is, discover a hidden secret, Jack is you change someone's mind, and Queen is a favor from someone important. A King is, gain something life-changing. Someone else want to read the others? [laughing]
Keith:        In the red one, is that the —
Ali:        Yeah, please.
Keith:        Okay. Uh, a red 7, uh,, is a minor error. A red 8 is a dangerous mistake. A red 9 is, a bounty is put on you. A red 10 is a grave misunderstanding. A red Jack is a natural disaster. A red queen is the anger of a local authority. And a red King is the loss of something life-changing.
Ali:        Yeah. So, these are — [laughing]. This is the realm of possibility that we're working with here. And if you can see from our pyramid here, we have some, like, options to start with. We have the king we can just go for, there's this 9 and the 4...
Keith:        So, are we, do we have to start from the bottom?
Ali:        We do, yeah.
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        Because the ace, for instance, is covered by the 9 and the 4. So we have to clear the 9 and the 4 off of the...
Dre:        Right.
Ali:        Pyramid before the ace is playable. And it just goes like that.
Keith:        And you said there's something we have to be careful of in terms of the order we solve in...
Keith:        In terms... yeah, so like, if we, if we took the 9 and the 4 to the right, the 4 that wasn't right next to it, for instance, the one in the middle, we wouldn't be able to use the queen immediately to be able to grab that ace. And we would be kind of like, what do we do with this 4 now? Like, it would be annoying.
Keith:        Okay, gotcha.
Ali:        So you, you know, there's a little bit of strategy to it there. But like, if we hadn't noticed that, it wouldn't have been the [unintelligible]
Keith:        Okay. And here's a question, we almost... let's imagine that that's two 5s there, right?
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        We have no solves.
Ali:        If we have no solves, then what we would do is... draw a card from the deck, and then this 8 becomes playable.
Keith:        Oh, right. Okay.
Ali:        So we would do... and then we would just keep drawing until we had something playable, and then once we have... the way that like, pyramid solitaire works, I think, is that you could do this, and you can go through the deck to the bottom, flip it back over again once, and then re-use it, and then you can't do that anymore. But for this, the purposes of this game, it says once you don't have any playable moves, move on to the epilogue.
0:47:14.8        
Keith:        Gotcha.
Ali:        If we hit a dead end, then we will hit a dead end. Yeah, so here's what we're working with now. And I have a little cheat sheet in the corner in terms of numbers, just so you know numbers. Uh, I was playing a few games of pyramid solitaire today and just kept being like, 4 and 6, right? And then it just doesn't, it doesn't work.
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        And roll20 would not tell me that I was wrong about that, so I just decided to make a little chart here.
Dre:        Gotcha.
Ali:        So, I mean, this is some sort of top-level gaming here. Because we have the choice to pick whether we want a fortunate event, or a fortunate event for one party and a tragic event for another.
0:48:14.2        
Keith:        Uh... wait, you said we have a choice?
Ali:        Well, because we can either... we, we have two pairs that are possible here, which is the king, which is a 13 on its own —
Keith:        Oh, right.
Dre:        Oh, that's what I was forgetting, gotcha.
Ali:        And the 9-4. [laughing]
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        Yeah, the face cards, the king is 13, the queen is 12, and the jack is 11.
Dre:        11?
Ali:        Yeah.
Dre:        Okay.
Keith:        Gain something life-changing, or...
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        A bounty is put on you.
Ali:        Ooh.
Keith:        Gosh, well...
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        No, I have nothing. I mean —
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        I mean I don't have an opinion on which one should go first. I guess I lean towards, we should have a sort of motivating thing before we gain anything.
Dre:        That makes sense, yeah.
Ali:        Oh, sure sure sure. Be like, I started this adventure...
Dre:        That's how you start a hero's journey.
Ali:        Yeah. I had a bounty on me, and then I was... I had to travel out of town, and... yadda-yadda-yadda. [laughing]
Dre:        Sure, yeah. How all the great stories go.
Ali:        Okay. So, we're using the 9 and the 4 here, which is, a fortunate event for one party and a tragic event for another. And then I guess we're saying here, because it's the 9-high, the unfortunate event is for us, the person with the bounty. The fortunate event... person who's... [laughing] who's trying to hire someone to catch us?
Keith:        Mmm, maybe the vice president of the Friends of Po Lar —
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Oh.
Keith:        Now the de facto leader of the adventurer's guild.
Ali:        Woah.
Dre:         Yeah.
Ali:        Wait, wait wait wait, so this is, this got, this got... act 1. I don't know that this should be act 1, but.
Keith:        Scene 1.
Ali:        [laughing] So, our, so our vice president.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        We're the president, they're president with a vice included, is like, “I'm going to put a bounty on the president of the adventurer's guild so I can take it over?”
Keith:        Well, I don't know if, if the vice president put the bounty. But it is something fortunate for him.
Ali:        Oh...
Dre:        Mmm.
Keith:        I won't discount the idea that he has maybe forced the situation.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay, so that's up in the air.
Keith:        That's up in the air.
Ali:        But what's happening here is, Po Lar finds themselves with a bounty on their head. The vice president of the Friends of Po Lar is happy to take on more responsibility in Po Lar's absence.
Keith:        Absolutely.
Dre:        No new friends, man.
Ali:        You know, we're always questioning people's intentions, and, here we are.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        Number one. Okay. Yeah, I, I defaulted to they/them for Po Lar, and I think that I'm just going to —
Dre:        That's fine.
Ali:        Going once, once twice —
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        Okay. Po Lar. Uh... okay. So, wow. We've got to leave town. Uh...
Keith:        Are we leaving, are we leaving town in the dead of night, or are we like, publicly leaving town?
Ali:        Well, I don't think that it can be public if people are hunting us.
Dre:        Yeah, I think that's very much like a middle of the night kind of thing.
Keith:        Well, what if you're confident, what if you're extremely confident, that the reason you would leave town is to keep the town safe, not to keep yourself safe, because —
Ali:        Okay.
Keith:        Literally no one is a threat to you, as far as you, in your head.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:         Because it's true, this could be true in Po Lar's head.
Dre:        Okay, all right, so we're a big asshole.
Ali:        No.
Keith:        And people are going to be — well, this is complicated. This guy's basically the mayor.
Ali:        Okay. [laughing]
Keith:        I mean, he's the richest person in town, he owns the adventurer's guild, and they're famous, right?
Dre:        Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Keith:        So all of a sudden he disappears, or does he go, like, “okay, townsfolk, I'm leaving you in capable hands, I have this issue that I have to deal with.”
0:52:55.1        
Ali:        You are making such a jump from, we are hired hands, we are adventurers, we help people out, people like reading about our tales, to like — we are a governing body in this town, and people look to us for authority.
Keith:        Who — who else? Who if not us?
Dre:        That's true, who else?
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        An actual mayor, for instance.
Keith:        Is this — oh, oh, the fucking actual mayor's got more than us?
Ali:        [laughing] Like a governing council.
Keith:        No, absolutely never.
Dre:        No way. Mm-hm.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        The — the mayor is a groveling worm, if that. And is lucky that this is the town that I built the Friends of Po Lar in.
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        Okay, I think [unintelligible] Po Lar leaves the town.
Dre:        I think Keith's on point here.
Ali:        In an effort to keep danger from, from, in an effort to keep the town from being exposed to the danger that bounty hunters could bring. Uh... [laughing] [unintelligible] we're mayor. We are as, as a influential —
Dre:        We're mayor.
Keith:        I am the law.
Ali:        [laughing] in the town. I... the, uh, there is — bleh. Po Lar fears that things could go awry in their absence, [laughing] but trusts their vice — vice — vice president? How do we feel about that? That feel like an accurate sum-up of [laughing] what we just [unintelligible]
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        Yeah. Fuck, where's —
Ali:        Okay, act 1.
Keith:        Oh, there it is, okay. I like couldn't — sometimes I can't find the roll20 tab.
Ali:        Oh, sure sure sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I also just added this sort of big square here to be our quote/unquote adventuring log, and we'll have in our adventure. Okay. So, cool, okay, so... [laughing] act 1, leaving town with a bounty, some trepidation.
Keith:        Oh, wait, I actually can't see that, that's on the wrong layer.
0:55:23.5        
Ali:        Oh my god, really?
Keith:        Yeah. I can see the act 1, Po Lar finds themselves with a bounty, blah-blah-blah, but I can't see the rest of it. It ends in, Po Lar's absence, for me.
Dre:        Oh, I can see it, I think.
Keith:        What? What?
Dre:        Oh —
Keith:        I'll refresh, because —
Ali:        Yeah, maybe it didn't load in, because —
Keith:        No, I don't have...
Dre:        Oh, no, you're right, I don't. I was, I was looking at the YouTube and not roll20.
Ali:        It's the same, like...
Keith:        There it goes.
Dre:        Well now I see it, there it is.
Keith:        Oh, maybe you [unintelligible] clicked away.
Ali:        Oh, I probably didn't click out. Yeah.
Dre:        Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keith:        Roll20's weird.
Ali:        Roll20 is extremely weird. Uh... okay, so that is act 1. We have our little satchel, we have left the town.
Dre:        Yep.
Keith:        I will say, I, I want to leave it open, because — just because all of that's true, I, or at least that's what I believe about this place, that there could be no power greater than Po Lar in this town —
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        Does not necessarily mean that we had like, you know, a hand-wave ceremony, like, you know, a miniature bon voyage as we left. It still could be, in the cover of darkness, but —
Ali:        Okay.
Keith:        That is, my pitch for doing it publicly is that people are going to notice, and we might as well publicly pass the torch.
Ali:        Oh, sure sure sure. Okay, okay.
Keith:        But cover of night, if we want to do cover of night, that still could be, but I think that just means someone's going to go, “where the fuck did Po Lar go, why is, why is...”
0:56:58.5        
Ali:        Why is Po Lar not here? Oh, what's a good vice president name?
Keith:        No, well, yeah, I was going to say, why is the number two giving orders?
Dre:        Mmm.
Ali:        Yeah, well... um... and yeah, this is, I mean, the other people in the town are certainly things we can flesh out next time we need fortunate events for multiple parties, for instance. But, yeah, okay. Okay.
Keith:        I'm like... I could so use a seltzer right now.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay.
Keith:        I don't have anything in my — I have water and milk, and that's like, what I have in my house right now.
Ali:        Well...
Keith:        I'm going to text...
Dre:        Well, you know, water's like halfway there.
Keith:        I'm going to text Isaac and be like, “can you get me seltzer from Walgreens?”
Ali:        Ooh, good call. Do you have like one of those — [laughing] I was going to suggest using one of those like, milk foamers to like, make bubbly water, but I don't think that's how that works [laughing]
Dre:        What?!
Keith:        No. That is not how it works.
Ali:        Well... try harder.
Keith:        Not how it works.
Dre:        [laughing] Try harder? Yeah, that's the problem.
Keith:        You need one of those clown, you need one of those clown things, where you squirt —
Ali:        Oh yeah, okay, right right right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dre:        A sodastream?
Ali:        Uh-uh.
Keith:        Yeah, well, they have sodastreams, but they, I mean, those are just big, expensive versions of like, the whipped cream — people use them for whipped cream now, but you put the little CO2 charge in the thing and you close it. You fill that with water, and it's got a hose at the end instead of a star spout, and that's how people would make seltzer.
Ali:        Sure.
Keith:        I'm blanking on what they're called. I want one of those really, really bad. I do not want a sodastream, but I want one of those. Buy fancy salt, make some, like, lightly-salted seltzer.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay.
Keith:        It's real! Don't laugh at that, that's —
Ali:        No, no no no, I believe you, I, yeah, that sounds... good. [laughing] It sounded like I was lying there, but there are salty drinks. You can have salted rim stuff.
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        Also, salt enhances the flavor of whatever you're putting in there, right?
0:59:16.4        
Keith:        Soda siphon, that's what it's called, a soda siphon.
Dre:        Oh, damn.
Ali:        Ah.Ah-ha.
Keith:        I want a soda siphon. Yeah, a sodastream is like, “what if we took a soda siphon and pretended that it had to be huge and expensive?”
Ali:        Yeah, and then you have to like, trade in the things, and it's also...
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        Like, they're like made in Palestine, so like, don't... do that.
Dre:        Oh.
Keith:        No, they're made in Israel.
Ali:        Oh, right right right, yeah.
Keith:        Wrong one.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Hey, look, if they're made in Palestine, I'll buy a sodastream.
Ali:        Yep, yep.
Keith:        But, yeah.... here's a hint. Anyone go out and goes, “Wow, Keith loves the soda siphon, I should get a soda siphon.” First of all, that's weird, don't buy a soda siphon because you heard about it on a podcast.
1:00:01.7        
Ali:        [laughing] I keep thinking of doing it because it seems like —
Keith:        Second of all, buy a soda siphon, they are good — hm?
Ali:         I have all these cans around, and it's like, should I be like...
Keith:        Yeah. Yeah.
Ali:        Lowering my can usage...
Keith:        People got all these cans around. Here's the thing — because with the sodastream, right, you put in the packet, you put in a packet of juice, and it mixes them —
Ali:        Uh-uh.
Keith:        And you might go, okay, I'll put my juice in, I'll put my water, and I'll close the thing — don't do that, it'll explode.
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        Okay. [laughing]
Keith:        Carbonate the water on its own, and then pour it onto the syrup in your glass, and that's how you, that's how you do it. That's how, like, a soda fountain at a store does it, too. It's like, the very last step is to mix it.
Ali:        Right. Well just buy one of those. People buy arcane machines and put them in their homes, just get a soda fountain machine.
Keith:        Yeah, just buy a whole 7, get yourself like a 7 or 8 soda, soda fountain.
Ali:        I drink enough seltzer that like, at some point in my life I should just be thinking about getting a Freestyle machine, right? Because at the end of the day it's going to even out.
1:00:58.4        
Keith:        Oh my god. A Freestyle machine? You don't — absolutely do not want to be fucking with those 50-pound boxes of syrup.
Dre:        No, those things suck.
Keith:        Those things are — and you'll never drink one, you'll die before you can finish one, let alone [unintelligible]
Dre:        Sure.
Ali:        [laughing] Sure. Well, I can just email Polar and be like, can you please give me your raspberry lime juice?
Keith:        Please, Polar?
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Can I become an extremely local distributor of...
All:        [laughing]
Ali:        I have this restaurant, no, don't ask me what it is, don't ask me where it is, but I want to have Polar seltzer on tap.
Keith:        Hey, just make a fake restaurant, like that guy in the UK did.
Ali:        Wait, what?
Keith:        Oh, there was a guy who, in the UK, who made a restaurant, who like, gave an address and registered a fake phone number for a restaurant that was appointment-only, and then had a bunch of people, like friends and stuff, leave good reviews for it, and it spent a while as the number one restaurant in like, London, or something, despite it not being real.
Ali:        Wow.
Keith:        Because he just had a bunch of fake 5-star reviews, and it was extremely exclusive because it didn't exist and they never served any food. And it was just number one by —
Ali:        [laughing] Okay.
Keith:        By trickery. So do that, and then you can get some Polar.
Ali:        Sure. Okay, so we have two possible pairs. We either have this king which we can just take off of the board, or the queen and the ace.
1:02:35.8        And that is, either a fortunate event that affects only us, or a fortunate event for multiple parties.
Keith:        Okay.
Dre:        Mmm.
Ali:        Do we want to spread the wealth here, or do we want to, early in the story, be out on our own, you know, away from this bounty...
Dre:        Oh, so we can, we can pull pairs from multiple rows.
Ali:        Uh... so, we, the ace is now uncovered.
Dre:        Yeah, so we can use it and the queen —
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dre:        Got it. Okay, all right.
Ali:        But like, the 10, for instance or the 4 next to it, we can't use until we, we get rid of the 4 underneath it.
Dre:        Sure.
Ali:        Yeah. Uh...
Dre:        Hm, hm, hm.
Ali:        I feel like we could go one of two ways here, because it's either the story of like, this lonely journey, being on this bounty, and then like, you know, having this incredible thing happen to us, or like, you know, being on the run, but thing helping somebody, and being like, oh, Po Lar, you're a hero, you've [unintelligible] strife.
Dre:        Oh yeah.
Keith:        Oh, wait, do they recognize us, or do they not recognize us?
Ali:        Exactly.
Dre:        Oh, yeah.
Ali:        Yeah.
Keith:        This could be, this could be our Yoko Ono.
Ali:        [laughing] Context on that one? I don't know what you mean are —
Dre:        Yeah, I was going to say this could be our Emperor's New Groove, but you, you go ahead, Keith.
1:04:02.3        
Keith:        That's another, that's another good one. Uh... sorry, I thought everyone knew that Yoko Ono is shorthand for someone that you meet as a rich and famous person who doesn't understand who you are, and so you're able to form a legitimate friendship with them, which is something that your extremely sad famous-person life is lacking.
Ali:        Oh, true.
Dre:        And then our vice president will blame all of our guild's problems on her, later.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        Sure. Okay. [laughing] So, is this like, on our adventures we found someone to like, maybe like a hitchhiker or something, like we're traveling to a different city?
Keith:        Yeah. Well, what was your suggestion, that we help someone?
Ali:        Basically, yeah.
Keith:        Yeah, I guess we can figure out what that means. But, yeah, we help with, that's a fortunate event for 2 people. Someone gets helped, and we get a friend who doesn't understand that —
Ali:        Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keith:        That we're rich.
Ali:        Right.
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        I'm pitching your Yoko Ono situation, but like, we get a sidekick, is sort of what I was putting out there in terms of having a legitimate friend.
Keith:        No, no, no, I, yeah, yeah, you're totally right.
Ali:        Uh... okay, yeah.
Keith:        What do we save them from, what is the...
Ali:        Ooh. Uh... attacked by a big lizard? I don't know why I like [unintelligible]
Keith:        Oh, how big?
Dre:        Oh, I like big lizard.
Keith:        This could be anything — I'm going to give a scale here. The smallest lizard that is, attacked by a big lizard, I'm going to say is like, uh... for ease, I'm going to stick to well-known big lizards.
Ali:        Okay.
Keith:        I'm going to say komodo dragon.
Dre:        Yes, 100 percent.
Keith:        That's the smallest big lizard. Honestly, maybe a tegu is a big lizard that you can be attacked by —
Ali:        Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keith:        But then a bunch of people are going to be like, “what's a tegu?”
Ali:        What was the tegu we were obsessed with?
Keith:        No, that was a, that was a, that was a, that was a skink.
Ali:        Oh, sure sure sure, right right right, yeah yeah yeah. Uh-huh.
Keith:        Tegus are like the size of medium-sized dogs.
Ali:        Oh, yes, I know what you're talking about now, yeah, okay.
Keith:        And they have big jowls.
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah. Anyway, yeah, I don't know why my head is in like, traveling through the desert to a new city?
Keith:        I get that, I get desert.
Dre:        No, I'm down with that, yeah.
1:06:18.3        
Keith:        But here's the biggest — well, that gives us the big thing, is, krayt dragon.
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        We — we have to. [laughing]
Keith:        It's spelled CRATE.
Dre:        Well, it's not that it is a krayt dragon, it's just the size of one.
Ali:        Sure.
Keith:        And it's spelled CRATE.
Ali:        Krayt-dragon-esque.
Keith:        Okay, so I'll stop infringing on copyrights.
Ali:        Yeah, we just have to really [unintelligible]
Dre:        You can say dragon.
Ali:        We can just say dragon, dragons exist in —
Keith:        Dragon, yeah, that's the big...
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        It's just the size of something everyone knows the size of.
Ali:        Uh... yeah, yeah.
Dre:        Uh...
Ali:        Well... [laughing] red [unintelligible] let me just add that because it seems like important context. You can't see me doing this yet, [unintelligible]
Dre:        Hm.
Ali:        Okay.
Dre:        I mean, this is something life-changing. So...
Ali:        Oh, true, yeah.
Keith:        Oh, this was the king. Okay.
Ali:        No, this would be, if it's, uh, a fortunate event that affects multiple parties, it is the queen and the ace.
Dre:        Oh, right, okay. But so then it's a favor from someone important.
Ali:        It doesn't have to be, again. The chart is really just more of a...
Keith:        But we've already done that. We're the someone important giving a favor.
Ali:        Oh, see? Yeah. We end up there regardless. So, on a journey through a desert to — is desert, desert is one S? Or is that dessert?
Keith:        One S. Dessert is two, because you want two desserts.
Ali:        Oh my god. Yeah, you got me there. [laughing]
Dre:        Oh...
Keith:        You only ever want one desert. This is what a teacher taught me in second grade.
Dre:        That's like —
Ali:        Yeah.
Keith:        And to this day, I only have two desserts.
Dre:        There's a rat in separate.
Ali:        We meet a person being attacked by a large lizard. Uh... I, how would you describe the size of a krayt dragon if — horse-sized?
Keith:        I'll say — no, more like —
Dre:        No! Much bigger.
Keith:        Think of a European fantasy dragon.
Dre:        It's like a dinosaur.
Keith:        It's like that. It's like a European fantasy dragon. I was sort of being, I was being an asshole by saying everyone knows what size a krayt dragon is, and it's the only way to compare that size of dragon.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Yeah, it's like a big dinosaur, basically.
Ali:        So like, oh, so like a medium-sized T-Rex?
Keith:        Yeah, or like, what's the long-necks called? What are those?
Dre:        A brontosaurus?
Ali:        Oh, sure.
Keith:        Yeah, it's like, it's like brontosaurus-sized.
Ali:        Are we talking two stories or three, here?
Keith:        Three.
Ali:        Three stories! [laughing]
Keith:        Well, we — this is the range. Is it, is it a komodo dragon, all the way up to...
Ali:        Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. And we're putting max sliders on our dragon scale.
Keith:        Just to hedge, I don't need any Twitter messages about krayt dragons, krayt dragons are constantly being depicted as wildly different sizes, so...
Ali:        Yeah.
Dre:        It's true.
Ali:        Yeah. Okay. So we find this person being attacked by a big lizard. Uh... [laughing] and, save them from danger. Uh... and then, I... are we cool with the like, this person now accompanies — is now travel with us? We help this person navigate... to... the city... we're going to, I guess? Because, I mean, you know, it's just manners to be like —
Dre:        Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ali:        Hey, you got attacked by that dragon, do you want to like walk with me the rest of way, instead of being like, “well, good luck! Don't run into another dragon!”
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        Do we appreciate it — Do we immediately appreciate company, or do we have to learn that we made a friend?
1:10:40.4        
Ali:        Oh yeah, well...
Dre:        Mmm. And now we're back to Emperor's New Groove.
Keith:        Right. Dre, this is exactly what I was thinking when you... when you said Emperor's New Groove, I had in my had that we have to make sure we know —
Dre:        Uh-huh.
Keith:        Whether it is Emperor's New Groove or is it —
Ali:        I never saw that, I don't know —
Keith:        Mulan, I guess.
Ali:        I don't know what you're referencing.
Keith:        You haven't seen Emperor's New Groove?
Ali:        I've never seen it.
Keith:        Wow.
Dre:        Wow. Where the emperor is like snotty and he turns into a llama?
Ali:        I've seen GIFs. I know that that happens, but I have not watched that.
Keith:        I'm trying to decide whether —
Dre:        Is that David Spade?
Keith:        To say, check it out. But it probably is no, right?
Ali:        Oh, sure. Well... I'm sure, I mean...
Keith:        It definitely is a movie I loved as a kid, but I can't —
Dre:        Yeah. I have not watched it —
Keith:        [unintelligible] suss out whether —
Ali:        [unintelligible] we aged out of it, at the time, so it didn't, I did not watch it.
Dre:        Yeah, I was a little kid when it came out.
Ali:        Sure. [laughing] uh... I guess it's an important question, though. Do we, are we fast friends or not, I guess is something we're thinking about.
Dre:         Mmm. Because that also is like, how trusting are we, knowing that we have a bounty on our head?
Ali:        True.
Keith:        That's a good point, so I would say, not super trusting.
Ali:        Okay.
Keith:        And I'll say this. I don't know that this isn't the assassin.
Ali:        Right?
Dre:        That's true. Maybe the dragon was a ruse.
Keith:        Or, maybe the assassin just got caught by a dragon, like legitimately did.
Dre:        Ooh. Well now it's a will-they, won't-they?
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Right. Well... yeah. It is, it is a, it's a friends to lovers, and then from the other end it's a will-they, won't-they — sorry, no, it's enemies to lovers.
Ali:        Right.
Keith:        Because they don't know, one of them doesn't know that they're enemies.
Ali:        Becoming close to someone while being hunted, ba ba ba...
Keith:        Tough to make friends.
Ali:        Yeah.
Keith:        Tough to make friends when you're the billionaire adventurer guild master mayor of a small town. Or is it a big town?
Dre:        Medium.
Ali:        What's a nice way of saying charity? Like someone who's like... [laughing]
Keith:        Chival....Chivalry.
Ali:        Chivalry. You know, someone who wants to give their stuff away and support people around them.
Keith:        Oh.
Dre:        Selflessness?
Ali:        Sure.
Dre:        Being an empath.
Ali:        [laughing] Uh... what I've written here is, “on a journey through the desert to escape our bounty hunter, we meet a person who is being attacked by a large lizard slash European fantasy dragon slash three-story-sized beast, and save them from danger.”
Dre:        [laughing] Uh-huh.
Ali:        We help this person navigate to the city we're going to, despite hesitations about becoming close to someone while being hunted. Po Lar's sense of justice and chivalry leads them to be a guide for this new person.
1:14:23.7        Uh... which is why I was asking. Which seems fine.
Dre:        I think chivalry makes sense there.
Ali:        Yeah. Do we want to give this person a name, do we want to describe them being — Saul, I am looking for generosity, thank you for the chat on that win. Chivalry is right.
Keith:        Actually, I was, yeah, I was just about, I just noticed that.
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        But... generosity is the one. Thank you. There's so many words.
Keith:        Chivalry is a knight word, though.
Ali:        Uh — sure.
Keith:        Generosity I think, is, is more what the sentence wants.
Ali:        Sure. I'm putting a slash there because I think they're both right.
Keith:        What's — our name's Po Lar. What's the name of our, of our second...?
Ali:        I came up with Po Lar, so... [laughing] it's someone else's turn.
Dre:        Shit... what am I drinking? Uh...
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Ali, debatable that you came up with Po Lar.
Ali:        Woah! I said it. I brought it to the table.
Dre:        What about Burt.
Keith:        For our second?
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        Burt? Po Lar and Burt.
Keith:        And then now we need one for this new person.
Ali:        Oh, the vice president is named Burt.
Keith:        Yeah, the vice president — we never named the vice president.
Ali:        Okay, okay, smart, okay, yeah.
Dre:        When you said second, I thought you meant like, our new friend.
Keith:        No, I meant like, the second in command. Burt is a friend name. So I see that, I see that.
Ali:        Did I just double this by trying to... no, okay, I was just... roll20 is weird. Okay. The [unintelligible] vice president, the vice president's name is Burt. Okay. And then the new person's name is going to be... [laughing]
Keith:        Well is it going to be more like Burt, or is it going to be more like Po Lar?
1:16:39.7        
Ali:        Names can be anything.
Keith:        Pascal.
Ali:        Pascal, yeah.
Keith:        Has Friends at the Table had a Pascal?
Ali:        I don't think we've had a Pascal yet.
Keith:        There we go.
Ali:        I'm surprised we haven't had a Pascal. Uh...
Keith:        Yeah, everyone's been waiting for a Pascal, I think.
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        [laughing] We help Pascal... also, I'm not using any capital letters, and I don't know why I've been doing that, but...
Dre:        Who cares?
Keith:        It's 2022. [unintelligible]
Ali:        Yeah. You know, this is like an adventuring journal, we're on the run here, we can't really be worried about punctuation.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        Yeah, this is, if anything, this is chicken scratch.
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        That's true. [laughing] For Pascal. Pascal be... do we, you know, do we want to say — I guess we don't know, Pascal is a question mark right now, but does Pascal have a cover story if... you know.
Dre:        Oh, so are we —
Keith:        It would either be true or false, but it has to exist.
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        So, Pascal, what's your story? I will... get back to you on that!
Ali:        Right, yeah, yeah. Maybe like a merchant? Maybe somebody who, who's out there in the desert looking for herbs?
Keith:        Dragon eggs.
Ali:        Dragon eggs, oh, sure, yeah. Well just, yeah. A merchant, a gatherer. Someone who's —
Dre:        A gather — yeah.
Ali:        Gathering things to sell at the market of the big city that we're going to. Across the desert. Okay. So, it's us and, and Pascal. And, here we are. We have a fortunate event that affects only us. It could possibly be gaining something life-changing. But... if our hearts take us elsewhere on this prompt, we could decide something else.
Keith:        Something life-changing, huh? That's big.
Ali:        You know?
Keith:        I want to do something life-changing. I think that we should change our lives.
Ali:        Okay. But, what about our life needs change at this point?
Dre:        Woah.
Ali:        Right?
Keith:        Okay. Well, a big one is, a big one is, I mean, I feel like it's early to solve the assassination thing.
Ali:        100 percent, yeah.
Keith:        But that would be a change, would be not being assassinated.
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Keith:        [laughing] I'm noticing... I'm noticing that we're not at the temple yet.
Ali:        Oh, true.
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        I think, I had kind of forgotten about the temple and the deity.
Ali:        [laughing] Well, you know, this is an act, act 4 or 5 situation — maybe that's something life-changing that —
Keith:        Oh yeah, by the way, we're doing 5 acts, this is a 5-act play here.
Ali:        Well, it's however many moves we end up with, so it'll probably be a bit. But maybe that's the life-changing event, that we go, we say to Pascal, “hey, nice to meet you, we've got to go,” because we don't trust Pascal, right? And then we're like, talking to an innkeeper, or, you know, we go to buy some cheese or something, and somebody's like, “hey, I'm sensing that you're feeling torn, you're feeling upset, you're feeling like you can't trust these things. I can sense these things on you. And I think that you should go to this forgotten temple.”
1:20:23.3        
Keith:        I remembered the temple.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        But it's otherwise forgotten.
Ali:        Right, right right right. Or maybe it's not something as direct as than we hear people talking about like —
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        You know, “remember when there used to be that old temple over there?” And the temple still is over there but it's behind a waterfall, and maybe we're going behind the waterfall just trying to destress a little bit.
Keith:        Maybe the people that are trying to get us to visit the temple are thralls of the temple —
Ali:        Ooh.
Dre:        Ooh.
Keith:        That exist only to funnel souls to be eaten, to be consumed, by, uh, by this priest's grief-stricken, uh, uh, zealotry.
Ali:        I, I think, I think, you know, being confronted by a thrall of a temple is pretty life-changing.
Keith:        But it has to be good.
Ali:        Ooh. [laughing]
Keith:        But yeah, I mean, it is —
Dre:        [laughing]
Keith:        Sorry, what — it was a king by itself, and so it's not, it is... gain something life-changing, but none of the other prompts. It doesn't have to be two things.
1:21:34.1        
Ali:        It's, uh... depicts a fortunate event that affects only you. So it has to be like a personal thing, instead of being like, for instance, Pascal is not gaining anything from this. Maybe that's, well, yeah. Maybe it could be... I mean, I feel like seeing a vision... [laughing] being like, you know, a thrall of the temple being like, “I can see the depths of your soul, and I can see your anxiety and your lack of trust for the people around you, go to this temple...”
Dre:        Mmm.
Ali:         And you're like, “damn, I've gained something life-changing here.”
Keith:        Oh, so you're saying that this person's —
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Like, sort of existential issues have been externalized by the thrall sort of coincidentally.
Ali:        Yes, yes, yes.
Keith:        Okay, sure. Yeah. I'll, I'll agree, I'll agree to that stretch.
Ali:        Laughing. Or I mean, we could just find, maybe we could find like a map?
Keith:        The tension — because obviously the tension is, how do you give something life-changing and get to this temple that we have to get to, which obviously is where a malevolent deity lives — [laughing]
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        Or we could say, we could say like, we could say like... uh... you know, Pascal, in their, uh, you know, thankfulness for the thing gives us like a magical compass or whatever, and we get led to — like we don't have to do, you know what I mean, we can have the thralls come up later, to not sully the fortune, is the tension you're speaking to here, I think.
Dre:        I actually, I think maybe even I do like the original thing.
Ali:        Okay.
Keith:        I don't even care that this thrall is leading me to a haunted temple. I do, I did need my, I did need my issues externalized by someone else.
Ali:        You know?
1:23:43.3        Upon arriving to the town, Po Lar separates from Pascal and continues trying to hide. Uh... nightmare situation, overnight? On a lonely night — I almost started, a lonely night alone, which is very [unintelligible]
Dre:        I mean, you know, hey.
Ali:        Po Lar is visited by —
Keith:        Three ghosts!
Ali:        [laughing] a thrall spirit —
Keith:        Ghost of temple past...
Ali:        By enthralled spirits that sense... their... uh... lack of trust?
Keith:        Why does Scrooge have a clock that tolls at 1? Right?
Dre:        What?
Ali:        Well, it's because clocks toll every hour.
Keith:        Why would you make a clock that tolls when I'm trying to sleep?
Ali:        But — because it does it every single hour to say, “hey, it's a new hour.”
Dre:        Yeah. Because back in the day, you couldn't like, turn it off and on.
Keith:        You're saying that there was no way to build an old-timey clock that was silent from like 8 PM to 6 AM?
Dre:        Probably not.
Ali:        I'm just saying, they didn't, you know, have solar chips or whatever.
Keith:        I don't know, just don't put a chime in on those hours, it feels like, right?
Ali:        [laughing] no, because, what if it's 10 AM and you're like, I've got a meeting at 10 AM, I'm waiting for this chime — your freaking clock thinks it's 10 PM and you're not getting your chime?
Keith:        No, wait — I think we're not — have it toll at all the important hours, but then not toll at the sleepy hours, like 1 AM.
Dre:        I'm Googling...
Ali:        There's overlap.
Dre:        How clocks work.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        There's overlap? Where, why is there overlap?
Ali:        Because the clock, it's only 1 through 12, right?
Keith:        Oh, because there's 24 of them. Sorry, Ali, say it again?
Ali:        But the clock, the clock mechanical only does 1 through 12, but it does it twice. So if you turn off the 10 PM chime... it's not going to know the difference between 10 PM and 10 AM.
Keith:        Uh... so, I don't know what clocks were like in, in his day, but clocks actually used to not have faces, and so it very well may have been a faceless chiming clock, not, not a 12-faced clock with... 24 different times built into it.
Dre:        Uh... yeah, it's looking like, this is, this is over my head. But it's looking like, if you're talking about a classic clock, I don't think there's a way for you to make it only chime or certain hours.
Keith:        What? Damn. That's — so you're saying they invented the — so, the clock didn't exist, and then someone was like, “I have a thing that wakes you up every hour!”
Dre:        Well, I mean, so you could get a clock that doesn't make a noise, or makes a less intense noise. But you couldn't get a clock that only makes a certain noise at a certain time.
Keith:        Okay. I'll pass, but okay.
Dre:        Until now. Until now.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Until now! It's the first commercial, is for a clock.
Dre:        Mm-hm. Yeah.
Ali:        [deep breath]
Keith:        Thanks, Dre.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        Act 3. Upon arriving to the town, Po Lar separates from Pascal and continues to hide — on a lonely —
Keith:        What's that like?
Ali:        Huh?
Keith:        What is separating from Pascal like?
Ali:        Oh, sure. Well, you know. Happy to help, glad to have you, that you're safe in the town now, but now I've got to go.
Keith:        Right.
Dre:        It's bittersweet.
Keith:        So, our motive is just like, “look, Pascal was good company, but I have shit to do, and he's safe, so...”
Dre:        Oh.
Ali:        Right. Well, now this is opening up for Pascal to come later, friend or foe, question mark, right? [snorts laughing]
Keith:        Yeah. Total question mark. You can't just be like, “I can't explain why, but I really want to stay right next to you.”
Ali:        Right? Right?
Keith:        Coming on a little strong either way.
Ali:        Also, this is speaking to the, the trepidation in our soul, to be like, I'm not really trying to make friends right now, I'm not here to make friends.
Keith:        Right. Not here to make friends, I can't make friends.
Ali:        I'm here to hide from a bounty hunter.
Keith:        I can't — I won't explain why, but...
Ali:        [laughing] On a lonely night, Po Lar is visited by enthralled spirits that sense their troubled spirit — I shouldn't have used troubled — [laughing] I shouldn't have used spirits there twice. Uh... Po Lar has struggled with their relationships, unable to trust those around them — the spirits encourage Po Lar to travel to the forgotten temple to cleanse their soul. That feel like an honorable recap of what we've just set up here? [laughing]
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        Okay, cool. Perfect. And now, we're a little bit in the danger zone here. We have to start drawing cards before we can make a new pairing. We have a, we have an active 8, and we have an active 4. And beyond that, we... you know, we need — yeah. Uh... two, two's not going to do it. 10's not going to do it.
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        5... is going to do it. 8 and a 5.
Keith:        5, yeah, that'll do it. Yeah.
Ali:        Okay, here we go.
Keith:        Yep. Uh... but that is not good, we're then going to have to draw a lot. I think we can only, we only have a 9 to work with.
Ali:        Yeah, we will only have an exposed 4. Yeah. Well, we can get like a king and then just be like, we have a king, and that's cool. But yeah, it's going to get, it's going to get a little dicey for us. Uh, so this is [deep breath] a pair of red and black cards, which is a fortunate event for one party, and a tragic event for another.
Dre:        Oh, we win an award!
Ali:        Sure.
Keith:        How is this going to work? [laughing]
Ali:        See, this is the thing where we do not — we are not beholden, the chart is merely suggestion.
Keith:        Oh, is it? I thought —
Dre:        Okay, but I want to win an award.
Keith:        I thought I heard you say set in stone?
Ali:        No, okay, so the only thing that's like a rule, like an actual rule, is the —
Keith:        Okay.
Ali:        The red and black, the black, the pair of resident. All of that stuff is a rule. The, um...
Dre:        Gotcha
Ali:        The chart is something that the designer of the game provides as like a starting point, but is not [unintelligible]
Keith:        I misheard you. Woah, I stretched and got like a wicked headrush.
Dre:        But, but, if we were to win an award at Pascal's expense, what would the award be?
Ali:        At Pascal's expense?
Keith:        Oh, wait, does that mean —
Dre:        Yeah, that's how we get brought back together.
Keith:        Wait, so at — say again, Dre?
Dre:        Like, we get the award Pascal wanted, and so Pascal doesn't get it.
Keith:        Oh, I thought — [laughing] I thought at Pascal's expense like the award was somehow mean to Pascal, like weekly, who fucking saved idiot Pascal again, award. Which obviously doesn't make sense. There can't be a who-saved-Pascal this week, because he was always fucking up...
Ali:        [laughing] Yeah. I don't want to like, lead us off of this path. But I'm just wondering how it would come to pass that both us and Pascal are up for the same thing, right? [laughing]
Keith:        I think that we're relatively anonymous in this town, also.
Ali:        Has Pascal been searching for this temple? Has Pascal been searching their whole lives to find the forgotten temple of yadda-yadda, and we get there first?
Keith:        And then whose — which body is giving us an award for that?
Ali:        [laughing] I don't know —
Dre:        [laughing]
Keith:        [laughing uproariously] it's just a big drumroll and like a light show — [announcer voice] welcome to the forgotten temple! [laughing]
Dre:        [providing background game show music]
Keith:        No one's been here in 35 years except... two adventurers!!!
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Point to a skeleton — [announcer voice] Bones! Tell 'em what they've won!
Ali:        [laughing] Sure.
Dre:        Rattle rattle rattle rattle rattle.
Ali:        Yeah, are we —
Keith:        [announcer voice] All expense paid trip to the... malevolent deity!
Ali:        [laughing] Are we just going from Star Wars to Emperor's New Groove to Aladdin here? Where we get to this temple and there's a fucked up genie who sings us a song and gives us an award? Like is that what we're...
Keith:        Yeah, that's what it is, yeah.
Dre:        Uh-huh.
Keith:        [singing] This temple's been forgotten...
Ali:        [cackling] Wow, okay, sure, okay. Uh... right.
Dre:        I'm, I'm waiting for Keith to write the rest of the song.
Keith:        [singing] This temple's been forgotten — you two will spend the night... inside the haunted... god and he will... bite your head tonight!
All:        [laughing]
Keith:        It's the Muppet Show song.
Dre:        Yeah, no, I — yeah.
Ali:        Wow, okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Black 8, plus red 5, act 4. Uh... Po Lar makes for the temple, uh... and Pascal follows? We go to this temple, right, because the spirits told us to.
1:33:22.9        Pascal, question mark merchant, we don't know, who knows — follows us.
Dre:        Who knows.
Keith:        I would like to know, though, if Pascal's a murderer and is looking to kill us, we know why they're following.
Ali:        Okay, right.
Keith:        If that's not true, we don't know why they're following. Do we have any ideas why...
Ali:        Okay. We don't have to make that decision right now in the story, right? Pascal follows... uh, also, in search of the forgotten temple. This is what Pascal's saying, right? This is why this is a, this is why this is a tragic event for Pascal, because Pascal wanted to find this forgotten temple, and here we are, at the temple before them. Right?
Keith:        Here we are.
Ali:        Here we are.
1:34:14.3        Uh... also, in search of the forgotten temple. Upon entering... [laughing] the forgotten temple, Po Lar is... Po Lar meets... is it a genie, or is it like, is it like, like a, like a, like a crave keecher — a... a cave. A cave creature.
Dre:        A cave creature?!
Ali:        Who talks and is like, you've got to watch out, man, there's this malevolent spirit here... by the way, here's this award.
All:        [laughing uncontrollably]
Dre:        You've got the nicest shirt I've seen in 200 years!
Ali:        [laughing] [coughs]
Keith:        It's — you're the one who knew that the award was not necessary.
Ali:        I don't want to be the person who's saying, “hey, I don't think that's a good idea,” when people are excited about this prompt. Okay. Meets a cave frog who... awards them with... okay. I've decided that they meet a frog in the cave who awards them with... do we want to be bestowed?
Keith:        Instead of a cave creeper they meet a frog or something.
Ali:        [laughing] Well, I said creature, and I've narrowed down creature to frog. It's a frog that talks —
Dre:        I dig this.
Ali:        And bestows awards, right?
Keith:        Is there a little pond in there, or is this a non-water frog?
Ali:        Well, we did establish that you have to get through a waterfall to go into the cave.
Dre:        Mmm, this is true.
Keith:        Excellent point, yeah, totally.
Ali:        Yeah. [laughing] You can imagine it's humid in there, at the very least.
Keith:        Sold, say no more. Frog, it makes it perfect sense.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        [unintelligible] frog.
Dre:        Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Ali:        Do we want to be awarded with like... uh... is it just like a title? Or is it like... is this why the deity eventually gets mad at us?
Dre:        Ooh.
Ali:        Because it's like, oh, we're bestowing on you, you're going to be the new priest. But then that seems, I don't know that that's like a win for us, 100 percent, because I don't know that we want to stay here for the rest of our lives.
Keith:        This was a high 8, right?
Ali:        A high 8.
Keith:        Which is, something fortunate for us... but not... okay.
Ali:        And the tragic event here is that, we... we're... we got here for Pascal, who — according to Pascal but who knows — wanted to be the person who discovered this temple. And we are being bestowed something from this frog that Pascal is now going to miss out on, which is a tragedy. And is that bestowing like, do we get like a cave ring? Or do we get like —
Keith:        [laughing]
Ali:        This frog [laughing], this frog being like, “and now you're... Sir Temple,” or whatever the fuck.
Dre:        Okay.
Keith:        What if the frog comes with us — well, I'm complicating it. Because... what the fuck, what the fuck to we need any material thing, an award?
Ali:        Oh, sure.
Dre:         Sure.
Keith:        I have piles of awards and titles. This is...
Ali:        But these are all titles from people who are, you know, subscribed to your adventurer's guild catalog. This is like a pure, unadultered... somebody being like, “wow, you did a great thing.”
Keith:        Okay. I'm, okay, I'm the cynical Po Lar.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        If you said that to me, I as Po Lar, I'm not buying... this means, this means nothing, this is not fortunate for me.
Ali:        Okay.
1:38:16.6        
Keith:        Because, because I think — I showed up here, someone in the town told me that I should come here?
Ali:        Not somebody — enthralled spirits came to you and spoke the truth of your soul to you, and you came here.
Keith:        Right.
Ali:        And then you come here, and you're bestowed with an award.
Keith:        But it really doesn't feel like I did anything for this award.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay.
Dre:        Hm... mm-hm.
Keith:        More empty gestures from an empty world.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay. We still don't know what the fuck... [laughing] that doesn't answer my question of whether it should be like a ring or like a fancy spell, or like —
Keith:        It's a ring, it's a really big ring.
Ali:        Or, you know, I think Dre had suggested the companionship of this frog. But then again, our heart is closed. Maybe that's the award, is — a familiar is different than somebody who takes a check from you, you know.
Dre:        Ooh.
Keith:        Okay, this is interesting. That's an interesting...
Ali:        You know? [laughing]
1:39:26.4        
Keith:        Uh... okay. Here's what we, here's what I'm doing.
Ali:        Okay. [laughing]
Keith:        Now, award, let's just add a space between the A and the W, now we are, we have, we win a little frog that we have to take care of.
Dre:        Yeah, that's our new ward.
Keith:        A ward.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        This is our baby frog, he is...
Ali:        Becomes.
Keith:        He becomes our little frog.
Ali:        Our little frog slash ward slash familiar. Pascal is incredibly, incredibly —
Keith:        Good with frogs.
Ali:        Jealous. [laughing] and follows from a safe distance, not wanting to be discovered.
Keith:        Why does Pascal, why does Pascal want to find this temple?
Ali:        You know, I think that we're still leaning question marks for Pascal. I could see... I could see, okay.
Keith:        Yeah, sure. Play to find out what happens.
Ali:        You know. But, okay, so there's two things here, which is the obvious, Pascal is trying to kill us, coming to the temple because we're here, whatever. But, if Pascal is this, like, merchant. Pascal doesn't have the fan club, you know? Pascal isn't selling journals and, you know, glass figures to people who... already respect him.
1:40:54.7        Pascal is going out there, fighting these fucking dragons, looking for dragon eggs, looking for crystals... and has to sell them on the market, and is like, “I heard about this temple with all of this stuff in it, I've been looking for this temple.” And now here we are, not only finding the temple first, but getting this frog.
Keith:        Okay.
Dre:        Hm.
Ali:        You with me? [laughing]
Keith:        Yeah. No, I'm with you.
Ali:        Okay. Okay. Okay. And, I, I've included here that we have not noticed Pascal. I don't know, this just seems like the flavor for what I feel like is the right thing right now. [laughing] But, I could see why somebody would want to ask that. But... Pascal, lurking in the shadows behind us in the secret temple before, question mark question mark question mark, is Pascal good or bad? Makes sense to me.
1:41:54.6        
Keith:        Hey guys, I'm going to be right back. I need like three minutes. Isaac got locked outside.
Ali:        Mm-hm. We can just take an actual break.
Dre:        Oh yeah.
Keith:        Okay.
Dre:        Sure.
Keith:        Actual break is fine.
Ali:        Yeah. Be back in 5?
Keith:        Yeah, I'll be back in 5.
Ali:        Yeah, we've been doing this for 2 hours, we can take a break.
Keith:        Has it been two hours?
Dre:        Oof!
Keith:        All right, bye.
Ali:        Okay. We'll be right back. Bye, everybody.
1:53:19.2        I'm literally unmuting us right now. Keith is doing a live unboxing...
Keith:        I'm doing a live unboxing... cardboard box, from —
Dre:        Okay, can you tap on it?
Keith:        [taps on box]
Dre:        Thank you.
Keith:        Sent, it's sent from... Monassus, Virginia. I've opened it up. It's got big bubble wrap. Big kind, large style bubble wrap. Loosened box, sign of quality. Oh, this thing's made of metal, I didn't expect that. This is, uh, this is a Milwaukee-brand, uh, level.
Dre:        Oh yeah.
Ali:        A level?
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        Yeah, like the green liquid with a little dot inside?
Ali:        Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dre:        Milwaukee, Milwaukee makes good stuff.
Keith:        And it is a, it's a rotatable, it's a tiny little level in a rotatable chassis, so you don't need the long thing with multiple different angled levels, because this thing will sit an any angle, and you just have a, you have a radial dial that tells you what degree you set to.
Ali:        Oh... huh.
1:54:34.7        
Keith:        So you can be like, okay, I've set to zero degrees, let's see it this is level at 0 degrees.
Ali:        Oh, sure sure sure sure sure, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah.
Keith:        And then you can unlock it, flip it, and be like, okay, now it's at... it's 90 degrees, let's see if this is level at 90 degrees.
Ali:        What do you —
Keith:        Desk is not level. Desk is not level.
Ali:        Okay. Is that why you — this is what you were getting to the bottom of?
Keith:        No, it's just here.
Ali:        Okay. [laughing]
Keith:        I'm surprised at the build of this thing. It looked like it was going to be... it's 2022, so whenever I see something, I'm like, that's plastic. But, this is metal.
Ali:        Oh, sure, yeah. Well... you know.
Keith:        Love it. It's substantial, I'll say.
1:55:17.9        
Ali:        They don't make 'em like they used to, except when they try to.
Keith:        They really do not make them like they used to.
Ali:        Hi! So, we're back from break, uh, uh, we took a little break there.
Keith:        And we had a bonus segment.
Ali:        And we had a bonus segment, a bonus unboxing live on air. Uh... you gonna come back with, you know, you have to test out the level a little bit before you can say any —
Keith:        Oh yeah, I need three weeks of testing.
Ali:        Okay, yeah. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things to, you know, look into on that one.
Keith:        To level, yeah.
Ali:        [laughing] But yeah, so we've been following the story of Po Lar here, Po Lar the knight, head of the — rich head of the adventurer's guild. Who, got a bounty put on their head, so they left home, putting their friend, vice president Burt, in charge of the adventurer's guild to, travel across the village to a town where they could be anonymous.
1:56:25.8        On the way, they... [laughing] they saved a person named Pascal from a big lizard... journeyed with —
Keith:        No, a big lizard.
Ali:        A big lizard.
Dre:        A big lizard.
Ali:        A three-story-sized beast, is what we have written here.
Keith:        And how did that go? Like, are we, we're just extremely impressive, right?
Ali:        Yeah. What do you mean, how did — I mean, we, we saved them.
Keith:        But is it just like, you know, one, two, snick-snack...?
Ali:        I guess we, we have, we don't have, we didn't —
Keith:        Was it a hard-fought battle?
1:57:07.8        
Ali:        Aren't they all, you know?
Keith:        Wow.
Dre:        Mm-hm. Yeah.
Ali:        [laughing] We haven't established like, Po Lar's gear set here, for instance. We don't know if that... you know. Is Po Lar DPS? Is Po Lar melee? Is Po Lar a magician? Like, what are we, I mean, we can come to that later in the story, I guess, but we have not fleshed that out. Anyway...
Keith:        No, I agree, and, you know.
Ali:        [laughing] Helped Pascal journey to a new city, separate from Pascal, have a weird nightmare about some ghosts saying, “Po Lar, there's something wrong with your soul, you have to go to the secret temple to cleanse your soul.”
Keith:        And they have been feeling that.
Ali:        True, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. [laughing]. Po Lar goes to the temple, finds a frog who becomes our ward slash familiar slash little frog. Uh... Pascal, following behind us, is incredibly jealous.
Keith:        Or, is looking to kill us.
Ali:        Well, yeah. Both, maybe.
Dre:        I mean, both, yeah.
Keith:        Oh, so you think that if, regardless of if Pascal is an assassin or not, they wanted to go to this temple?
1:58:26.5        
Ali:        Well, because it has to be a tragic event for Pascal either way. Like, it would be a good event for Pascal if it was like, oh, I'm traveling, I'm following my bounty successfully, you know what I mean?
Keith:        It did have to be a tragic event, yeah.
Ali:        Right. Or maybe, there's two sides to this coin with Pascal, every time. Because for Pascal, it could be a tragic event because it's like, “oh, shit, my fucking bounty now has a fucking magical frog, and this is going to be harder now.” What's the tragedy for Pascal? We still don't know.
Keith:        But the other side is, my target is about to go into this death temple. I guess they don't know it's a death temple.
Ali:        Well... right, yeah. Yeah.
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        [laughing] I like the way that this game ended up for us, because we had a lot of like, obvious pairings in the beginning, so we could kind of like make some decisions for what the story was, and now it's all heart of the cards. What we get, we're going to get, and that's what it's going to be.
Keith:        We don't get upset.
Ali:        [laughing] Sure. Uh, so let's draw until we get a, what we're looking for is a 9. A three is not going to do it.
Dre:        Uh-uh.
Keith:        Shit! I'm upset.
Ali:        [laughing] I'm moving a bunch of text there, sorry about that.
Dre:        And you said if we run out of cards, we just go straight to the epilogue?
Ali:        Yeah. Mm-hm.
Dre:        Okay.
Keith:        That's going to be grim.
Ali:        This is all, because like, a pure game of, uh, pyramid solitaire or whatever, you would have the full deck and you would just go through it and you would be doing this for fun on your own. But we had those 10 cards in the beginning and we removed them from the deck. So there's like, some pairs that, you know, might not even be possible in there now.
Dre:        Oh... gotcha.
Keith:        But we, we do have, I think, three 9s in the deck, still.
Ali:        Yeah, I guess we, we have only seen one 9 so far, unless we saw it before...
Keith:        I do not believe that we did.
Ali:        Okay, yeah. Well, we'll see.
Keith:        [singsong] Who knows?
Ali:        [singsong] Who knows? Ooh, a king. A black king. Wait, where did it go? Where did the card just go? [laughing].
Keith:        No, I see it, it's right there. You're breaking up, also.
Ali:        Oh? Hello? Hi.
Keith:        No, you're good now. You did have one robot sentence.
Ali:        Okay. I've had such weird stuff with my internet. And somebody like came to my apartment and like, fixed it, and now it's still weird. Anyway.
Keith:        It was funny, the king disappeared or something for you, right?
Ali:        Yes.
Keith:        I saw it the whole time, but when that happened —
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        Nothing happened on my screen, it just stayed the way it should have been, but you were like [robot voice] “Oh, no!”
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre and Keith:        [laughing]
Ali:        Well, my internet was being visited by an enthralled spirit. So, anyway, so we now have a fortunate event that only affects us. We are in this cave, and we have found... a fortune.
Dre:        We've already got one of those.
Ali:        You know? And this is also another gain something life-changing. See, this is why we want to...
Keith:        It's, I'll say this. Here's what I'll say.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        We have created that guy that, we won so much, he has so much wealth and power, that nothing — that his biggest weakness is that nothing in life is real to him, and all he keeps getting is more and more. He has had, every single card that we've had has been something good for him.
2:02:02.9        
Ali:        Uh... [laughing] sure, — the, the power is a question mark. That was up in the air — I mean, but, yeah, true.
Keith:        But this one isn't. Black king —
Ali:        These are — we established somebody who has a guise of power and influence, but also is like, very trepidatious about their relationships, is very lonely, is very insecure.
Dre:        Mm-hm. Right.
Ali:        And I think going through a life-changing event in a forgotten temple is something that is going to address those things directly, instead of being like... here's a cool [unintelligible]
Keith:        But I guess my feeling is, through the luck of the cards, the game is —
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Even trying to hand, uh, trying to hand Po Lar his resolution.
Ali:        Sure. But just, we've been using they/them for Po Lar, and I just want to —
Keith:        Oh, sorry, you're right, you're right.
Ali:        Established that. I think Burt is —
Keith:        We're trying to hand Po Lar their resolution — it is just a sort of weird, I — just a cynical coincidence of like, we're trying to work through something for them, and instead we're, we're just being handed all of the best black cards to, to make —
Ali:        Sure.
Keith:        To make Po Lar happy.
Ali:        Well, I mean... you know. And —
Keith:        I think we haven't had a red, a high-red yet, right?
Ali:        [laughing] You know, I, it's going to, you know, maybe that's going to come to Po Lar in the second half of this game, right? Because the cards are the cards, and once the cards are played, they're played.
Dre:        Mmm. Yeah.
Keith:        Yeah.
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        We do have a red king up there.
Ali:        Yeah, yeah.
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        There's probably one in the deck, too.
Keith:        Okay. I have a pitch for something life-changing.
Ali:        Again, it does not have to be... [laughing] it just has to be a fortunate event.
Keith:        Okay. All right, so — but, but, but — okay.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        But what is fortunate for the man who has everything but positive relationships?
2:04:08.2        
Ali:        Well, there are also other aspects of Po Lar's life that we could, you know, bring up here.
Keith:        It's just hard to come up, I'm just coming, I'm just drawing a blank for them. Maybe, okay — can we get a messenger here?
Dre:        Okay.
Ali:        To a forgotten temple? I mean, like — [laughing] that has to be like a divine message, right?
Keith:        That's why I'm asking —
Ali:        This isn't going to be like a postman.
Dre:        Yeah —
Keith:        I meant like a rider.
Dre:        A dream messenger.
Keith:        A rider from town, an adventurer...
Ali:        I...
Dre:        Uh... what if someone possesses the frog to talk to us, that would be a messenger?
Ali:        Oh, okay.
Keith:        The frog already talked to us, I thought.
Ali:        Well yeah, it talks, but —
Keith:        You mean like a, a, a, like a phone call.
Dre:        Uh-huh.
Ali:        Okay.
Keith:        Croak — call frog — Frone call?
Ali:        Yeah, it can be like a — it doesn't have to be physically somebody from town is coming to the cave to give us a message, because I feel like that's outside of what we've established.
Keith:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2:05:06.7        
Ali:        But we could do the like, someone from the adventurer's guild, you know, does a, a communication ritual or something, and we hear, you know, there are other ways to get there that's not — anyway, what's this message?
Keith:        Slight detour —
Ali:        Okay... [laughing]
Dre:        Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Keith:        We're working towards, this is the, like, you know, [unintelligible] courtroom drama, and someone's like, “why is,” you know, “objection! What does this have to — relevance!” And they're like, “I'm getting there, judge!” And they're like, “okay, but be careful.”
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        That's where I'm at.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay.
Keith:        Do, do we want to decide that the, there, the assassin is external, right now?
Ali:        Oh, do we want to make the decision —
Keith:        Sorry, is not Pascal, I mean.
Dre:        Oh.
Ali:        Okay, okay. Uh... we're eventually going to have to make a decision about Pascal here, and if you have a better idea...
Keith:        I, I feel — I... and correct me if I'm wrong, it felt like we were leading away from Pascal as the real assassin. But I may have been misreading that.
Ali:        I think we are continually, every like, thing that we subscribe to Pascal, at this point, we have, we have I think taken the care to make it possibly double-sided.
Keith:        You're right. Yes, you're right.
Ali:        But, you know, flip the coin, have it fall on the ground. We're going to have —
Keith:        How about this. This is a rarity at Friends at the Table, but I think we should do a 3-2-1, assassin, not assassin.
Ali:        Oh, just make the decision?
Dre:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keith:        Yeah. And we don't have to go, we don't have to go with, like, the majority —
Dre:        Wait, but then why are we doing it?
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Just to see, I just want to see where our hearts are.
Dre:        Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, okay.
Ali:        Okay, if we're going to do it like that, then, I feel like my heart is in the cards and I was waiting for like an opportunity for us to draw a card, and then it would be —
Keith:        Okay, that's fair.
Ali:        Fortunate event, unfortunate event, and we would use Pascal in that way, which it sounds like you're trying to do, with this king.
Keith:        Right. Well here, I — I will just remove, I'll remove the — I'll get to it.
Ali:        [laughing] this is —
Keith:        I'm thinking that the fortunate event may be that Burt is doing a full sort of soft-coup, and that, that our position at the head of the Friends of Po Lar is being directly challenged, and that that is a fortunate event because the Friends of Po Lar is actually bad for us.
Ali:        Oh, you're thinking really outside of the box here.
Dre:        Oh...
Keith:        Yeah, so the thing, the second, the addendum to that is that, there was, there was an assassin, and it was being orchestrated by Burt or Burt's faction, and that either we're getting a message from the clan, the guild, being like, “you're out,” or we're meeting, before we head into the temple, Burt's assassin, for real, and then that's what we're dealing with.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        That is, that is what this card was saying to me, is that —
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        If something was really positive, it would have to really be positive, and the really positive thing would be to remove part of what is causing —
Ali:        The threat of the bounty
Keith:        You know, their cynicism and sort of listless, uh, I'm blanking on the word, anti-socialism. But not socialism. Anti-social personality.
Ali:        Yeah. You're saying the fortunate events, and the gaining something life-changing, is the truth that Po Lar has been right this whole time to be suspicious — that's — no! [laughing] because like, it's an extremely...
Keith:        No, no. Okay, well I guess, that is one way to frame it.
Ali:        Sure.
Keith:        But another way to frame it is that, that there's something in your life that is such a part of your life that you won't change it yourself, and that the, that fate has had the good graces to end it for you.
Dre:        Mmm.
Keith:        So that you don't have to... you know what I mean?
Ali:        I, I get what you're saying, I just feel like it's a very, you're really twisting it.
Dre:        Okay, but what about this?
Ali:        Because like, in the — [laughing]
Keith:        I don't think I'm really twisting it.
Dre:        Because, because if Pascal is the assassin, once we lose, like what Keith was saying, once we lose being the owners of the friends of Po Lar, the assassination attempt gets called off, and so now we can be the true friends that we'll always been destined to be.
Ali:        What?! [laughing]
Keith:        I want to, I want to challenge this idea that, uh, that... that Pascal was, that being right — not Pascal, Jesus, I keep doing that. That Po Lar being right to be suspicious was a bad thing, because... you know, they're kind of an asshole —
Ali:        I just —
Keith:        And they surrounded themselves with asshole cops.
2:10:29.4        
Ali:        Okay. I — okay. We're — okay. This is... [laughing]
Dre:        This is escalating quickly.
Ali:        These are a lot of [unintelligible] you really — because I don't know that like, just because you're in the adventurer's guild means that —
Dre:        Wait, but you're the one that made him an asshole, because you're the one that's like, “oh, of course we're the mayor.”
Ali:        Right!
Keith:        Yeah, yeah! I made them an asshole. That's why I'm like — yeah, of course we made them an asshole.
Ali:        So, beyond that, because I don't 100 percent agree with your characterization of Po Lar in this moment. But, we can work through that. I feel like, in a story of an adventurer in like a story that's being retold, the like, act of like, really, like knowing that everybody around you is betraying you is a tragedy. And that can be turned around into something positive, but I don't feel like we can say, like, the life-changing event that was very fortunate for us was the truth of this.
Dre:        That's fair.
Ali:        Do you know what I mean?
2:11:23.6        I don't want to veto this outright, but like, just in terms of like, how stories work —
Keith:        Counterpoint, counterpoint on how stories work, I feel like...
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Jesus.
Keith:        Hey, look — I, I, I feel like, uh...
Dre:        That's a very Po Lar assertion.
Ali:        [laughing] Yeah.
Keith:        Hey, [unintelligible] words!
Dre:        [laughing]
Keith:        Hold on, those were Ali's words, Ali said that!
2:11:53.2        
Ali:        Just like, also just like, because Po Lar would be upset by that. I don't think it's like this immediate, I think, breath of —
Keith:        But it doesn't say, the prompt isn't, makes Po Lar immediately happy.
Ali:        No, okay, sure.
Keith:        It says it's a fortunate event.
Ali:        Okay, sure.
Dre:        I think we need to get off the [unintelligible]
Ali:        Losing all of their friends at this foundation that they built up is unfortunate, in my eyes, like, I'm sorry. [laughing]
Keith:        I, uh, I don't know. I think, uh...
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        I actually felt that my suggestion was not only how, how stories work, but that it was, if anything, cliché. A cliché.
Keith:        Sure. [laughing] I need to — I'm just imagine — in my head, of reading a book, I would be like, “wow, this is really sad.”
2:12:51.5        
Keith:        It can, it can be both.
Ali:        I know, I know that it can be both, and I don't want to... I feel like we can find a middle ground here. But I'm just saying, it doesn't seem very fortunate... [laughing]. But we can get there. We've gotten there with acts 1 through 4. We certainly... is this the truth of Po Lar's life, that they do need to shed themselves of the responsibility of... the adventurer's guild?
Dre:        Uh...
Ali:        And Burt, and the whole thing? Is this... [laughing]
Keith:        I can't say. I can only suggest.
Ali:        Sure. Sure sure sure. Dre, where are you on this? Because I feel like you have a foot in each bucket here.
Dre:        I don't know.
Keith:        Yeah, Dre.
Dre:        I don't know!
Keith:        Which one of us is your friend?
Ali:        [cackling]
Dre:        [uproarious laughing]
Keith:        [laughing] I'm kidding, I don't care. [laughing]
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        But...
Ali:        [laughing] Folks at home who are just joining us, that is my radiator, don't worry about it.
Keith:        That's the frog.
Ali:        Uh-huh. [pause]
Dre:        [sighs] I think... of the twisted webs that we have weaved so far...
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        I think I lean towards... the idea of Po Lar losing the, the adventurer's guild.
Ali:        Okay.
Keith:        I actually don't like it anymore. I'm sorry for being an asshole. I haven't been on a podcast in a few weeks, so I have 3 podcasts in me today.
Ali:        [laughing] Oh, sure, okay.
Dre:        You've got some goofs to work through.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        Okay. Okay. So, okay. Okay. So, Po Lar... uh... [laughing] Po Lar receives a message... Po Lar receives a message from their home. From, I guess, someone from the adventurer's guild? Or was this from Burt?
2:15:27.5        
Keith:        Yeah. Well, uh... it was, we had, I think we had three options on the table from different people. I don't remember what was what. But one of them, I had like, a rider from the town shows up.
Ali:        Okay.
Keith:        Dre suggested phone call, psychic phone call through the magic frog.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        And I had also thrown in, uh, instead of a call, Burt was the person who hired the assassin, and the assassin is like, waiting at the temple, and we deal with that. That's how we find out, from the assassin.
Ali:        Okay.
Keith:        And then we were basically sent here by Burt. There was no assassin in the city. We were meant to leave.
Ali:        Okay. Yeah. Uh...
Keith:        But I don't know, I don't know what, I don't know what we want to do. Because we can, that would then solve, that would solve the Pascal thing.
Ali:        Oh, sure sure sure.
Keith:        But we maybe don't want to do that now.
Ali:        Well, I, if we're saying that Burt is the person who hired the assassination, we can make a decision about the assassin now. There's not going to be any mystery about that anymore.
2:16:40.1        
Keith:        No. Yeah, no, no, no, that's what I mean. If we did that, it would be solving it. But we don't have to do that, and that would not solve it yet.
Ali:        Okay. But we're making the decision, we've made the decision to do that. So Pascal, yes or no?
Dre:        As the assassin?
Ali:        Yeah.
Dre:        Yes.
Ali:        Okay.
Keith:        Pascal is the assassin?
Ali:        Okay. Pascal to confronts Po Lar in the... forget temple... to aassassinate them. In the conflict —
Dre:        Damn...
Ali:        Pascal reveals that they were hired by Burt to... in order to remove Po Lar from the head of the adventurer's guild.
Keith:        Remove your head to remove you as the head.
Ali:        [laughing] uh... do we defeat Pascal here? Do we become an understanding with Pascal? Is that why it's fortunate, because it's — you know...
Keith:        We became friends.
Dre:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keith:        I can't — I can't kill you, you made friends with that frog. I love frogs.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay, okay.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        Saved me from that dragon, that was real.
2:18:06.2        
Ali:        Po Lar is relieved to be unburdened by the stress and responsibility of the adventurer's guild, and in their... uh... how do you describe knightly, what would be a thing a knight would be doing here?
Keith:        Wait, sorry, I —
Ali:        What is like a good attribute that someone would have that would make them bring down their arms against their assassin to, to create a, a bond?
2:18:43.4        
Keith:        … honor.
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Mmm.
Ali:        In their honor —
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        Their sense of honor keeps them from killing Pascal, if Burt is the true villain.
Keith:        You, you know what scene — I've been replaying Yakuza Zero.
Ali:        Fantastic.
Keith:        Because I played, I played Judgment with Isaac, and he really loved Judgment, which makes sense, because Judgment ruled. It was so good. If anyone hasn't played Judgment, Judgment ruled, it was so good. Uh, it's the best Yakuza game, I think. Uh, maybe definitively.
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, for sure.
Keith:        Uh, uh, and I didn't really want to play Judgment 2 yet, kind of because I heard that it wasn't great. So I was like, “let's play Yakuza Zero instead.” And there's this seen, spoilers for Yakuza Zero, for about halfway through, a little more than halfway through — there's this wild scene where [Imajima] shows up, uh, to the, uh, the he [Nyoko] consortium, I think is what they're called. Uh, and that guy was like, “hey, that girl, I took her, uh, and she's safe, don't worry. Imajima's like, “I don't trust you,” and he takes out his sword, takes out his gun and gives it to Imajima, and is like, “if you don't trust me, then shoot me. Kill me —“ literally, kill me. It's wild.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        And so, that's what I'm, I'm stealing that.
Ali:        Oh, you're picturing this, for this confrontation between Pascal and —
Keith:        Yeah, Pascal is like, “if you don't believe me, then... kill me.”
2:20:24.0        
Ali:        Oh, sure. Then Po Lar in this moment is like, wow, Burt, fuck Burt.
Keith:        Fuck Burt.
Dre:        Mm-hm. Fuck Burt —
Keith:        That's what Burt is short for, it's short for Fuckburt.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay, so that is act 5. Confronted in the temple by our assassin, we learn Burt's true nature, and we feel unburdened by the stress of, of distrust that we've had for Burt this whole time.
Keith:        Yeah. Or for Pascal.
Ali:        And Pascal. Well, Burt more.
Keith:        Oh, okay, then both. Burt more. Yeah, Burt more.
Ali:        Like, Burt we have this history with. Burt was our number two.
Keith:        Yeah. Burt was your number two.
Ali:        Okay. [laughing]
Keith:        We don't need a number two anymore.
Ali:        Okay. We have an active 4.
Keith:        We don't need a number two, we have an active 4.
2:21:19.2        
Ali:        We're going to be drawing until we find a 9 in here. Jack... that's not it. Oh, that's — wrong one.
Keith:        Oh, — is that another king?
Ali:        No, the king is what we just played.
Dre:        Oh, okay.
Keith:        Oh, okay, it's stuck for me on top of the —
Ali:        Yeah, my bad.
Keith:        Okay.
Ali:        Uh... 9, 9 and 4.
Dre:        Nice.
Ali:        A pair of red and black cards depict a fortunate event for one party and a tragic event for another.
Keith:        High-9.
Ali:        High-9.
Keith:        Oh, no... a bounty is put on you.
Ali:        We are so — I'm like, this close to erasing that chart.
Keith:        [laughing]
Dre:        Aw. Okay — well...
Ali:        Our story has blossomed beyond these prompts, I think.
Keith:        Yeah, no, it's true. But it's funny.
Ali:        It's, it's great to have training wheels. I mean, if anybody has a really good idea for having a second bounty putting on us, I'm not going to veto us.
2:22:20.2        
Keith:        This is a metaphorical bounty —
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Put on us by, by the malevolent deity. Maybe this is the entrance of the malevolent deity — bad for us, good for the deity.
Ali:        Okay. Okay, yeah.
Keith:        Uh...
Ali:        That was another red 9 and a black 4, the way that we started.
Keith:        Yeah, it was.
Dre:        Oh yeah.
Keith:        Remember those days?
2:22:48.9        
Ali:        [laughing] Plus black 4... act 6. Okay. So —
Keith:        Ali, have you started Judgment 2?
Ali:        I haven't even finished Judgment 1.
Keith:        Wow, you should finish that.
Ali:        I don't know if I should.
Keith:        Did you fall off of it, or... have you just been playing it recently?
Ali:        I did. No, no, no, no, I was playing it when it came out, and then, just fell off of it because of life stuff.
Keith:        It gets, it gets really good.
Ali:        But also because like, no, because I kept — I'm still in the part of the beginning — and we've spoken about this, but I'm still in the beginning of the game, where it's like, way too gimmicky. And like —
Keith:        Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ali:        You do the thing where you have the drone, and there's the cat mewling, because you can find the cat in the scene, but then you're like, “I'm going to spend 20 minutes looking for this cat,” and then you don't find the cat, and then you're like —
Keith:        That stuff –
Ali:        I'm going to do this other thing —
Keith:        Totally [unintelligible]
Ali:        And then the cat is meowing while are also trying to do this plot thing that you can't fucking do, and I was like, “I'm good.”
Keith:        I'll say, damning with faint — this is, what is it, praising with faint damns, I guess, is what I'll say.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        The cat meowing during picture mode is literally the worst thing about that whole game. There is nothing in that game that is worse than the [meow noise] when you're trying to find like, do like, picture hunt, whatever.
Ali:        Uh-huh. Especially like, just the time that you put into it, and then giving up all of that time, and then being like, okay, now to focus on the game, and still have that happen? I...
Keith:        I cannot be the first person to say praising with faint damn, but I love it and I'm going to —
Ali:        [laughing] I played Final Fantasy XIV for 4 years, instead. And then played a bunch of Resident Evil, is what my game years have been. Anyway. So we're going on this, we... moving deeper into the cave, we encounter... the manevolent — mal — malevolent, deity. Who...
Keith:        We're in the temple? We've gone into the cave, in the temple, then the temple's in the cave, carved out of the cave.
2:24:43.6        
Ali:        Oh, sure sure, okay, okay. So we — [laughing] so now I'm understanding. We went through the waterfall, right?
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        And then we're going through this cave, we meet the frog, we have this confrontation with Pascal within the cave. We go deeper, into the cave, and now find the temple.
Keith:        Yeah. Yeah.
Ali:        Okay. Okay.
Keith:        Like, the, uh... fuck. I'm trying to remember the name of this place, the... Kaelasa Temple, is that what I'm thinking of? I think so. I don't know where is it is. But it rules.
Ali:        Uh... do we, we encounter this deity straight out? Or is it... what's the situation here? Ghost situation? Does the deity secretly see us moving within this cave, and they're like, target on your back? Metaphorical bounty, get out of my temple. Or is it like a —
Keith:        [mock yelling] Get out of my cave!
Ali:        Yeah, or is it, you know, you walk into the temple, and it's like, woosh, swishing wind, and you're like, “get out...” on behalf of the souls that live in here I'm going to eat your soul...
Dre:        I like that voice you did.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        I will say, not the scariest malevolent spirit —
Dre:        [spirit growls]
Ali:        Well, you know.
Dre:        Hey, no, listen, it's late.
Ali:        It is late. Uh... [laughing]
Keith:        It's not late.
Dre:        It's late.
Ali:        We — I — encounter with the spirit, yes or no? Is this a secret bounty, or is it the — [laughing] are we stricken with fear upon entering this temple?
Keith:        Yeah, strike me with fear.
Ali:        [laughing] okay. Upon... entering the temple, a booming voice... calls... [laughing] for... love
Keith:        I can do it, I can — wait, no, maybe I can't.
Ali:        Yeah, let's see what this booming voice is saying.
Dre:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keith:        Let's see if I can do it, okay. Uh... [unintelligible] remember the number 40, though.
Ali:        Oh, my fucking god.
Dre:        40? Why?
Ali:        This is the, this is the soundboard.
Keith:        Boom! Do you hear it? Is it boomy?
Ali:        It just sounds like you have a mic with a sock on it.
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        How about more... here? Is that boomy?
Dre:        Now it just sounds like when I try to turn the bass all the way up in my 1987 Ford Escort.
Keith:        That's what I did, I boosted at 71 hertz...
Ali:        [laughing] okay.
Keith:        What if I... moved it a little up? Woo...
Ali:        Okay, Keith, what is the warning that we hear, Po Lar, little frog, and Pascal hear upon crossing the threshold into this forgotten temple?
Keith:        Uh...
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        [cackles]
Keith:        Well I'm just thinking, hold on...
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        It's me, the malevolent deity, thinking.
Keith:        Uh... I would say...
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Jesus Christ.
Ali:        This really just sounds like you're talking to me from inside of like, like a, like a cooler.
Keith:        [noises] It sounds like I'm puking into a toilet bowl.
Ali:        Yeah.
Dre:        Uh-huh...
Ali:        This is like, when you do those like, things and it's like, you're listening to the weekend, or like, to an anime song, but it's playing in a party in the next room or whatever. It just sounds like there's distance between us.
Keith:        Well, I am in the next room, I'm a demon in the next room.
Ali:        Sure — [laughing] and what's the demon saying?
Dre:        That's true.
Ali:        Reach inside of yourself and find a warning from a demon in there.
Keith:        Okay. [sputtering and throat-clearing as if preparing for the demon voice]
Ali:         [laughing] [unintelligible]
Keith:        Bleh! Bleh! [gravelly voice] Hold on. I hurt my throat.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        There's no way back, only through! I will eat the souls of two! Gah, ah... And a frog. And... uh... no, this is bad.
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        [gravelly noises] [pause] [normal voice] No, I don't have it tonight.
Ali:        This is fine, no, no, no.
Dre:        I liked — yeah.
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is what we needed, this is, this is —
Keith:        Okay.
Ali:        Can you come back to this room, please?
Keith:        Uh... okay.
Ali:        Please? [laughing]
Keith:        How's that?
Ali:        Better but you're still, like, quiet.
Dre:        There's Keith. You do sound far away.
Ali:        Did you lower your gain while you were doing the boom?
Keith:        Yeah, I had to lower my gain so that I wasn't —
Dre:        40. 40.
Keith:        Thank you for that. 40 was the drive, not the gain.
Ali:        Uh-huh.
Keith:        Okay. All right. We're good, this is how I normally sound, right, that's normal?
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh...
Keith:        Okay. So there's no way, we have to go through, that's what this —
Ali:        There's no way out, only through. Sorry I will eat the souls of two.
Keith:        Yeah. And a frog.
Ali:        Plus a frog. Which is terrifying, you know?
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        Certainly a fortunate event, unfortunate event for us. We're scared — I mean, Po Lar, you know, has the confidence of a rich adventurer who is now unburdened by their old life. But I'm sure the frog is a little, feeling a little scared here. And you know, Pascal is a bounty hunter, but...
Keith:        Okay, I'm the frog now — “I'm shaking in my boots, captain!”
2:31:36.0        
Ali:        [laughing] Yeah, yeah, this is the scene.
Dre:        This is good. This is good. This is good.
Keith:        I'm here. I close my eyes, I see — I have a zero cube score, so I'm not seeing anything, actually, but I can feel the cave, I can [unintelligible] the frog.
Keith:        Did you say you have a zero cube score?
Ali:        Yeah, do you know what — you also have a zero cube score. This is a tweet, I think.
Keith:        What? Oh, the cube score! I remember the cube, can you visualize —
Ali:        Yeah, how many cubes can you think about in your head and rotate them?
Keith:        A cube in your mind.
Ali:        Yeah.
Keith:        And, no, we answered that, no.
Ali:        Are we, is this, is this zero cube score gang on Friends at the Table? Is it the three of us, or is it just me and Keith?
Keith:        Dre, did you say you're a zero cube score, too?
Dre:        What? I don't know what it is!
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Oh, this is very, this is super easy to explain, but very hard to believe. Because, either way, it sucks to learn, I think. And it's like —
Ali:        Well no, Dre, either you — when you close your eyes, if I was like, close your eyes and visualize an apple right now, would you be able to do that?
Dre:        Oh, yes, yes.
Ali:        Okay. But you had a friend who —
Keith:        Like literally, or maybe not literally, but you can see the shape and/or color and size, like you can actually picture something.
Dre:        Yeah, no, we've, we've talked about this before, yes.
Ali:        Yeah. Uh-uh.
Dre:        Yes, I also have a friend who cannot do that, like Keith cannot.
Ali:        Okay. Right, and I also cannot. This is — okay.
Dre:        Oh, wow, okay.
Keith:        It's stupid, every time I think about it — I'm sad now.
Dre:        I'm sorry. It's okay.
Ali:        [laughing] It's fine, you know, we have gains in other ways. We're not unimaginative people, Keith.
Keith:        I'm not.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay. Is there any — act 6, do we have any more fortunes or unfortunes to — this was an easy one, I think, we knocked this one out. The malevolent spirit is here.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        Okay. So now we're looking for a 3, or we're looking for another 9.
Keith:        Yeah, 3 or a 9. Or — there's no more kings, right? That's it for kings.
Ali:        Uh... there might be a red king somewhere in the deck.
Keith:        I think that we've gotten two kings, and there's one on the board, and I think there was a king in our first draw.
Ali:        Oh yeah... okay.
Keith:        8? No? No way.
Ali:        4 also is not going to do it.
Keith:        Oh, your little math, your little math cheat sheet.
Ali:        [laughing] 6 isn't going to do it, 3 isn't going to — oh, was it 10 and 3? 10 and 3.
Keith:        Where's the 3? Oh, I'm looking at YouTube.
Ali:        [laughing].
Keith:        I'm like, that's a 4, Ali.
Dre:        Ali, what the fuck?
Keith:        Ali, what the fuck?
Ali:        [laughing] Okay. 10 and a 3. Uh... a pair of black and red cards depicts a fortunate event for one party and a tragic event for another.
Dre:        Well, this is how we get one over on the malevolent deity?
Keith:        Ooh, or is this how we sink deeper towards the grasp of the malevolent deity?
Ali:        Yeah, who's, who's the fortune, who is the unfortunate person, who's the fortunate person. These are decisions — [laughing] we've got to make. I've, I've been very anti-, uh, chart, but the chart does say, discover a hidden secret, just to have that on your mind —
Keith:        No.
Dre:        No.
Keith:        No chart.
Dre:        Yeah, no. Fuck that chart.
Ali:        [laughing] it's just we had a lot of —
Dre:        We should fucking delete that chart.
Keith:        Yeah, I hate that chart.
Ali:        [laughing] You know, I was thinking about it. I — remember when I said that I was thinking about it?
Dre:        Yeah, that's why I said it.
Keith:        Yeah, and back then I didn't agree.
Dre:        That's why I said it.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay. Black 10 plus a red 3, act 7. We're in this cave —
Keith:        For me, that's the question is, is this good for us and bad for the spirit? Or reverse? Or neither?
Ali:        This is really, you know, this is the wheelhouse that we're in here now, because now we have direct spirit interaction.
Keith:        Oh, you're saying that, you're saying that Po Lar's in a wheelhouse now.
Ali:        No, it's our wheelhouse. It's Po Lar's hidden temple. It's the deity's hidden temple, Po Lar's in the temple.
Keith:        We found a secret wheelhouse hidden in the temple.
Dre:        I think [unintelligible] [
Keith:        Okay, how's that? [testing microphone]
Ali:        You're fine.
Keith:        It's good.
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keith:        What if... we said this malevolent spirit was like a, the revenant of like a priest or something?
Ali:        Uh-huh.
Dre:        Right.
Keith:        What if, he worshipped a god, but now, he is the god.
Ali:        Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Dre:        Well, okay —
Keith:        Corrupted and twisted, by his own beliefs.
Dre:        Sure. Uh, I was going to say, what if the good essence of the priest lives on in the frog?
Keith:        Wow. Yeah, that rules.
Dre:        Thanks, Keith.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay, so — okay, sure. Okay.
Keith:        Does the frog know?
Ali:        Yeah, what's the, what's the — let's zoom in on this moment here.
Keith:        I'll tell you my gut feeling, is that the frog didn't know, but then I — because I wasn't considering it, but maybe the frog does know.
Dre:        Mmm.
Ali:         Well, I feel — you know —
Dre:        Frog knows but can't communicate it?
Ali:        Would it be a fortunate event for the frog to learn this truth about themselves?
Keith:        It's taboo, it's the game taboo. Is that the game, was that what the game taboo is?
Ali:        I don't know what you're talking about.
Keith:        I think there's a board game called taboo —
Dre:        There is.
Keith:        Where you try to make someone guess something, but like, you can't say, like a list of words you can't say.
Ali:        Oh, sure sure sure.
Dre:        I think that's true, I think that's true, yeah.
Ali:        Okay. So the frog, the frog learns the truth about the nature of their spirit. How? [laughing]
Dre:        Hm.
Keith:        They — hm. My cat is screaming.
Ali:        From within the depths of the cave, the frog —
Keith:        No, from my office.
Ali:         [laughing] The frog hears a voice — [snorts laughing]
Dre:        The frog ribbits, but then the ribbit echoes throughout the cave and resolves as a voice.
Ali:        Oh, so the frog, the frog hears their own voice —
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        Speaking to them, like, through the, through the —
Keith:        Through the echoes of their croak.
Ali:        The echoes of their croak. Okay. The frog... begins to hear voices. Okay. A voice. Echoing back —
Keith:        [to cat] What is it?
Ali:        From — created from their own ribbits slash frog noises.
Keith:        Sometimes my cat will find himself alone in a room and decide to just scream and cry, like —
Ali:        Yeah, doesn't want to be alone.
Keith:        Not a normal cat meow, but like a yowl, like a sad bellow.
Ali:        My cat does that. Uh... it's tough to be alone when you're a little cat. The voice —
Keith:        Wow, I'm putting that on a pillow.
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        It's true! [laughing] The voice reveals the truth of the souls of the frog's soul — wait — to them. Revealing that the frog is the... the... goodness? We're talking about a split soul situation here?
Dre:        Yeah, the, the positive essence.
Ali:        The positive essence.
Dre:        The benevolent essence?
Ali:        [laughing] essence of the malevolent deity —
Keith:        Counterspirit.
Ali:        They used to be one soul. One soul. And now... they are two. Good and evil. Wow.
Keith:        Wow.
Ali:        Who is this unfortunate for? Or, I mean, you know, this feels like it's fortunate and unfortunate for the frog all at once.
Keith:        Very mixed.
Dre:        Yeah, yeah.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        I'll say, long view, it's fortunate. It's good to know who you really are, even if it's tough.
Ali:        Yeah, we're really setting up a story here where it's fortunate to learn about the nature of your true self.
Dre:        Yeah, to learn the hard truths.
Ali:        And the nature of — of those around you. But I feel like it's also really unfortunate to be like, damn, my soul's in half.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        And I'm stuck in the half that has to eat flies.
Keith:        [laughing] Or, hey, maybe he's a little freak, and he's stuck in the half that gets to eat flies.
Ali:        Right, exactly. I would, I would rather be, you know, hopping around having a life of my own instead of being this, this evil... mean... how do you spell essence?
Keith:        ESSENCE.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        Okay. [laughing] Yeah, I mean, that's a tough day. That's a tough day is what that is.
Dre:        Yeah. Yeah.
Ali:        Damn, soul spit in half. Okay. We have an active 4 and we have an active 2.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        Let's draw these cards.
Dre:        So we need a 9 or a —
Ali:        Jack.
Dre:        Jack? Yeah, okay.
2:41:15.8        
Ali:        10 isn't going to do it.
Dre:        Close.
Keith:        Wow, right in the middle. Threaded the needle.
Ali:        5 isn't going to do it — [laughing] 6 isn't going to do it. 9?
Keith:        9's going to do it.
Dre:        There it is.
Ali:        9 and a — 9 and a 4.
Keith:        And that's honestly the best-case scenario, too.
Ali:        9 and a 4. Okay, so this is another pair of black and red cards, fortunate for one and tragic for another. So we are still locked in, you know, some sort of confrontation with the spirits here.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        We have not defeated or been defeated my the malevolent deity.
Dre:        What do we do to exorcise the malevolent spirit and restore —
Keith:        [making an “exercise” pun] Treadmill.
Dre:        The frog as, as the master of this temple?
Ali:        [sighs] I don't want to be this person again, but that feels like all positive. That feels like something we should do if we get a good king, or —
Dre:        Mmm, that's fair, that's fair.
Keith:        Uh...
Ali:        This is still, but, you know. I can, we can complicate it.
Keith:        Wait, what was the one that wasn't exorcise the malevolent spirit?
Ali:        What do you mean?
Keith:        Of the two things that you put forward, Dre?
Dre:        I'm sorry?
Keith:        Did you put, did you say something, and also exorcise the malevolent spirit?
Ali:        I think it was reconnect the souls.
Dre:        Yeah, to —
Keith:        Got it, okay.
Dre:        Either reconnect the souls, or like, elevate the frog soul and banishing the bad soul.
Keith:        Right.
Ali:        Mmm.
Keith:        What if...
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Both souls have to be reconnected inside of a person, which is either us or Pascal?
Dre:        So we die, or Pascal dies?
Keith:        Well, I don't know —
Ali:        It can just be a two-soul situation?
Dre:        Yeah.
Ali:        But then, you know, but then it's — this is getting complicated here. [laughing]
Keith:        Look, I like you, frog, but I don't really like you like that.
Ali:        Yeah, you don't have to be, our souls don't have to be mingling inside of me here.
Keith:        I need my space.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Separate head rooms.
Ali:        This is, you know, this is, this is — I don't want to take the threat of the malevolent spirit off of the table here, because I don't know that we've reached our final act. But maybe we have. I don't know how the cards are going to go.
Keith:        Uh... what if we, uh, what if we give ourselves a... uh, what if we give, what if we have a mind games room in this place, that is designed to —
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        Sow distrust. And we already have trust issues.
Ali:        Mm-hm. Oh, okay.
Keith:        And we've only barely, uh... we've only barely allied ourselves with the ex-assassin Pascal. What would be something negative, I think, that would be red.
Ali:        I'm liking this. I feel like this is, and we can combine these plans, right? Which is, it is our intent to rejoin the souls between the deity and this frog, right? To create this rejoining.
Keith:        It's certainly my intent.
Ali:        [laughing] But in, in order to do that, we need to go through this trial, this trust trial, in this temple.
Keith:        Yeah, totally, yeah.
Ali:        And we're, you know, we're here, we've recently had a crisis of trust. We're here with a bounty hunter, who was sent here to kill us. And on top of this, we've got this frog who's like... “welcome, traveler, you're the number one guy, I'm going to be your familiar,” and then you get into this damn temple and this frog is like, yeah, I'm half of an evil guy. What's more distrustworthy than that? [laughing]
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        I thought you were a familiar?
Keith:        Yeah, turns out you were unfamiliar.
Dre:        Mmm.
Ali:        You know?
Keith:        I've got to turn on this light, it's dark in here.
Ali:        Do we feel good about this? What's the trust thing, though?
Keith:        Do either of you have a room that's like, hard to light?
Ali:        Sort of. I have a room that I don't like the light that's in there, so I usually keep it dark.
Keith:        Just the color temperature of it, or what?
Ali:        Yeah. I had to get the lightbulb changed, and it changed from a warm one to like a really bright one.
Keith:        Oh, you like a — you like a, you like a white, like a white, white light.
Ali:        I don't. I don't.
Keith:        Oh.
Ali:        I'm saying that I used to have a warm light, and then the super in my building was just like, here's a lightbulb I've had lying around. And it was like a very bright white that ruined my living room, basically.
Dre:        Okay.
Ali:        It didn't ruin it. I'm being dramatic. But I don't turn the light on anymore.
Keith:        Yeah. Yeah. One of the things that I happened when I moved into this apartment, last spring, is, uh, like, all of the lights were shitty incandescent bulbs, that were, you know, uh... they just weren't bright enough to light any of the apartment, so I had to spend some stupid amount of money on a bunch of brighter LED bulbs. But the bright side — eh? [recognizing pun] — the bright side was that, uh, I got to make them all the same, or pretty much the same, color temperature. Uh... but my office is just like, a weird shape, and it's hard to get a light that's not too bright locally, that isn't also too dark for the room.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        I have four light sources in this room, and it just barely is enough, and it's very annoying.
Ali:        Uh... okay.
Keith:        That was a fun detour, right?
Ali:        [laughing] I would love to be like, 40 percent more focused so we could not be streaming until midnight.
Dre:        Mmm. Yeah.
Keith:        [whispering] 40 percent...
Ali:        Yeah.
Dre:        Okay, I can do that.
Ali:        Yeah, I would love for that.
2:47:20.4        Uh... the party resolves to rejoin the soul of the frog and the spirit, restoring the balances of the souls. Traveling deeper into the temple, they encounter a room of trust... [laughing] a, a, a, a... uh, a challenge of trust. Which is very difficult to overcome
Keith:        What's the game?
Ali:        What is the game? What's the challenge?
Keith:        There's an easy one to do.
Ali:        Mm-hm?
Keith:        We could just steal the like, what is it, is it called the prisoner's dilemma?
Ali:        I don't know what that is.
Keith:        This is a... well-known thing where it's like, if you... you know, if you rat on your friend, and they rat on you, then you both get time. If you rat on them, they don't rat on you, you get off Scott-free. If neither of you rats on each other, then you go free, but if you both — how does it go? Basically, it makes it always beneficial to be the most selfish.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        By ratting on your friend.
Ali:        Oh, because you can't, you cannot guarantee that the person is not —
Keith:        Right, yes.
Ali:        Rat on you, so you should rat on them, so you know whatever happens — yeah.
Keith:        I, yeah, I just don't remember how the actual quantities are. But it's basically to guide you into getting the worst amount of time, by making you greedy and selfish. I think that that is called the prisoner's dilemma. But it's definitely a real thing. So that's the easy one.
Dre:        Mmm, yes.
Keith:        I don't know if anyone has any —
Ali:        Right, but how does that become like a temple challenge? Is it like, you can only go through the, you can only go through the, the, there's like a corridor that's really thin, and you can only go through one at a time?
Keith:        Yeah, or you, or you get, or you get separated into two rooms, and then ordered to escape the room, you either have to press a button that like, dooms the other one, or trust that the other one won't do it, so that you also don't do it, so that you can both get through.
Ali:        Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keith:        You know what I mean?
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, we're getting back to Nathan Drake here. [laughing] Also, this would be three rooms, because, you know, the frog is here. And who knows the nature of this frog? Okay, so the party —
Keith:        Only the frog.
Ali:        Huh?
Keith:        Only the frog knows.
Ali:        Right. The party is separated into three rooms. Rooms. Where... they are asked to... either save themselves or take the risk that the party will all be loyal to each other. I would say, okay, so unfortunate event here is... both the anxiety of this test, but also not being able to... do the rejoining yet. Whereas the fortunate event here is that the party, everybody does the third option, everyone's like, “it's tough for me to believe this, but I'm going to pick the one that everybody gets through.” And they all —
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        They get to the other side and they're like, “damn, thanks, y'all.”
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        Okay. [laughing] Okay. Uh... when the entire party makes it to the other side unscathed —
Keith:        Hey, you know what's a good idea? Not for this, but for something else, but I'm just saying it out loud to keep it in there — a rigged prisoner's dilemma, where no matter what you pick, it makes it seems like the other person dooms you.
Dre:        Mmm.
Ali:        [laughing] Yeah, coming to an escape room near you. Uh... there's a newfound loyalty amongst the three in discovering they all —
Keith:        [playing on camaraderie] Camfrogerie.
Ali:        [laughing] In the interest... of the group. And whether that was like, “oh, leave this temple and I'll give you a gem, but then I'm going to kill your friends,” or whatever the fuck. You can imagine your own —
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        You at home [laughing] can imagine your own. [laughing]
Keith:        Think, to find out what happens.
Ali:        [snorts laughing] Okay. So here we are. We have two active 3s, one active 2. We really need some face cards here, or else we're going to be epilogue time.
Dre:        Uh-huh.
Ali:        Which, now I feel bad about saying that wasn't going to be the final act, so the epilogue, we'll say — or the cards we'll say. 5 isn't going to do it. 2 is not going to do it. Ace... not going to do it. We need a queen.
2:52:24.2        That's the fucked up thing about this, is that Queens can only go with aces, so you need two, like, big-point cards. The queen is very hard.
Dre:        Uh-huh.
Keith:        I think, uh, yeah, this should be — what is it, is it blackjack where an ace, like, is a 10 or a 1?
Ali:        Mmm...
Dre:        Yeah. Yeah.
Ali:        7 is not it.
Dre:        Well, and it's 11 or a 1.
Keith:        11 or 1, yeah.
Ali:        7 is not it. Jack... jack and a 2.
Keith:        Jack and a 2.
Ali:        Jack and a 2. And here we are once again, fortunate event, tragic event for another. Are we running out of tragedies? I don't feel like we're running out of tragedies, but we've really got to... what's happening in this town here?
Keith:        A natural disaster... oh, this is, I mean, this is, this is a classic. Mid, mid-temple heist earthquake.
Dre:        Oh yeah, totally. It's collapsing? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ali:        Ooh.
Keith:        Yeah. Yeah.
Ali:        Okay. Wow... this is, this is a really trying time.
Keith:        And by, and by natural disaster, who knows, is this actually a malevolent deity disaster. But the effect is the same, it's an earthquake shaking the...
Ali:        Okay. An earthquake shakes the... do we get separated? Is it just trying? Does somebody get hurt?
Keith:        Does somebody get lost in the rubble?
Ali:        Does somebody get lost in the rubble?
Dre:         Hm... [pause]
2:53:58.3        
Ali:        Okay. Does, does Po Lar get separated from Pascal and the frog? Does the frog get separated... well, I don't want to — okay. I don't want to take the frog off of the table, because we're stepping towards the finale of a soul rejoining.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        I don't, I don't want us to have to like, draw a card to get the frog back, and then draw a card to do the rejoining, you know what I mean?
Dre:        Fair. Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah.
Ali:        But... Po Lar being on their own is interesting, because that's sort of the tragedy of Po Lar's life: do I want to be alone, do I want Pascal and the frog back?
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        Yadda-yadda-yadda [laughing] Or is it, or is it like, you know, Pascal gets lost, and then Po Lar and the frog need to go on to perform their soul-y, their profound duty here — but then it's like, we, we left Pascal behind?
Keith:        Or is this, is this a case where it's Po Lar that gets stuck, and Pascal needs to like, repay the original... saving?
Ali:        [gasps] Okay.
Keith:        It's now Pascal that needs to save Po Lar.
Dre:        Yeah, I like that.
Ali:        Okay... uh, causing Po Lar to get separated from... uh... Pascal and the frog, and little frog. Uh... Pascal... uh, instead of traveling on... uh, takes the time to reunite and save Po Lar. Repaying Po Lar's earlier kindness with the large lizard slash fantasy dragon — [laughing] slash fantasy dragon slash three-story beast. That's, I mean, that's, that's a bad event because it's, you know, Po Lar's probably a little hurt here. An earthquake isn't very good, you know, your pathway isn't too clear anymore.
2:56:16.5        
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        But then, you know, it's, it's, it's a great event, because, you know, Pascal really steps up to the plate here.
Keith:        Hits a home run.
Ali:        Yeah, hits a home run. [laughing] Okay. Two active 3s, we need a 10 here. I really hope that we get the soul rejoined. I want that for him.
Keith:        There's definitely more 10s.
Ali:        Why isn't a card coming... oh, is there no more cards? [gasps]
Dre:        Uh-oh.
Keith:        Wow.
Ali:        There's no more cards.
Keith:        There's not definitely more 10s.
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        [laughing] There's no more 10s, there's no more nothing. What? Dang. Okay. Uh... wow.
Keith:        I see cards in the pile.
Ali:        That's weird — but it like — when I try to draw one, see how, when I, I guess — you might have to watch on YouTube, or you can reach towards the deck in roll20 yourself. But when you hover over the card... [laughing] you're just looking through... these are all the pairs that we made.
Dre:        Oh, okay.
Keith:        Oh, you've been putting the discarded pairs in there.
Ali:        Bottom is pairs that we made. All of the discards is top
Keith:        Okay. What if I hit, in the corner, draw one card? Error. Yeah, okay.
Ali:        Right, there's no more.
Keith:        Error. I don't like this is — I think roll20 should change this. When you try to draw a card from a deck with no more cards, it goes, “error: trying to draw from a deck with no more cards?” There's a question mark at the end, and I feel like it's accusatory.
Ali:        Uh... I mean... we could just go to epilogue here.
Keith:        We have to.
Ali:        And then I guess the epilogue could be the frog's fate. Or — we could recall —
Keith:        Well, do we feel like there's something that we wanted, that we can't solve in an epilogue? I mean, I guess, the malevolent deity, yeah. I mean, he didn't get a —
Ali:        Well let's, okay, let's look at what the epilogue prompt is here, and then we can sort of decide...
Keith:        Okay.
Ali:        If we, like, just want to recall those cards and draw another like 5 or whatever. Or... okay. Let's, I'm just going to move this for now, [unintelligible] delete it in a second.
2:58:28.1        
Keith:        Oh, okay, so there's rules to the epilogue.
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keith:        When you have no more cards in the pyramid or have run out of legal moves, the game ends. If the pyramid still has cards on it, the total of the number of red cards and black cards — subtract the lower number from the higher number. The table below gives some examples on the type of epilogs you may have. Okay. So then it's like red is a bad epilogue.
Ali:        Right. So, what we, we're looking at here is, a king, a 13 plus a 16 is a 19 red. And then we have... uh... 11 plus 3 is 14 plus 3 is 17. So we would end up a...
Keith:        Wait, isn't this 16 and 16?
Ali:        No, because a jack is... a jack is 11.
Keith:        Oh, right. Sorry, I'm thinking face cards are all 10s, so, sorry.
Ali:        Yeah. Uh... so, yeah, that would be a — [laughing] we would get a black-high with 1. Or, no, 19...
Keith:        Yeah, 19. It's a red 3, right?
Ali:        Yes.
Keith:        Or red... 2. 2.
Ali:        A red 2. You set off on another adventure, this one larger than the last.
Dre:        Y'all. Annie has already drawn Po Lar and Pascal and the frog.
Ali:        [laughing] Of course. I feel like we can make an appropriate epilogue out of this. Like, we do the, we do the thing, and the frog is able to leave the temple with us, and now we're... we have a new adventurer's guild, and it's just the 3 of us. We're ride or die. We don't need people come here for a check, we don't need people buying our tee shirts, we don't need people... yadda-yadda-yadda.
Keith:        This movie gets bad reviews, because —
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Mmm.
Keith:        Not totally all bad. It's divisive. Because I think what this says to me is, they make an extreme point of — it's not about the deity, it's about the friendship.
Ali:        Right.
Keith:        Because we basically have a cut to, that cuts out the implied climax of the move.
Ali:        So, but, but here's the climax of the movie, is Pascal saving us.
Keith:        Yes.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        In that moment, Pascal makes the decision, what's more important here? The, the, the trust that I've gained with this frog and Po Lar, or moving on with this frog, because what's important is the soul and the journey and the yadda-yadda-yadda. But no, Pascal says, the final act of this is going to be this, this act of friendship, this echoing of the rescue that started this.
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        Yes.
3:01:24.1        
Ali:        [laughing] And then in the epilogue, it is — we cut from that to — you know, Pascal, little frog.
Keith:        Two adventurers, three horses, on the back of one is, is Pascal, on the back of one is Po Lar, and on the back of one... is a little frog.
Ali:        Is a little frog.
Dre:        [laughing]
Keith:        [laughing] Hopping along.
Ali:        That was great. I feel like — any other...? I feel like, I feel like that's a perfect cap. We've really —
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        We've really, we've really sowed a story here about like, the trust, the nature of companionship, you know.
Keith:        I think, yeah, I think there was some complex stuff going on, personally.
Ali:        [laughing] This wasn't a story about... glass-blown... adventurers, and... you know, secret rings, and —
Keith:        No.
Ali:        En — enchantments. This was a story about, at the end of the day, who can you, can you open up your heart to somebody, and will they do the same to you? And what we found... [laughing]
Keith:        This is a... yeah.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        I agree.
Ali:        Okay. Any other final words here? Any other final moments that we want to... wow. I'm, I'm loving this for the gang.
Keith:        Yeah. Hey, you said focus 40 percent, and I'm like, “how about 80 percent?”
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Keith turning it on.
Ali:        Uh-huh. I'm glad. I'm glad. We got here.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        And this is a great... a story about trust, at its, at its heart, and I love that for it. So... okay, yeah. This has been, Uncover Your Story by Zuhayri Mohamed. You can find that over at vazsun.itch.io, uh, [spells website]. This was recently in the, I guess it's not available anymore so it might not be worth mentioning, but the Malaysia relief bundle that was going around.
3:03:34.6        If there's anybody in the audience who is like, “I bought that, but haven't looked through the games.” Go play Uncover Your Story, because it was really fun.
Keith:        Yeah, it's good. It's short, good — solo.
Ali:        Yeah, again, this is a solo game, so this is one of those games that you can just sit down and create —
Keith:        Yep. Someone, forever and ever ago, like literally two years ago, emailed about solo games for an old Tips.
Ali:        Uh-huh.
Keith:        Boom. Uncover Your Story. Still listening? Uncover Your Story.
Ali:        We've — we've gotten so many of those questions. It's like, you know, “what's a good —“
3:04:00.9        
Keith:        Oh, really? I just remember the one that I was on from forever ago.
Ali:        Uh-huh. We've done a couple, because I've been looking through games that would be easy to pick up without having a... capital G, GM. So, going through solo games with a crowd has been really fun, and I think that we're going to continue to be doing some of those. But — yeah.
Keith:        Not a lot of solo games though. There's obviously way more group games.
Ali:        Sure — well, yeah.
Keith:        Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's a lot more than I think there are.
Ali:        You know, uh, itch.io is a great place, and...
Keith:        Yeah.
Dre:        Uh-huh.
Ali:        I did want to mention, I... so we played this game, which was... an RPG storytelling game based off of pyramid solitaire. We played, uh... guess who dunnit, which was another story-generating game, based off of playing a game of Guess Who. If you're at home and you're thinking to yourself, “I want to play more storytelling games that are just a different game!” Another game that I've been looking at is... I actually should look this up before I say it. It's Free Space: Nova, by Riley...? question mark. Riley Rethal. And that is a game where, basically, you like assign character attributes onto a bingo board, and then, as you go through the story, try to mark off those — try to create a bingo from those, to, uh... [laughing]
3:05:44.4        Me half-remembering the rules of this game and trying to explain them. Uh, once you hit a bingo you change something significant in the story, you sort of use the bingo board as a, as the, you know, the engine for that, the way that we used solitaire. So if you're looking for a game like the games that we've been playing, that's also one. I actually hope to do this on the Live at some point, but I wanted to mention it since it's been overarcing in our lives.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        And yeah, this was really fun. There was a... [laughing] episode of Sanfielle that dropped tonight. I hope that people who listened to it enjoyed it. I had fun doing it.
Keith:        Oh... which one?
3:06:22.6        
Ali:        Uh... have you listened to any of this arc at all, y'all? Because, uh... Blackwick is, uh, going through it.
Keith:        Uh, I have only seen... uh, people worrying about it in the Discord.
Dre:        [laughing]
Ali:        [laughing] Oh, sure. Sure. Sure.
Keith:        I have not listened to it yet.
Ali:        Yeah, I, there's, there's some stuff happening, and it's getting worse. The...
Keith:        Yeah, I could tell that it was going to be rough, because of how much like, I don't even know what we have to do in planning, that was going on in the Discord, which there's usually zero of. There's usually none at all.
3:06:56.1        
Ali:        Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Keith:        Uh, so, I was like, wow, something fucked-up must've happened.
Ali:        Yeah... yeah. Yeah, we got, we got back, and some things were happening, and now things — like the last, the last like 2, 3 minutes of this episode is a big reveal that is scary and gross.
Keith:        Uh... Dre, did you link fanart for this episode?
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Uh-huh. Yeah.
Keith:        That's already done?
Dre:        Yeah, no, that's Annie. Yeah.
Keith:        [laughing] What the fuck? It's really good. But it's not — we're not even done doing it yet.
Dre:        It's super good.
Keith:        How did you do that?
Ali:        Well, like, you listen, and you draw it as you're listening. Bringing this up on the screen for people —
3:07:31.9        
Keith:        I couldn't draw this in... 30 years. Let alone two hours.
Ali:        [laughing] Shout-out to Annie, slash [@nancynaru] at Twitter.com.
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        But yeah, thank you so much.
Dre:        [laughing] [unintelligible] Annie's Twitter name out loud, I guess that's how you say it.
Keith:        It's great. Oh, you've never said it out loud? I've said it out loud. It's fun.
Dre:        Nancynaru.
Keith:        Nancynaru. Yeah.
Ali:        [laughing] It's pretty good. Uh... speaking of Twitter handles, I have been Alicia Acampora. You can find me over at @ali_west on Twitter. You can find Friends at the Table over at @friends_table on Twitter.com, where you'll get more announcements for livestreams like this, and other things.
3:08:10.7        I've been joined by Keith J. Carberry.
Keith:        Yeah, that's me. Go to my YouTube, please. Please watch Runbutton.
Dre:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        YouTube.com
Keith:        It's really good. I don't know what else to say. I know how many listen to Friends at the Table, and how many people watch Runbutton, so...
Ali:        [laughing] it's different — okay. You know — YouTube.com/runbutton.
Keith:        Hey, just check it out.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        It's good.
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        It's a lot different, I get it. It's a lot different than Friends at the Table, but it's really good.
Ali:        Content [unintelligible] .biz
Keith:        Yeah, that's the Patreon, go there.
Ali:        YouTube.com/runbutton. Check it out. If you haven't checked it out, at least check it out, right?
Dre:        Yeah.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        Like if you haven't, if you've been listening to Keith say that for like 5 years, it's time to at least watch one Run Button video.
3:08:48.8        
Keith:        Yeah, what the fuck?
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        I cannot recommend enough, the recent Metal Gear Solid let'splays we've done.
Ali:        Mmm.
Keith:        I think they're really good. It's like... sometimes, you know, we've been doing them for almost 10 years. This year it will be 10 years... of Run Button.
Ali:        Wow.
Keith:        And sometimes you're like, “am I getting worse at everything that I do?”
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        You ever think — I'm sure everybody's had the experience where you're like... am I just worse now, than I was before? But, you know, Metal Gear Solid is so good that I'm like, oh no, I'm as good or before than I've ever been, at doing this.
Ali:        [laughing]
Keith:        It's really good, watch them both. We did, we just finished — we finished playing 2. Go watch 1, it's better. It's a better game and it's a better let'splay.
Ali:        Okay.
Keith:        But 2 is still really good, both as a game and as a let'splay. And that's like, almost fully released.
3:09:49.4        
Ali:        Yeah, go do that.
Keith:        Yeah.
Ali:        [laughing] I've also been joined by Andrew Lee Swan.
Dre:        Hey.
Ali:        Go watch Run Button.
Dre:        Uh —
Ali:        [laughing]
Dre:        Find me on Twitter at @swandre3000. That's all I got.
Ali:        [laughing] uh...
Keith:        Go, go watch — hey, go watch, fucking, uh, Arctic Alive!
Ali:        Go watch Arctic Alive —
Dre:        Yeah. Yeah!
Ali:        Go do that.
Keith:        Yeah. That's got Ali and Jack on it, so...
3:10:12.7        
Ali:        Yeah. Uh-huh. We had a great time. I had an, I made a reference to that livestream in a recent Sangfielle episode, so go watch that, if you didn't know.
Keith:        People still tweet at me — get ready.
Ali:        Yeah, that's what I said. [laughing]
All:        [laughing]
Ali:        Jack had described a Pikmin, like — they said Sea of Thieves, which is also the thing, but someone holding a map in front of them, like, as if Sea of Thieves. But that's also an Arctic Alive thing, so I said, [Marn] gets ready, and then I — [laughing] quickly brushed off explaining what that was.
Keith:        [laughing]
Ali:        And that's the origin story to that joke. If I didn't cut it — I don't think that I did.
3:10:55.7        
Keith:        It's winter, so it is a good time to watch Arctic Alive, it's very good —
Ali:        It's true!
Keith:        It's a very good winter let'splay.
Ali:        You know, there's supposed to be like a big-boy snowstorm Monday. Maybe that's —
Keith:        Oh, really?
Ali:        I think so.
Keith:        In like, in like our area of the world?
3:11:05.8        
Ali:        I think so, yeah. I don't know if it's going to get up there.
Keith:        The two of us, not —
Ali:        But, I — yeah, okay. I heard some stuff.
Keith:        Oh, okay. I'm not that up — I'm just, I'm like, lateral to you.
Ali:        Oh, that's true. That's true. Yeah.
Keith:        Uh...
Ali:        Bye, everybody. Have a good night.
