Austin:         Now, where was this from team ABB all season, folks? If they'd been racing like this, they wouldn't be in this dilemma to begin with. What a story, what a season. It all comes down it this, the final lap. And, uh, let's just say for fun, there's some thunder hitting.
Ali:        Ooh!
Austin:        The clouds are, are growing over top above the sea, the waves are growing over top above the sea, the waves are rising below the racetrack. Folks, we are seeing Absolute Pluperfect put Trip's own strategy to the test for themselves. The difference is, Absolute cannot use speed to hold on. Another note here, Trip, you just — the way you're holding is just by fucking gunning it, right? You're not doing any sort of tricky maneuvers to try to block them out, you're not trying to like, take the turns a little extra wide, so you're in the middle to prevent people from passing on the left or the right. You're just going, as fast as you fucking can. And, I'm going to just tell you, it's exhilarating. This is the first time you've been, in the front in the final lap, in a long time. You know, everyone tried their best to hold their position, small gains, where you saw any gains at all. That's safe racing, isn't it?
Ali:        Yeah, you know, at the end of the race here, people just want to, you know, secure what they have.
Austin:        That's sort of like life, isn't it? You start, you try to get what you can, and you keep anybody else from taking it from you.
Ali:        That's the truth.
Austin:        By any means necessary, am I right?
Ali:        You are, indeed.
Austin:        Which is why I think, if you have any legal trouble, you should call 1-888-legalfix now.
[starting beeps]
Austin:         Wrench is out of the car. Like, the people aren't even on the podiums yet. And the media is immediately like, descending on Wrench via floaty hover drones, and questions about this accident. Once again, you, you failed to seal the deal. Are we ever going to see a first place win again from Trip Uncertainty? Well, that's the right name for you? Like, all that shit just —
Art:        Yeah, maybe if I get some good robots we'll see a first place finish. If the robots can close the deal, maybe I can close the deal. But right now I'm getting a bad car.
Austin:        Always... always second place, hm, Trip?
Art:        Yeah, go fuck yourself.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        Go-fuck-yourselfth place.

Austin:        Welcome to Friends at the Table, an actual play podcast focused on critical word building, smart characterization, and fun interaction between good friends. I'm your host, Austin Walker. Joining me today, Sylvi Clare.
Sylvi:        Hey, I'm Sylvi. You can find my Twitter, @sylvibullet and listen to my other show, emojidrome, wherever you get your podcasts.
Austin:        Ali Acampora.
Ali:        Hi. You can find me over at @ali_west on Twitter, and you can find the show over at @friends_table.
Austin:        And Art Martinez-Tebbel.
Art:        Hey, you can find me, just banging my fists on the gate outside of Tom Brady's house, demanding that he take responsibility for his actions.
Austin:        And, if you're hearing that and are confused, because we probably made some reference to it being November in the first recording, we want you to know it is now March. It's been a quarter of a year since we last played this game. Uh... four months, to...
Sylvi:        [giggling]
Art:        Four, yeah.
Austin:        Just about to the day. It was —
Art:        I mean, Tom Brady timeline, a lot's happened.
Austin:        A lot has happened, sorry — [unintelligible]
Art:        Tom Brady catch up —
Ali:        What's happened in the last four months?
Sylvi:        Maybe —
Art:        Well, he lost in the playoffs.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Ali:        Not about Tom Brady, [chuckling] I mean about us. What did we do? [laughing]
Austin:        What did we do?
Sylvi:        Oh.
Ali:        We were busy.
Art:        Well, I reacted to a lot of [chuckling] Tom Brady news.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Oh!
Ali:        Yeah, Art was like, I can't record today. I'm going through a lot.
Art:        [chuckles]
Austin:        Sorry, I'm trying to swat a moth.
Sylvi:        Wait — oh.
Austin:        In real life.
Sylvi:        Real life, okay.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        A moth. There's a moth.
Sylvi:        I thought there was like — the last 4 months...
Ali:        [wheezes laughing]
Austin:        That's not one of my pieces of news. That would be very funny, though.
Ali:        Oh, but that reminds — okay, so, well, Austin, are you still —
Austin:        I got it.
Ali:        Okay, you're doing that right now.
Austin:        I'm here.
Ali:        Then we should continue with the show. I was, I've been thinking, because we were talking about spring, I've been thinking about Springtime, and I'm wondering in New Yorkers are going to be tasked with killing a bug again this year, like we were last year.
Austin:        What was the last year bug?
Ali:        There was like a spotted something fly that like —
Austin:        Never saw one.
Ali:        Wow. I killed one. I saw one, on the steps of the subway, and I was like, “oh, shit! There's the bug!”
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        Uh-huh...
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        Damn, they just got Banjo Kazooie collectibles in New York? Holy shit!
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali:        [laughing] Yeah. Ugh. Unfortunately, it's part of the Eric Adams NFT program.
Austin:        I was going to say, yeah, I was going to say. Yeah, uh-huh.
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:        Unbelievable, we have the fucking —
Art:        What?
Austin:        Our mayor —
Art:        On earth are you talking about?
Austin:        Uh, which part?
Ali:        [chuckling]
Art:        The bug part, the... any of it.
Austin:        The bad mayor part? Okay, well, you're from New York. So you have to understand, New York elects bad people as mayors.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        And then they're each bad in a unique and new way.
Ali:        This one's a crypto guy.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        This guy's a crypto guy, and he's...
Art:        This guy's a crypto guy.
Austin:        He has high swag ambitions.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        But I would say that his [chuckling] that his reach exceeds his grasp.
Sylvi:        Is that a real quote?
Ali:        Yeah, 100 percent.
Austin:        Uh, it may as well be.
Sylvi:        Fucking hell!
Ali:        He was like —
Austin:        I think he was talking about.
Ali:        “During Covid, New York doesn't have any swag anymore. We've got to get rid of the masks so we can have swag again.”
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Sylvi:        Oh, my fucking god.
Ali:        Yeah...
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Sylvi:        Do you remember Norm, the Toronto city councilman who tweeted a bunch of shit to be like, cool with people? So just that on a bigger scale?
Austin:        Ugh...
Sylvi:        And I hate it. I think that guy got like, elected, non-elected or died or, I don't know. I don't see him anymore, he can go fuck himself.
Austin:        Oh my god. Oh, I see, I see.
Sylvi:        Whatever, he's a conservative dickhead.
Austin:        This is, who wore it better? Me in the 1980s or Drake at last night's Raptor game —
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        And it's like a picture of him in bad glasses. Uh, it's him saying Harambe should have been Time's person of the year. This guy sucks.
Sylvi:        Yeah, yeah, Norm Kelly's the worst.
Austin:        Who, who hugs better, me or Drake? Stop it.
Sylvi:        Yeah. He's 80, I hope God comes for him soon. Anyway, let's move on to the show! [chuckling]
Austin:        Today, we are playing Gravity Rip, a Sci-Fi racing RPG by Luke Westaway with illustrations by Colin Craeker. It has been 4 months since we've played, which means I should do a quick summary. I relistened to our game, uh, which was like, I can give us a quick, quick reminder. But, can we start with you reintroducing who you were all playing, with your name, your car name, your chaos theory score, your, uh, uh, description of your machine, and then your acceleration and weight scores?
Sylvi:        Uh, yeah. I can go first, since I'm on the left here.
Austin:        Yeah, sounds good.
Sylvi:        Uh, my character's name is Wrench. Her pronouns are she and her. Uh, my Chaos theory score is 2. Should I go through the volts and stuff as well?
Austin:        No, we'll — nah, that's fine.
Sylvi:        Uh, Wrench is the mechanic who brought the team together and had to race, because they couldn't find a third racer. Her machine is the Cherry Bomb, which is, I literally just said the Trans Am 20,000 from Red Line, except it's red now, and I stand by it.
Austin:        Yep!
Sylvi:        And its max integrity is 8.
Austin:        Yes. And it's — With acceleration and weight?
Sylvi:        Its acceleration is 0 and its weight is 2.
Austin:        Oh, wait, so then its max acceleration, or, sorry, its max integrity is 10 —
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        It's just that you got knocked down by 2, to 8.
Sylvi:        Yes.
Austin:        So that number is recurrent integrity, there. Important note, since we're going to... since some of these are lower than others.
Sylvi:        I misread the way the character sheet was laid out.
Austin:        No worries, I totally get it. I did the same thing earlier today. Uh, Ali.
Ali:        Uh, yeah. I'm playing Froggy, whose pronouns are they/them. Froggy's background is that they're a former street racer trying to make it big in the pro scene. [chuckles] Uh, my machine is the Sharpshooter, that's been facecast as The Reactor by Gene Winfield, you can look that up.
Austin:        Right, yeah.
Ali:        It's a historical TV car, the Joker drove it, question mark? Catwoman drove it, I think?
Austin:        Catwoman, I think Catwoman.
Ali:        I think the Joker drove it, but then it was decorated with cat stuff. But this is here nor there.
Sylvi:        [giggling]
Ali:        Is that it?
Austin:        Uh-uh. Acceleration, weight, and integrity. Yeah.
Ali:        Oh, sure. My acceleration is 2, my weight is 0, and my integrity is 6.
Austin:        There you go. Uh, Art.
Art:        Hey, I'm playing Trip Uncertainty. Pronouns he/him. I didn't write down my background —
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Art:        I think because I was like —
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        Well, I'll remember, we're going to pick this up right away.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Art:        And then it was a third of a year or whatever we said it was.
Austin:        A quarter, a quarter of a year.
Art:        But I think..
Austin:        It'll be a third of a year by the time they hear it.
Art:        Well, I mean it'll be...
Sylvi:        Oh my god.
Art:        But, I think the background was like a, like a hotshot young, uh, racer.
Austin:        Nope!
Art:        From like a racing — no?
Ali:        [laughing] No.
Austin:        None of this is right.
Ali:        [laughing] You were like a, you were like a, you were like a guy who's been on the scene for a little bit.
Austin:        Yeah, you were like a middle-aged, washed-up racer past his prime. [laughing]
Art:        Uh, I'm going to write it down this time.
Austin:        Yeah, uh, the only reason I know for sure middle-aged is, well I guess you could have started very young. But then we have a whole sidebar where one of us, I think Ali is playing, uh, briefly is voicing Jill, one of our race commentators, and notes that we haven't seen moves like this from Trip for 20 years.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Art:        Wow.
Austin:        So that means you've been racing for 20 years. I guess maybe if you had started at like 16 or 18, you'd be like, late 30s, which isn't quite middle-age, but it's getting there.
Art:        I mean, how long are we living? Uh...
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Damn, true. Uh...
Art:        Great. So, I, I remember like, having a racing background. I guess I just didn't remember it being 20 years. So, yeah. Uh, the machine, the, the chaos score is 5.
Austin:        Yep. Which means you're very chaotic. Just to contextualize that, I guess other people have just heard the previous.
Art:        Yeah, which I think is why I got young in here. But I guess you can be chaotic at any age.
Austin:        Yeah. I, I've got to tell you, listening back to this episode, Art, I had huge, like, Danny McBride character, do you know what I mean? Uh —
Art:        Uh-huh, yeah, that makes sense. I think Danny McBride and that Will Ferrell racing movie might have been —
Ali:        Mmm.
Austin:        Yeah, sure, Talladega Nights. Talladega Nights.
Art:        Talladega Nights, yeah.
Austin:        A movie we once watched with someone who hated it... so much.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        [gasping]
Art:        Well, we made them watch it out of spite, so...
Sylvi:        It was really fucked up of you guys to make me watch that movie, by the way.
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Ha-ha! It was not you. It was someone we, we had, had issues with.
Ali:        Oh...
Art:        Well, it was like the free movie that came with like, whatever Playstation had just come out.
Austin:        It was a Playstation 3, yeah. He'd gotten a Playstation 3, and we like insisted that we use it to watch [chuckling] Talladega Nights.
Art:        Instead of like, they wanted to like, [laughing] play Playstation 3.
Austin:        What came out at launch for the PS3, yeah, what games?
Sylvi:        The Playstation doesn't have any —
Austin:        It's got no games!
Ali:        Who was this?
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        Uh, it was, it was someone we've mentioned on the show before. [laughing] A famous Friends at the Table target.
Ali:        [gasping]
Austin:        Yes, Sylvi, it was.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        Sylvi in the chat.
Ali:        Wow, okay.
Austin:        Yep. Uh-huh. Uh, don't, you know, when you're at college you make maneuvers, and one of those maneuvers was like, “we should really watch Talladega Nights.” Also, that movie's fine, or, you know, I haven't seen it in —
Art:        That's, I think that movie was pretty good.
Austin:        Mmm...
Art:        I haven't watched it in a while.
Austin:        You know what? I've decided I'm not going to vouch for it, because I haven't seen it in however many years this has been.
Sylvi:        Academy award-winning script-writer Adam McKay.
Austin:        Oh my god. Uh-huh.
Art:        The scene I remember from that and really liking is when the one guy insists on praying to an infant Jesus —
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        And another character points out how weird it is, and so the other character just doubles down and makes it a more and more baby Jesus. And that's funny, so —
Austin:        Right. Mm-hm. Dear 8 pound, 6 ounce newborn infant Jesus, yeah.
Art:        Yeah, uh-huh. Great. Funny. Funny stuff, and that's, uh, what's-his-name.
Austin:        That's Will Ferrell.
Art:        No, it's the other one.
Austin:        No, one what says it is Will Ferrell.
Sylvi:        No, that is Will Ferrell who does, says that — I know this because —
Austin:        It's Ricky Bobby.
Sylvi:        I went to school with a guy who quoted that all the time, and I hated him.
Austin:        I looked it up. I couldn't quote it from, from my heart. I had to look it up. So...
Art:        Well, in my heart, that'll always be the other one.
Austin:        The one who plays, uh, what's-his-face, on what's-it-called.
Sylvi:        Uh, John C. Reilly?
Austin:        John C. Reilly.
Art:        Yeah, that's him.
Austin:        Yeah, yeah. Uh, anybody want bonus points for, for, uh, figuring out what I was referencing it?
Sylvi:         The dairy bus on Winning Time?
Austin:        No, but that's a good one. That's a good one.
Sylvi:        Was it Dewey Cox?
Austin:        It's not Dewey Cox.
Sylvi:        Dewey Cox is also a good one.
Austin:        That's —
Sylvi:        He's in Chicago.
Austin:        Yeah.
Sylvi:        No? Okay. I've run out of John C. Reilly roles.
Austin:        It's, it was, it was Dr. Steve Brule. It was Dr. Steve Brule, is what I was referencing.
Sylvi:        It was the obvious one? All right, yeah?
Austin:        Yeah, it was the obvious one.
Sylvi:        The, the one that everyone else would have gone to first, got it.
Austin:        Yes. Yeah, you went for deep cuts, as a true fan [unintelligible]
Sylvi:        Well, I watched that Lakers show yesterday, so that's why a thought about that.
Austin:        Ah, I see. How was that? Is it good?
Sylvi:        Honestly, it's pretty all right, and I don't like —
Austin:        All right.
Sylvi:        Speaking of Adam McKay, I don't like him that much, but I thought this was okay.
Austin:        Okay. Yeah.
Sylvi:        Uh...
Austin:        I'm, I'm, I'm more interested in him doing that than his like, I have to be a serious —
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        You know, didactic filmmaker stuff.
Sylvi:        There's definitely some shit —
Art:        Yeah, I'm interested in him —
Sylvi:        That will make your eyes roll, though, in this.
Austin:        Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Okay.
Sylvi:        It's Adam McKay, it's going to happen.
Austin:        Sure.
Sylvi:        But for the most part, his shit works better in a TV format about something that isn't the end of the world.
Austin:        Yep.
Art:        Yeah, like a Nascar race or something.
Sylvi:        Yeah, exactly. Anyway.
0:13:53.8        
Austin:        Anyway.
Art:        Uh, Trip's car is the Liminal Space.
Austin:        [chuckling] Right.
Art:        My description written down is, [laughing] like an F1 car, but future-y.
Austin:        Mmm, that's the detail we, we're here for.
Art:        We had, I had a car last time, but who knows what chat it was in, or if discord even scrolls back that far.
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        Uh, and I think I have it marked off as acceleration 3, weight negative 1.
Austin:        That's correct, that's what you have it marked down on.
Art:        But my integrity is still, I have not repaired anything from...
Austin:        No, your, your, your integrity is 1. You're about to blow up, 100 percent. Speaking of the race, let me give you the quick summary of what happened last time. We introduced you, uh, the, the team that is sponsored by the Asteroid Belt Barber Shop, and we set up the premise that was, it was the end of the racing season, and y'all needed a certain amount of winnings to be able to stay in the league, basically, as the season was coming to a close, which meant that a combination of like, you had to win a certain amount via racing, but then also you could get some more by knocking other racers off the track, or slamming into them and getting highlights, basically. Uh, your primary rivals in the race, we didn't do like a lot of pregame setup, so much as just saying, y'all had kind of a rough season. You are also, again, being sponsored by a tiny business. The Asteroid Belt Barber Shop is like a local, Atlantic City barbershop, in a way that was like, not able to compete in the big, future Nascar, like, you know, you're, you're, we're not talking about a big mega-corporation here, despite it being a cyber punk game. You know, this is just a local, neighborhood barbershop, trying to get its name out there. Uh, your primary rivals during this race, uh, I'd say there were three of them. The first, and the one, the person who ends up taking home the, the prize here, was Absolute Pluperfect, uh, who you may recall [chuckling] looks like one of the twins from the Matrix.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        Uh, a real piece of shit. If players, or if listeners, rather, have heard, or players have heard the intro to the America's Playground, the Intros to the America's Playground arc, the mall, mall kids arc, that is Absolute Pluperfect —
Sylvi:        Oh, okay.
Austin:        Talking a bunch of fucking bullshit about how the world used to be better, and how they wish they could have gone back in time to live in Bluff City circa like 1900 or whatever, you know. Uh, uh, and then, uh, uh, second place was you, Art. Sorry, it was you, Trip, Trip uncertainty. And then, there was a Trio of racers that y'all were up against. Uh, who were sponsored by, uh, a, a potato chip company, or I guess a snack food company called Tiger Bite. And that of course was Tate, in the plain potato chip car. SC, got a big truck with Sour Cream and Onion stylings, and then, uh, baby, AKA BB, AKA the Striped Sensation, AKA The Second Heat, I have written down here AKA Mr. Liplicker, AKA Tony Hu, you already know what it is, sit down up front so that people behind you can see me, who is barbecue, BB, Baby. Who is way back here in the very fast and maneuverable Barbecue Chip, uh, car. And then the third rival was of course, uh, Sonny Veranda the Third, AKA Fastos, but with an F. And I say but with an F because it's, of course, named after the Eternals character Phastos, but with a PH.
Sylvi:        [cracking up]
Austin:        Uh, he'd previously been known as Sonic, uh, because he was fan of classic films, uh, and that's why.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        It's still a good joke. It's been 4 months. Let me tell you, I still am happy with that joke.
Sylvi:        Yeah. Long enough time for it to get me again.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Uh-huh. Uh, played by Chris Penn, shoutouts.
Ali:        Oh, wow.
Austin:        Rest in Peace, Chris Penn.
Ali:        We got Chris Penn?
Austin:        Because that's what, Sonny Veranda was originally played by Chris Penn, so I think he just looks a lot like his great-grandfather.
Ali:        Okay.
Austin:        Anyway, uh, that race was hectic, uh, filled with numbers. Uh, lots of, lots of us learning how the game worked. Uh, towards the end of it, things got really tight. There was, uh, a near-victory from Trip, but couldn't make it happen. Uh, again, Chris Penn, Sonny Veranda, knocked BB out of the competition. Uh, I think it was either BB or it was SC. I think it must've been BB, because there's no way he could have come for SC's big truck. Also, he's back there with BB, so that makes the most sense. Knocked him out of the race, and then, and then he himself was knocked out of the race. Uh, uh, you know, as, as a follow up. And then, uh, Wrench, looking to get a little more extra, extra cash winnings, you knocked out a non-rival NPC named Callista something, Callista Lee.
Sylvi:        Wasn't it like a pretty bad take down, too?
0:19:10.4        
Austin:        It was a, you were one, one point off from killing Callista.
Ali:        [gasps]
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        And then, right after that, uh, there was another, there was a crash into the wreckage of Callista Lee's Keen X1, and it caused a huge pileup behind you. So as you got to, as you got out of your car, after passing the finish line, media kind of holodrones started swarming you, and trying to like, get into your head and see what you thought about the huge accident you indirectly caused. And then, uh, instead of letting you take that heat, our good friend Trip here started causing a, throwing a tantrum, is what I would say —
Art:        How dare you.
Austin:        [chuckling] Yelling and screaming, uh, and getting that you're attention. Blaming the pit drones, the pit robots, uh, for your loss. Uh, telling, uh, Absolute Pluperfect that they were, I believe, go-fuck-yourselfth place, or something. [chuckling] Because they said that you were always second best, or second place, or something. Uh, and so, uh, that's —
Art:        Yeah, that's... that's true.
Austin:        By the way, that's where you got your bonus radical point here, back, your radical point came back from doing that. Uh... and I think that, the very last thing that we said was, someone shows up in your repair bay, your garage, uh, to make you an offer. And that's where we were when we left off. I suspect, most of today's session will be mostly the non-race portion of this game. So, if you had trouble last time following some of the race stuff, I think most of what's going to happen today is going to be investigation stuff, where we're basically playing Lasers and Feelings. Those chaos and theory scores of a very simple system by which, if you're doing something chaotic and impulsive, you want to roll a D6 and make it be, uh, uh, low. And if you're doing something analytical, you want it to be high, or theory-based, basically. You want to roll, uh, high above your number, to make an analytical thing happen, or low under your number in order to make something chaotic happen. Uh, any questions, before we jump into it? Okay. Let's see, it sounds like no.
Ali:        [unintelligible] this game, right? It's a question.
Austin:        Yeah, we should have that PDF open for sure.
Ali:        [giggling] Okay.
Austin:        Again, this stuff, pretty straghtforward, at least. Uh, there is a person standing in the doorway to your garage. Uh, I would say that they're a, he's a, you know, probably upper 30s, maybe lower 40s now. We didn't — I don't know the exact dates of where this game is in relation to the previous one. So let's say, mid-30s. I say previous one because I'm referencing our tales from the loop game. The person you're looking at is a, uh, a guy wearing kind of a long, not like a cybertrenchcoat, just a regular trenchcoat, like a brown one, with a pair of acid wash jeans on, some old sneakers, an old University of Kentucky Hat, like a cap, on. Uh, and, uh, on the lapel of this trenchcoat is a little, like a sakura blossom pin.
0:22:39.4        Uh, uh, red pin that has kind of a cherry, cherry blossom flower on it. I'll post it in the Bluff City chat. Uh, and, I don't think any of you would have known this guy, uh, uh, but the viewer might recognize his outfit as a much older Ronny Highsmith Jr, one of our characters from Tales from the Loop. And he does a little, like fun little knock on the frame of the door, even though he's already opened the door, to like get your attention.
Austin (as Ronny):        Hey, is anyone, uh, is anyone in here? You guys around?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Oh god — you're not with the news, right?
Austin (as Ronny):        Oh, no, no, no. No, definitely.
Austin:        Starts to like, reach into interior coat pockets, to try to produce something, and like, can't quite find it. He's like, oh, right. And then reaches into his back jeans pocket, uh, and produces a wallet, and in the wallet is a, uh, like a private investigator badge. There's some sort of, there's some sort of like, approved Atlantic City, Greater Bluffington Beach Area, you know, PI license that you need to have, and he's like —
Austin (as Ronny):        I'm a, I'm a private investigator. I'm not here to investigate you. Uh, could I, could I, could I come in and maybe ask you guys a few things? Not, again, I'm not investigating, investigating you, but, you know.
Ali (as Froggy):        Who are you investigating?
Austin (as Ronny):        Well, actually I have an opportunity, uh, that maybe you could help with.
Ali (as Froggy):        I'm not investigating anyone.
Austin (as Ronny):        Well, not yet. You haven't let me tell you the opportunity.
Art (as Trip):        Mmm...
Austin (as Ronny):        Can I just come in?
Ali (as Froggy):        Yeah, yeah.
Austin (as Ronny):        Look, I just want to prove I'm not a vampire —
Austin:        He steps in, steps back out.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art (as Trip):        That doesn't prove anything. We already said you could.
Austin (as Ronny):        Well, if you'd given me a second — [chuckling] I'm not, I'm not a vampire.
Ali (as Froggy):        You brought it up, buddy.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Why would you say that? The more I'm thinking, you might be a vampire.
Art (as Trip):        Yeah, this raises a lot of questions already —
Austin (as Ronny):        Okay.
Austin:        He crosses himself. [chuckles]
Art (as Trip):        Can vampires do that?
Austin (as Ronny):        No! Probably not.
Art (as Trip):        Mmm...
Austin (as Ronny):        I'm coming in.
Austin:        And comes in and closes the door behind him.
Austin (as Ronny):        Uh, I saw the race out there, and I know things seemed a little rough, but I just think, first and foremost, as a race fan, you know, I got a Chevy myself, out in the, the parking lot. I mean, it's not as nice as your cars, but you know, I think I do a pretty good job keeping it up, if you want to look at it, that'd be great.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Yeah, I would... sure. I'll take a look at it.
Austin (as Ronny):        Not right this second, just, let me finish. But afterwards, I'd love to. It's an old, it's kind of a classic, you know what I mean?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Really?
Austin (as Ronny):        I mean, you know, a 1988, you know —
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Wow. I was expecting like a 2004.
Austin (as Ronny):        No, no. Uh-uh. Any, anyway. Uh... I mean, I could show you a picture — do you want to see a picture of it?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Uh, yes. Of course.
Austin:        [chuckling] This is a very strange — okay. [chuckling] He, in his wallet, he like flips through some photos, and then finds a photo of it. Like, you know, an old-timey wallet that has like a fold-out thing.
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        And then, like, presses it to project a hologram of it up, basically, like a 3D, spiny, you know. You know how this works.
Sylvi:        Yeah, I know what you mean.
Austin:        Yeah, and then, uh, as it's spanning, the song, “Chatahootchie,” by Alan Jackson plays —
Sylvi:        Oh my god.
Austin:        Uh, like behind it, you know. Uh, so... uh, and he's like —
Austin (as Ronny):        Yeah, it's, it's my baby, it's my baby, you know?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Wow, she's beautiful.
Austin (as Ronny):        Thank you, thank you. Uh, it's actually, it's he/him pronouns on the car.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Oh, I'm sorry.
Austin (as Ronny):        I appreciate it, thank you.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        He's beautiful.
Austin (as Ronny):        Uh, he is. I'm very proud. Uh, I think he's pretty proud, too, but I don't have the AI in him yet. I'm saving up to get it into the old classic models, it's whole thing, you know?
Art (as Trip):        What brought you here today?
Austin (as Ronny):        I got an opportunity [chuckling] for you.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin (as Ronny):        Uh, again, I really respect the work you do out there, and I know times are tough for a lot of us. Uh, and I think that you could help me out. Uh, I'm going to say it straight up. I think the three of you got real integrity.
Austin:        Eyes wander over to the Liminal Space that's falling apart, currently, in this garage. Uh, back to you.You
Sylvi:        [chuckling]
Austin (as Ronny):        And there's some bad business happening here in town. And I think maybe you could help me out. Get into some places I, uh, that I can't get into, or am not allowed to get into anymore. And help me figure out some... bad stuff that's going on. And, it has to do with that piece of shit, Absolute Pluperfect. So I thought maybe between that and the fact that you're kind of hometown heroes, you might be able to maybe help out. Also, I could give you a stipend, a little per diem. Maybe.
0:27:44.7        
Art (as Trip):        That's a lot of, that's a lot of stuff. That was...
Austin (as Ronny):        I mean, I'll lay it all out. Again, Absolute Pluperfect, piece of shit.
Art (as Trip):        I agree.
Austin (as Ronny):        Corruption in the city, question mark? I think there is. Three, uh, you get paid.
Art (as Trip):        Yeah, I, uh, uh, sounds great. I'm, I'm not sure you're not a vampire, but —
Austin (as Ronny):        Okay. Well, do you have any holy water, do you have a cross, you got a [unintelligible] water?
Art (as Trip):        No I, don't have any of these things, but like, you, you —
Austin (as Ronny):        Do you want to spill some water, I'll step over it, proving I'm allowed to —
Art (as Trip):        It's running water, not spilled water.
Austin (as Ronny):        Well, if you spill it fast enough, it's running.
Art (as Trip):        Mmm, see, this sounds like someone who is a vampire, trying to trick me into thinking they're not a vampire. I don't, I don't want to like...
Austin (as Ronny):        All right, how about this.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Trip, I don't think a vampire could drive a car this nice. I think, we should trust him.
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali:        [chuckling]
Art (as Trip):        What? It's like you've never even... I —
Sylvi (as Wrench):        A vampire can't love something like this.
Austin (as Ronny):        Mm-hm. No love in a vampire's heart, is what I always say.
Ali (as Froggy):        What?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        You'll let me look at the engine if I take the job, right?
Austin (as Ronny):        Of course.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Okay, cool. Guys, we should take the job.
Art (as Trip):        You — oh my god.
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali (as Froggy):        This guy's anti-vampire.
Austin (as Ronny):        I'm not anti-vampire, I don't —
Ali (as Froggy):        You just said vampires can't love!
Austin (as Ronny):        And I can, and I can —
Sylvi (as Wrench):        I said that.
Austin (as Ronny):        Yes, you did, and I agree. But that doesn't mean that I'm anti-vampire. I — trees can't love, and I, I love trees.
Art (as Trip):        What?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Well, hold on, now.
Ali:        [laughing]
Ali (as Froggy):        Like you've ever seen a tree before.
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali:        How far future are we? [laughing]
Austin:        I think that's fair. And I think he says —
Austin (as Ronny):        You know, when I was a kid, you believe it or not, this place used to have some trees. In fact, I used to have a little clubhouse out near some trees, in the marsh land. All gone now, of course. Or, mostly. Anyway... do you want the details on the, on the gig?
Art (as Trip):        Yeah.
Sylvi:        I'm looking expectantly at — okay, good. I was — Wrench wasn't going to answer for everyone.
Art (as Trip):        I'm not like, but like... I just think everyone should knowledge that like, that there's a, there's a lingering vampire question.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        I mean, isn't there always?
Austin (as Ronny):        I'll meet you for breakfast tomorrow. We'll go out in the daylight, and then you'll see I'm not a vampire.
Art (as Trip):        If we're all alive in the morning.
Austin (as Ronny):        Okay, well, I'm not going to stay with you all night. If I were a vampire, why would I even, this would be a — if a wanted to eat you as a vampire, I wouldn't have knocked on the door and come in. I would have just waited until you were outside.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Well, you wouldn't have been able to come in, because we didn't invite you.
Austin (as Ronny):        You, you're right, that's true.
Art (as Trip):        Yeah.
Austin (as Ronny):        But you have to go outside at some point, probably.
Sylvi (as Wrench):         Hey, you'd be surprised.
Art (as Trip):        Sounds like you've thought a lot about this.
Austin (as Ronny):        Oh, boy. I'm a private investigator, I had to think about, hey, what if they, the door is locked and I can't open it, and then I need to meet you outside, and maybe give you the job there. And — the point is, let me break down this job for you.
Art (as Trip):         Great.
Austin:         Flips through some more photos in the wallet, and hits a few — not buttons, the photos themselves, projecting different images up. Uh, one of the images produces some sort of cool background song, some sort of like you're looking at the galaxy map type music, you know what I mean? Like, the, the information montage song is playing in the background. Uh, and he says
Austin (as Ronny):        All right, this is Absolute Pluperfect, you already know this. Weird, bioandroid guy —
Austin:        That's not true. I believe Absolute Pluperfect uses they/them —
Austin (as Ronny):        Guy, uh, uh, gender neutral guy, not, [chuckling] not he/him guy. Uh, uh, and what you might not know about, about Pluperfect is, Pluperfect is the child of this, uh, uh, also robotic individual, uh, Red Frame Pluperfect.
Austin:        And a much simpler-looking robot shows up. I mean, again, you look at, you look at the twins from the matrix, and you go — are they aliens? Are they vampires? Are they robots or androids? They could be any of those. This, this, the sort of father of Absolute Pluperfect, definitely an android. Definitely a robot of some kind, uh, kind of like a, like a red, chrome, uh, uh, maybe, maybe like a red chrome version of the I, Robot robots, do you know what I'm talking about?
Sylvi:        Okay, yeah.
Austin:        The robots from the Will Smith movie, I, Robot.
Art:        Yeah, a lot of I, Robot content on the Twitter timeline recently. I don't know what's going on.
Ali:        Oh.
Austin:        It's popping right now, you know?
Ali:        Is it?
Art:        It's popping right now.
Austin:        I feel like I, Robot just came up. Within 6 months, I, Robot's come up. Or, was it, was it in a dream, that I insulted someone who liked I, Robot, and then I woke up feeling really bad about it?
Ali:        [chuckling]
Art:        Well, you know what they say, Austin, if you dream about insulting someone about I, Robot, you better wake up and apologize.
Austin:        You better apologize? I've been thinking about that line non-stop for a week, Art. I don't know why —
Ali:        [wheezes]
Austin:        But I've been thinking about that line, for a week. Harvey Keitel in, in Reservoir Dogs, says, “you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.”
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        It's very, it's very good.
Art:        And before that, I think it was Muhammad Ali, who said it about [unintelligible]
Austin:        Oh, sure. Is that where, is that? Yeah, that makes more sense. Yes. It's —
Sylvi:        Yeah, that's.
Austin:        It's in one of his interviews, right?
Art:        Yeah, about someone or other.
Austin:        Ugh... who is it?
Art:        The man talked a lot of trash, it's hard to... [chuckles]
Austin:        That's fair. Uh, anyway... in front of you are now these two pictures of the Pluperfects, and, uh, the, the third thing that Ronny pulls up is like an accounts, uh, uh, balance sheet type thing, in the way that bad cyberpunk stories visualize how money moves between bank accounts, you know? It's just like a big, fake bank holograms and files moving between them, or dollar bills floating between them. Uh, and he explains that over the last 6 months, we've seen a lot of transfers going between the Pluperfect, the various Pluperfect companies, and, uh, the, the Atlantic City redevelopment fund, which is weird, because the Pluperfects don't actually own any of the casinos, and the redevelopment fund is supposed to be about getting more money to the casinos, right? Which is bad, but it's weird that that money is not even going to the bad place it's supposed to go to, and instead seems like it's being shuffled into some other thing. Uh, uh, and he kind of goes on to explain that there is, he thinks that they're developing something big.
0:34:22.4        And he's being very gestural, there's lots of big, open arm movements, and not a lot of clarity, let's say, on what that big thing is here?. Uh, and you're not sure if that's just because he doesn't know what he's talking about, or what? And then kind of explains that like, the real problem here is that, uh, he, on an earlier, kind of in part of this investigation, got spotted trying to, uh, tail Pluperfect, both of the Pluperfects, and as such, now has been, uh, kind of banned from any of those premises. Plus, he's not really allowed to be at racing venues, uh, uh, and like, certainly not back in garage space, and especially not in well-secured garages, like the Pluperfect garage. Uh, and so, he kind of lays out to you that like, what he needs from you is to, is to, uh, look for certain files on either the, the father or child's kind of personal data cyber unit, you know, the little, the little PDA, a little, you know. It's the future, so it should just be some sort of like, implanted phone, but it's Bluff City, which means that instead, it gets to be like a little Palm Pilot or something, [chuckling] that is, that is, uh, that the, both of the Pluperfects keep these things on them at all times. And so, if you can get close to one of them and somehow hack into it, and get that data, you'll be paid handsomely. Uh, and there will be, you know, a part 2 to this job where you get paid even more. I can tell you, he's offering you... where's that money I wrote down? Let's see. Uh... I don't remember the exact, how money pays out into volts here, but... did I delete how much money —
Art:        Don't we have credits and volts?
Austin:        You do have credits and volts?
Art:        Or, crits and volts. 2,000 crits equals one volt.
Austin:        Sure. So then, was offering, is going to offer you 10,000 crits, just straight up for this first part, uh, and then is going to multiple that quite a bit more if you stick around for what follows.
Austin (as Ronny):        Simple. Go in, get these files, get them back to me.
Art:        Well, I mean, much like a character in a zombie movie doesn't know what zombies are, I have to assume that I've never seen a noir movie, so I think this is a great idea —
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        And we're going to make a quick buck.
Austin:        Yes.
Art (as Trip):        Yeah, great.
Ali (as Froggy):        We can't find a vampire who's just going to pay us to race, and not steal stuff?
Austin (as Ronny):        I, I — Froggy, I'm not —
Ali:        [laughing]
Ali (as Froggy):        I was speaking to the group, here, but you can make your case, I guess.
Austin (as Ronny):        I was just going to say —
Ali (as Froggy):         We're racers! We're not investigators.
Austin (as Ronny):        I know, but you've —
Sylvi (as Wrench):        I'm not even a racer.
Austin (as Ronny):        You care about this city, right? You're from here.
Ali (as Froggy):        Yeah, yeah.
Austin (as Ronny):        I know you've gotten your hands dirty before. Running with those street gangs, down below. I'm not, I have nothing against it. I'm just saying, you know, sometimes to make the world a better place you've got to break into a few buildings, take a few snapshots, steal some files, potentially derail a —
Art (as Trip):        That was some people who were dicks.
Austin (as Ronny):        Right, exactly.
Art (as Trip):        Exactly!
Ali (as Froggy):        Yeah, yeah. Fine.
Austin (as Ronny):        Anyway, the file you're looking for is called, it's — jackpotsupreme.zip
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Uh, yeah?
Austin (as Ronny):        That's all I, that's all I could get. I saw it, I... got booted from the system before I could download it myself.
Art (as Trip):        It sounds like you buy at the concessions stand.
Austin (as Ronny):        That's probably how they're hiding it. Oh, look, that's just like, a big pizza, and then you don't look at it, and instead, it's a nefarious agenda.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Yeah, I was going to say, doesn't a jackpot supreme have like mushrooms, peppers, pepperoni, and like, something else on it?
Ali (as Froggy):        Mmm.
Art (as Trip):        Supreme means, uh, sour cream. That's, that's what you're missing.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        That sounds disgusting, never mind.
Austin (as Ronny):        I'm making a bad face, I don't like the sound of that.
Art (as Trip):        I'm just telling you what supreme means.
Austin (as Ronny):        Does that mean sour cream? Sour cream supreme?
Art (as Trip):        You ever [unintelligible] at a taco bell? Supreme means sour cream.
Austin (as Ronny):        Yeah, but on a pizza, supreme doesn't mean that.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Yeah... at Taco Bell.
Austin (as Ronny):        On a pizza, it means you get all the toppings. Right?
Sylvi:        I thought so. I'm looking this up.
Austin (as Ronny):        I think it means you get some cheeses, you get some peppers, some pepperoni.
Art (as Trip):         Some cheeses? You think most pizza places have more than one cheese?
Austin (as Ronny):        Place, places that have a supreme pizza.
Art (as Trip):        No, yeah, Pizza Hut has a supreme pizza, right?
Sylvi:        I'm just going to like, paste this description that I got, on Google, into the chat.
Austin:        Oh, this has all been in-character for me.
Ali:        [giggling]
Sylvi:        Oh, perfect. Well, I — I'm on my phone. [chuckling]
Austin:        [laughing] Okay, good, yes.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Okay, so Google's saying that supreme pizzas are traditionally topped with pepperoni, sausage, bell peppers, olives, and onions, making them — and I didn't write this — making them a cacophony of different tastes all on one slice.

Austin (as Ronny):        A cacophony isn't a good thing. [chuckles]
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Yeah, that's where it threw me, as well. Uh...
Art (as Trip):        Yeah, but here at the race, here at the track, it's all of that and sour cream.
Austin (as Ronny):        It's sour cream? Oh, is that part of a deal with SC, the driver from the Tiger Bite Corporation?
Art (as Trip):        I don't know the origins of it. I mean, that's — but it's like, you know, sometimes you get a pizza that's got like, like a dollop of ricotta on it —
Sylvi (as Wrench):         Wait, are you just saying this because SC's always wearing clothing that says Supreme on it?
Austin:        [laughing] Yeah, that adds up.
Austin (as Ronny):        Anyway, let's see what we can do, uh, with this investigation. I'll meet you tomorrow for breakfast. You bring me any news you've got tonight, any information, and we'll see where we go from there. My office, by the way, if you want to come over for breakfast, I can meet you out here too, but we've got a little place in the old airfield, just out of town. Uh, it'll say that it's a florist. It's not a florist and it's not a delivery — I mean, it is, we do make deliveries, and there is a florist component, but mostly we're an investigation bureau, at this point. So don't get confused about the signage.
0:41:06.6        
Ali (as Froggy):        You didn't bring us any flowers?
Austin:        Holds up a finger, reaches, uh, —
Ali:        [snorts]
Austin:        Behind him, and produces a single tulip.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art (as Trip):        That's classy.
Ali (as Froggy):        Been keeping that in your pocket this whole time?
Austin:        I have like a little, shows, there's a little slot in the back of the trenchcoat for exactly this reason, producing a single flower as a little trick.
Austin (as Ronny):        People love it.
Sylvi (as Wrench):         I don't know how I feel about that. I have a hard time trusting magicians.
Austin (as Ronny):        I'm not a magician, I'm an illusionist.
Austin:        We stole that, I can't use that [chuckling] joke.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        This is exactly why...
Austin:        [laughing] Ugh. All right. I think that's that scene.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        Uh, so yeah. What you know about — you know, I'll give you a little bit based on your, your ability to just quickly Google things, uh, Wrench, you were just saying you were Googling stuff anyway.
Sylvi:        Yeah, we've established Google exists now.
Austin:        We have. I mean, it's the real world. This is obviously the real with world.
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        So, the Pluperfects' own —
Art:        We'll never be free from Google.
Sylvi:        [shudders] Uh-huh.
Austin:        Mm-hm. Unfortunate.
Sylvi:        You made me sad.
Austin:        Uh, here are the businesses that have, that are owned by the Pluperfects, that the Pluperfects have a meaningful stake in, that are represented somewhere here in Atlantic City, or Bluffington beach. Legal fix now, which, someone cut a promo for in the middle of. I think Brobert, one of our commentators in a promo for legal fix now, in the last session, Red Frame Autodiagnostics, a sort of, uh, uh, mechanic shop. The Bluffington Beach Coin in Slot, or just Bluffington Beach Coin in Slot, which is a slot machine and kind of casino game manufacturer. Absolute, with an E, Vodka, a different Absolute vodka company.
Sylvi:        Ah, yeah.
0:43:00.7        
Austin:        The Telecomputics Double Incorporated Company. Pluperfect Centerprises, the Upper Crust Pizza and Casino, Pistol Pete's Pizza and Pesto, Funny Guys, the pizza shop that makes you laugh, and the Atlantic County Curtain and Drape Shop. So, they have a bunch of stuff there. It's not really a, we can go to all of these and — I mean, if you want to make this whole game [laughing] going to their various business interests and poking around, I guess we can do that. But that's what I quick Google search tells you, in terms of just —
Art:        What if we just go the pizza shop that makes you laugh, what if we just do one?
Austin:        We just do one, and then we just do, we just do a, it's — my, my idea on that is, it's a comedy club that has a pizza shop out front, and you can get pizza to go, but they really encourage you to stop and watch a set.
Art:        I'd rather die than go there. There's no way it's funny enough —
Ali:        Is it like a 2-slice minimum, or —
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Yeah, it's a 2-slice minimum!
Art:        [cracking up]
Austin:         Ugh... fuck.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        We've got to make this a real place now. All right, everybody, it's been great with Friends at the Table —
Art:        We've been wasting our talents, I think, in being a podcast, instead of —
Ali:        [snorts] to
Art:        Just making cursed businesses.
Austin:        Yeah, 100 percent.
Sylvi:        Yeah, I'm sure that's a thing that goes well for people, is making a bunch of cursed businesses over and over again.
Art:        Well, we're like, a little famous. I think we could get it off the ground.
Ali:        Uh-uh.
Austin:        I don't think we're that famous.
Ali:        Not that famous.
Sylvi:        This is [unintelligible] a little.
Austin:        Yeah.
Ali:        Garfield couldn't even manage it.
Austin:        Yeah, if Garfield couldn't do it, we can't do it. Are you kidding me?
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Art:        This is a better idea than anything Garfield's ever had.
Austin:        Anything?
Sylvi:        Anything? Hold on.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Garfield had some good ideas.
Ali:        Yeah.
Sylvi:        He went to Paris, that wasn't a bad idea.
Austin:        That's a great idea.
Art:        That wasn't Garfield's idea.
Austin:        No, Garfield was the first person to go Paris.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        Uh, so yeah. How do you go about investigating and trying to find this file?
Sylvi:        So, is, uh, it's Absolute Pluperfect, not Blue Perfect?
Austin:        It is Pluperfect, like a tense.
Sylvi:        Okay, I just wanted to make sure.
Austin:        Uh-huh. You got it.
Sylvi:        Uh, are there any other, like, racers under contract to the same team as them?
Austin:        Uh, no. They are the only, they, they are standalone. They are, as a reminder, are like, not even necessarily part of this local league that you're in. They are brought in as like, you know, almost as, not like a charity thing, but a sort of gimmick to get more eyes on the, it's like when a pro player, you know, does some sort of event with an amateur league, you know? Uh, so... or like, when like an NFL team plays against a Euro American football team. It's one of those things. Or when a European soccer team plays against a major league soccer, you know, American team, a US team, and just crushes them? That's what happens.
0:45:59.6        So, all said, you made a really great showing, by coming in second, Art. Uh, but yes, they're the only one on the Pluperfect racing team here —
Art:        I don't need your pity, Austin.
Austin:         [chuckling] But they do have a full garage and stuff, here on, at the racetrack that you could go investigate. Uh, you could tail Pluperfect, you could, I don't know. It's cyberpunk, it's neonoir, you tell me how you want to do an investigation, do it.
Ali:        We could tail somebody.
Austin:        Yeah? You want to do a little —
Art:        We're kind of conspicuous, aren't we? Because we like...
Ali:        [unintelligible]
Art:        I just got all the way in this person's face...
Austin:        You did.
Ali:        Well, you can play, you can play, you can play, uh, offense.
Austin:        Mmm.
Ali:        And get in this person's face a second time while we're sneaking around in their... phone.
Austin:        That's a plan.
Ali:        Or iPad.
Art:        Great.
Ali:        Or... [chuckling]
Art:        Do you feel like we're really close to like, people being really nostalgic for Palm Pilots?
Austin:        Yes. Or —
Art:        I don't want to like, name any names, but I feel like someone we know is within like 6 weeks of like —
Austin:        Keith J. Carberry.
Ali:        I was going to say Austin.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        No, I... I don't, no.
Ali:        Not a Palm Pilot, yeah. You're just in a phone place right now.
Austin:        I'm in a phone, I'm always in a phone place, though.
Ali:        [laughing] Fair.
Austin:        Uh, but I'm not going to get an old phone, like, I need it to work, you know?
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Uh, the thing that I'm actually, the thing that's actually happening, and I think I've shared this privately, is... we're at, uh, first generation iPhone interface nostalgia. That's happening. I saw someone a month ago post a bunch of icons from that first generation iPhone UI —
Ali:        Oh, yeah, yeah, that's been —
Austin:        And then I saw like, 3 people this week do it. So I think it's happening. Like, the little TV YouTube icon —
Art:        That's weird, because —
Austin:        You know what I'm talking about? All that shit.
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've seen those.
Art:        I was alive then, and it wasn't good.
Austin:        But they were 10 at the time, Art, and now they're 22, and thought it was cool, and now they, they, you know. This is how it goes. Shoutouts to our 22-year-old listeners.
Art:        Yeah.
Ali:        [wheezes] Do we like that idea? The, the — following the [unintelligible] around idea.
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Ali:        We can go to one of those stores.
Austin:        Uh, if you did want to tail Absolute, you could do that by... you could do that now. I mean, I guess you would imagine that Pluperfect would still be in their garage at this point. Uh, you know, I think that the sort of, you know, I think, Absolute Pluperfect is sort of a Tom Brady figure in the league [chuckling] uh, —
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        In that there's lots of obsession around their like —
Art:        All right, yeah.
Austin:        Post game — do you know what I mean? They're like, there's lots of, you know, mythologizing around what their process is. And everybody knows —
Art:        Oh, there's —
Austin:        Yeah, what's up?
Art:        There's just a Wikipedia page for like, weird shit Tom Brady does?
Austin:        [laughing] Probably not.
Sylvi:        There should be. Make a website for that, somebody.
Austin:        Ugh. I think that it's like, you know, has some sort of, you know, debrief, post-mortem of every single race, and doesn't even wait a day, right? Most people watch, watch their tapes, watch their footage, but they wait a day to do it. They spend the night kind of relaxing. Pluperfect's like, in the booth studying immediately. You know, uh, uh, handles some of the repairs themself. Deals with, uh, uh, you know, all of the, uh, media, in like a special, certain order. I don't know what that order is, but there's some sort of like, I like to answer questions from the, from the media people who are from the center of the country and then move outwards, because that's how I connect to my audience. [chuckles] You know? Very weird. So your Kansas City person gets their question answered before the Atlanta person does, you know? Uh, that's the sort of lifestyle that Absolute Pluperfect — drinks, you know, one, uh, cup of Absolute with an E vodka, neat, uh, during this night, and if they can't do that, they feel like shit for the rest of the week. Lots of very particular habits, here. Eats one raw tomato, you know? Anyway.
Sylvi:        I am wondering —
Austin:        So they're probably still going through that process.
Sylvi:        Should we fuck with that process? [chuckling]
Austin:        Oh, that's fun.
Art:        Mmm.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        That's fun.
Art:        I love it. I love this idea. My idea was, should we push them in front of a bus?
Austin:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        We can do that after, that be part of fucking up the process. I don't know if he planned for that, so like...
Austin:        [laughing] Uh... I, you know. It's up to y'all. Y'all tell me what you want to do.
Art:        We didn't, no one said no disintegrations, which, you know is a thing you have to say —
Austin:        [chuckling] You have to say. You're not being hired to [laughing] to capture Absolute Pluperfect as a bounty.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Art:        I said what I said.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Art:         [chuckling] No one said no disintegrations, and I feel like it was important —
Sylvi:         Trip is definitely looking for an excuse, you know?
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        Yeah. Yeah.
Art (as Trip):        I got this disintegrator gun.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Put that away!
Art (as Trip):        What?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        It's scary!
Art (as Trip):        I spent so much money on this!
Sylvi (as Wrench):        I — please stop pointing that at me and put it away.
Art:        [chuckling] Just gesturing with it like a —
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        [laughing]
Sylvi (as Wrench):        If you hit one of the cars, you're going to have to pay for it.
Art (as Trip):        Well, how are you going to know?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        The car won't be there.
Art (as Trip):        No body, no murder... is what they told me when I bought...
Austin:        [cracking up]
Sylvi (as Wrench):         Trip, you really worry me sometimes.
Ali (as Froggy):        When Ronny comes tomorrow and asks us what we found out, we can't say, “oh, they got hit by as bus.”
Sylvi (as Wrench):        I mean, we can. We just shouldn't.
Art (as Trip):         That's compelling, in a way, that...
Sylvi:         [laughing]
Art (as Trip):        [laughing] Some other things weren't.
Sylvi:        Oh my god. [laughing]
Austin:        [chuckling]
Sylvi:        We're not playing fiasco, is the thing.
Art:        Anything can be a fiasco if you try.
Sylvi:        But we do turn every game into that, so...
Austin:        [chuckles] So, what are you doing?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        So I think if we want to do something a little less intense than, uh, disinteraction —
Art (as Trip):        I don't.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Uh, I think we could tail them for a while, and see if we can sort of, have the opportunity to mess up their schedule if it arises, then maybe they'll slip, let something out, or — I don't know. This is how people get fucked up, is when you fuck with their schedule. Trust me, this happens to me all the time.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        I love the fuck up the schedule, uh, plan, that feels memorable and dynamic, you know?
Art:        Oh yeah, that's a great idea, love it.
Austin:        So...
Sylvi:        Okay.
Austin:        So you'll head over to the, the Pluperfect garage, which has to be like... I imagine there's like, all of the regular garages for the regular racers here, and then in a different building, there's building a takeover, or maybe the Pluperfects brought in their own modular garage to like, take up part of the, like an open area next to the track, you know? And they just kind of like, sky-dropped it in, and it like, unfolded itself, in a cyber way, you know? [chuckles] And, looking at it, there are definitely armed guards around it, in suits, nice suits. Uh, there are, uh, camera drones flying around. Uh, there's a big picture, there's a big holo picture of Absolute holding up the trophy, kind of being broadcast above it, that you can see from anywhere else in town if you look down from, you know, one of the walkways between the casinos, or if you're on the kind of like, elevated boardwalk, you can look down and see this, incredible picture of Pluperfect holding up the trophy with a huge grin, eyes hidden by sunglasses, of course. And to be clear, those armed guards aren't like, they're not going to shoot anybody who comes there, but they are there to like, tell you to not — in fact, maybe you [unintelligible] to communicate this, there are some fans, including one who's cosplaying as Absolute Pluperfect, like a little kid, like a teen, dressed as Absolute Pluperfect, including a wig with the bad dreads.
0:54:56.7        Uh, and they get turned away by these guards, who are like, “the racer appreciates your fandom and support. But, unfortunately, the hours for fan interaction have come and gone. Uh, if you'd like to, you can leave a message.” And the little kid is like, “I just, just let them know I want to grow up to be just like them.” And the guard is like [chuckling] — “we will do that.” And hands over a little, you know, sends over a little digital card, using, using their, the guard's like PDA, a little holocard that pops up. I just want to note that, when we first started recording this, I don't want to say, it was not pre-NFT boom, and I know this, because we were already talking shit about crypto by then, and shit about NFTs. Uh, notably because this game's money system is, I think it's called cryptos, and we're like, we're just not going to do that.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        But, I do think that we live in a world where, at this point in the game, it's not NFTs, but it's like, the market decided digital collectibles were big. And they, they — NFT, here's the thing I'm going to give us. The NFT got shut the fuck down as a thing that's like, on the blockchain, uh, but the digital collectible has, has absolutely blown up and stayed around. And so, this kid now has a, quote/unquote, a signed Absolute Pluperfect card, that has a little digital signature that gets like, drawn in, in sparkles in the hologram [chuckles], as, as they walk away with their, I believe their mom drove them here after the race, to try to meet Pluperfect, and by the time they got there, it was just too late.
0:56:52.8        Anyway, there are guards here. So... that's the situation. What do you do?
Sylvi:        I didn't think this far ahead. Uh... [laughing]
Austin:        I imagine this is like a two-story building, you know, got a couple are guards outside. Big garage doors that are closed, side door, side regular door that goes into an office, you know? Second floor is probably where Pluperfect is. Or basement, maybe there's a, there's probably not a basement if this was a modular building that was dropped from the sky and built itself. So maybe it's 3 floors, and the top floor is where Pluperfect is. What are our options, let's talk through our options —
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        Ali, go ahead.
Ali:        There — there are people around, there's fans and stuff, right? And is there like security?
Austin:        I think we're now post — yeah, yeah, there's security, there's people with guns, security guards.
Ali:        Oh, sure sure sure. [chuckles]
Austin:        But, no, the fans have — the bit I just did was talking about how there are no more fans, how the last fan was just shown away.
Ali:        Oh, sure sure sure, okay.
Austin:        So, no, it's like, it's dead at this point. We're really in, Pluperfect is inside somewhere, doing whatever their routine is. And we're nighttime mode now, you know?
Ali:        Oh, okay.
Austin:        Or after hours mode.
Sylvi:        We could...
Art:        We don't want to draw attention to ourselves, right? That's —
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Ali:        Well — mmm. [laughs] Let's say, let's say that Trip goes in there to be like, “after what happened today, I want to talk to you... I think we should sit down together.” And then... [laughing] Wrench and Froggy can, you know, do some sleuthing.
Sylvi:        I don't hate that.
Ali (as Froggy):        But, you know, it would require some lying on your part, Trip. It might be hard to swallow your pride.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Do you think you can pretend to be nice? Just to like, I mean, or like, or want to apologize, I guess.
Art (as Trip):        I mean, is it even believable?
Ali (as Froggy):        I mean, not to, maybe not apology — well, you may not — think of it this way, you're lying to, to, to get one up on this person. [laughing]
Art (as Trip):        All right.
Ali (as Froggy):        It's like an aggressive, it's like, you know, you're being nice, but it's like, mean.
Art (as Trip):        Yeah.
Austin:        [chuckles] I —
Art (as Trip):        I mean, I don't know, [unintelligible] eyes can get turned away like —
Austin:        One second. I just want to give you one more piece of, one more thing that is not written down here, which is, you have your chaos and theory rolls, which again, is how this works. So if you want to go lie to this person, you can explain to me if that's chaos or theory, we can talk through what that is.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        As a reminder, chaos is, I mean, chaos is chaos. I guess the book, does the book have a, like a real breakdown of which is — you know.
Sylvi:        Kind of just describes like, I think something I've seen is just that chaos is literally just more chaotic —
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Sylvi:        And the other one is more analytical, specifically?
Austin:        Yeah. I think that that's the whole of their breakdown on those, which is — I'd love a little bit more, but I get it, you know? Uh, uh, but there's also reputation. Uh, and what reputation is, is a thing that you can pull on, to get a little bit of a bonus. Quote, the way you perform on the track carries over to the way characters in Gravity Rip treat your racer the rest of the time. The reputation roll lets you use this to your advantage, regardless of how well your last race went.
1:00:36.5        When not in a race, you can attempt to leverage your racer's on-track reputation to boost your odds when you make a chaos or theory check. To do this, convince the GM that your reputation, performance in the most recent race, somehow impacts your current situation in a way that benefits you. If the GM agrees, when it comes to the check, roll two dice and take whichever result you like. So the example that they give is, uh, a character trying to intimidate someone. Uh, and the player notes that, uh, in the race that they just had, she slammed two, uh, racers. And so how that should add up to being, that reputation of being kind of able to, kind of put her money where her mouth is. And so in this case, I think, Trip, you can probably leverage the fact that you came in second place, the fact that you almost one, the fact that you threw that big temper tantrum.
1:01:26.3        There's stuff here that you can leverage, if you tell me how, to get a little extra bonus.
Art:        Sure, I mean, it's, it's conceivable. I mean, the lie is super conceivable.
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        Yeah. Based on the reputation.
Austin:        100 percent.
Art:        As long as you're not like, Absolute makes all of their security refuse to watch the races —
Austin:        [chuckles] No, I've not done that. Not until you fail. Uh, but no, the reputation is the reputation. I think the world of Gravity Rip has to be one in which every character we meet knows about the race, because that's the world we live in, you know?
Art:        Right, yeah.
Austin:        It's like Fast and the Furious, where like, for some reason, everyone cares about racing and cars, you know?
Art:        Well, probably because major world events keep being decided by —
Austin:        Yes. [laughing]
Art:        Car races.
Austin:        Yes, exactly. [laughing] Ugh. Never not think about the idle thumbs, or the, it's important if true bit. No, maybe it's idle thumbs, in which, in which they talk about how there's a line in Max Payne 3, where Max Payne complains that the news won't stop talking about about him. And he's [laughing] he's like, ugh, talk about something important for once. And they point out that like, if one person had killed as many people as Max Payne had, it would be the only news story [chuckling] ever on the TV.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:         Like, [laughing] you've killed 182 people in just this one game. Like, no one is going to shut up about you, dude. Anyway, we live in that world, but for cars.
Sylvi:        God.
Austin:        So anyway, what's it look like, Art? Give me, give me Trip opening up the opportunity for Froggy and, and Wrench to sneak in.
Art:        You know, it's going up to the guy and being like —
Austin (as Guard):        Woah woah woah.
Art (as Trip):        Hey. Hey. Is Absolute in.
Austin (as guard):        You're Trip Uncertainty.
Art (as Trip):        I sure am. How's it going?
Austin (as Guard):        Eh... smooth moves out there. [snorts derisively] second place. Pretty good.
Art (as Trip):         Yeah. Yeah, pretty good. Look, I feel... I feel bad about what happened there, at the end, and especially after, and I was just... you know, I was hoping maybe we could make some time and maybe clear the air a little bit. Me and Absolute. The racer.
Austin:        This feels, this feels like a, a theory to me, right? Or is this a — is it lying — is lying impulsive? Or is keeping cool analytical?
Art:        Uh, is lying inherently chaotic, is that the question you're asking me?
Austin:        I guess that's the question, right? Or do we want to differ between different types of lies? Like, you're not screaming and yelling in order to like, distract somebody. That to me is easy chaos, right?
Art:        Yeah. But that's a bad thing to do when you're doing something like this, because people remember that —
Austin:        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. I really wish this game had a little more guidance on what they thought was chaos. I guess there's examples. Uh, intimidation they put as chaos.
1:04:37.9        Uh... sneaking around, they put as theory.
Ali:        Mmm.
Austin:        You want to argue one way or the other, Art?
Art:        I mean, my argument is, my chaos is much higher than my theory.
Austin:        That's not a good argument.
Art:        No, but that does sort of feel like theory. But I mean, with two rolls, I can — what do I need to roll?
Austin:        Yeah, two rolls. You've got to roll above a 5. 5 or 6 here.
Sylvi:        Have to roll a 5 or a 6.
Austin:        If it's a 5, it's a critical success.
Art:        Uh, I mean, with two dice, it's not that bad.
Austin:        Yeah, totally. Let's see 'em. 2D6.
Art:        And if I fail, we'll see some chaos, I'll tell you that.
Austin:        Oh, we sure will, uh-huh.
Art:        I'm not going to go quietly.
Austin:        Oh, a 4 and a 1.
Art:        It tricked me!
Austin:        [laughing] You saw the 5 and thought —
Art:        Because I saw the 5.
Austin:        Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh... so, so you fail here, Art. Uh, I think —
Art:        Four plus one is five, if you're listening.
Austin:        Yeah, four plus one is five. So the number five showed up, but that's not what, what he got.
Austin (as guard):        I'm afraid, uh, you know, Pluperfect, uh, uh, needs the, the night to go through the routine, you know, classic, classic Absolute. Uh, so no, sorry, sir, you will not be seeing my boss. In fact, what you'll be doing is turning around and leaving immediately.
Art (as Trip):        Don't sir me.
Austin (as guard):        All right. Mister.
Art (as Trip):        That's the same.
Austin (as guard):        That's different. Mister and sir are different. What do you want? What do you want from me?
Art (as Trip):        I am a, I am a colleague. I am, you deserve the respect that you show —
Austin (as guard):        All right, then, colleague, turn around and go the other direction.
Art (as Trip):        We're not colleagues!
Austin (as guard):         Colleague Uncertainty. Oh, look at me, I'm Colleague Uncertainty here.
Art (as Trip):        That's not even what that means, you can't use that like that!
Austin (as guard):        Guys!
Austin:        And he like, taps on like an ear piece —
Austin (as guard):        We're going to need, uh, Colleague to be, uh, escorted off the premises. Can we get a little backup here front?
Art (as Trip):        Again, when you say it like that, it sounds like we're colleagues! We're not colleagues! I'm —
Austin (as guard):        You're right, you're a little bit below me in the scheme of things.
Art (as Trip):        Oh my god.
Sylvi:        Damn!
Art (as Trip):        Oh, oh, you better, you better watch yourself.
Austin:        [chuckling] A few other guards are coming out this way. Froggy and, and Wrench, what are y'all up to, watching this happen?
Sylvi:        Can we, like, use the commotion to get in?
Austin:        I mean, maybe, right? In a weird way, this has gone bad for, for Trip. I mean, Trip, you've definitely been noticed, right? I think the consequence here is, is security is up, right? The alert is up. But you did, you know, there is, some of these guards have moved away from another angle, right? Maybe they've stopped guarding a fence or something that now Froggy and Wrench can try to hop over. Uh, which one of y'all wants to do that?
Sylvi:        How analytical is hopping over a fence?
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Hoo... great question.
Sylvi:        Because I thought — but, Froggy, go ahead?
Ali:        You know, I think hopping a fence is pretty chaotic. I think, you know.
Austin:        I think so. Yeah, Froggy, do you want to roll it then?
Ali:        Key cards are very theory, keys are very theory.
Austin:        Key cards are theory, yeah. Hopping a fence is chaos. You agree with this.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        I'll be, I'll be here for any key card related things.
Ali:        [wheezes]
Austin:        Yeah. Well, maybe it's both, right? Like maybe it's going to be the, go, go, go, Froggy has to hop over, has to help you hop over, and then, type type type, you have to hack in. You have to hack the key card.
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Austin:        Let's do both of those. So Froggy, give me your, your chaos here. Do you want to —
Ali:        So I'm rolling —
Austin:        You want a low, you want a, you want an under — no, sorry. Yeah, that's right. You want under a 4 here. 4 or under.
Ali:        So I'm rolling 2D6?
Austin:        You're rolling — no, because you're not using your reputation, right? This is just saw 1D6, this is Lasers and Feelings.
Ali:        Yeah. Well...
Austin:        Hey, it's a 4. That's a critical success.
Ali:        Woah!
Austin:        So what happens, what's the crit part of this? What's the bonus?
Sylvi:         Clears the fence in one leap.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Yeah, but like, maybe we don't need that second roll, then, if it's a crit, right?
Ali:        Maybe it's like... because, when you had described the, the guards walking away, I was thinking like, we could walk down the hallway the guards came from to see if there's like —
Austin:        Oh.
Ali:        A security room or something.
Austin:        Or like, you just like, they come out the side of the building, and you do it so quick that you're able to stop the door from closing behind them, so that you can get in.
Ali:        Ooh, yeah.
Austin:        You know what I mean? You're like, I got my foot in. That way I don't have to hack the door.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        So yeah, boom. Door is open, you're in. This place is pristine. This place is like, white — it's like the floors are, have lights under them. They're glowing white with like, black grid outlines, you know? It's one of those weird situations. The whole hallway is pristine and chrome and glowing. And it's a little overwhelming, and also like, a little gauche, you know? It's like, ugh, this is so fancy in this very particular Sci-Fi way. You feel like you're in, like a fake spaceship, you know? Uh, uh, and the way it basically works out is level 1, floor 1 is the garage itself. Floor 2 is like, uh, support staff, uh, planning, strategizing, you know, your research and development. And then floor 3 is, is Pluperfect's quarters, which is probably where the thing you're looking for is. What do y'all do here?
1:09:58.8        
Ali:        Is there a way that we can text trip to be like, meet us by this other entrance? So the party isn't split for like, the rest of the session? [laughing]
Austin:        I mean, you can, yeah, you can, you can send that info in. Maybe, do you find like, another, another back door that you can kind of leave open, or —
Ali:        Right, yeah. Trip like, dramatically is like, “well, I'm leaving.” [laughing]
Austin:        Right, right.
Art:        Yeah.
Ali:        Just goes around to the other side of the building.
Austin:        Yeah, let's do that. Trip, Trip, let's, let's see what that is. I think, you know, you have three guards now. At least one of them is resting their hand on, on their gun, you know, in their holster, which is a very bad idea, just generally speaking. Uh, and they're like, you know —
Austin (as guard):        All right, you don't want to be called colleague, you don't want to be Mister, Sir... peer, what do you, what do you — racer? Racer, racer.
Art (as Trip):        Racer's fine. Racer is fine. You — yeah, say Racer and I'll, then I'll leave.
Austin (as guard):         Racer Uncertainty, I'd like to you leave. If you don't leave —
Art (as Trip):         Thank you.
Austin (as guard):        We'll have to take action.
Art (as Trip):        Thank you, I'm leaving. I'm already gone. I'm going.
Austin (as guard):        Keep an eye on that one, okay? And, you know, one of the hover drones kind of like, you hear it go [drone noises] and it like, lifts up into the air, as if to try to keep an eye on you. So you're going to have to shake it if you're going to get into the side, the side entrance that's been left open for you.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        What's that, what's that look like?
Art:         Pfff. I don't know. Uh, just sort of like, it has to have a range, right? Is it just like, sort of like, walking, trying to like, walk it out?
Austin:        Maybe, yeah. I mean, you tell me. You can make up whatever you want to do here.
Art:        Like going out and trying to, trying to come back. Like watching it, dipping behind, seeing if I can like —
Austin:        Juke it?
Art:        Yeah, shake it like a, you know, going under something that it won't go under.
Austin:        Yeah, yeah, sure. This is your racetrack, right? You race here. Uh —
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        Pluperfect's crew is visiting, so you know all the ins and outs, all the little secret cutbacks this sounds like chaos.
Art:        Yeah, finally. But it does not sound like I can use my, uh...
Austin:        [chuckling] No. No.
Art:         Reputation on it.
Austin:        Uh-uh.
Art:        So it's 1D6.
Austin:        Hey, there's a success. That's a success.
Art:        There's a success.
Austin:        3, so, yeah, manage to sneak back in. Uh, uh, at this point, I mean, you sneak in to the, back to the compound, you hop a fence, you get into the door that's been left open for you, and meet up with your crew. Uh, uh, you can hear that people are coming back, some of the guards are coming back inside. You can also hear the work that's being done on Pluperfect's impeccable car. Which, I want to say, I compared to, to Darth Maul's spaceship.
Sylvi:        [laughing] That sounds like something you'd do.
Austin:        It does. It's called the Absolute Class, and so their car is being, is being, you know, maintained. You can hear the sounds of the like, you know, the sounds that car tools make. You know, that like, really rapid [broink broink], you know, of the motorized electric wrenches or whatever they use? All of that's happening, sounds cool. [chuckles] Uh, but yeah, you're here. First floor. First floor is the garage, the second floor is administration, third floor is Pluperfect's personal quarters. Uh, you would guess that that is all locked up. What do you do?
1:13:29.1        I believe in your power to break and enter. What I'll say is, if you stay still for too long, those guards are going to circle back around, and one of them's going to see you in here. Because it's really bright, this is not a place you can just like, hide in the hallway forever.
Sylvi:        Yeah, I feel like we need to find a computer, right?
Austin:         Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Sylvi:        Like, that's what here for, is the file. Jackpotsupreme.zip.
Austin:        Jackpot, that's right.
Sylvi:        I almost said jackpotsupreme.mp3. Jack, name the music that.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        That's so funny.
Sylvi:        [laughing] Uh, so, yeah. Uh, I don't know if we'd need to go, like, I feel like, is there one down here? This feels like it's only the garage level.
Austin:        Probably not. I mean, specifically, you know that the file should only exist on Pluperfect's personal —
Sylvi:        Okay.
Austin:         Palm Pilot. Uh, uh, but you might be able to get something else from the computers, you know what I mean?
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        You might be able to grab some other information, you might be able to find something else. So I'm not going to say you can't roll — if you want to roll for a thing, you can roll for a thing, you know? So you're sneaking around, you sneak up to that second floor. I think you can probably find some sort of, there's like a coaching room, there's like a —
Sylvi:        Oh my god.
Austin:        At this point, at this point, Pluperfect is out of the tape watching, and is into the, having a — it's an ice bath, but then also you put mayonnaise in it. Uh, that stage of the, of the cool down routine. So the tape, the tape room, the tape and coaching room, there's a big whiteboard. Uh, that has a computer, with all of the video tape of, of, not video tape, but, you know. MP4 files, holo MP4 files, of the race. But probably also has a bump of other company data and stuff on it. So if you want to hack into that, you might be able to get something.
Sylvi:        Okay, I'll give it a shot, then. It could at the very least give us some ideas of what their schedule's like, what, like —
Austin:        Totally. Totally.
Sylvi:        What's next in their routine...
Austin:        Oh yeah. Go for it. Give me, give me your analysis, or your theory roll. You need a 2 or above. 1D6.
Sylvi:        Okay.
Austin:        Hey, that's a 2! That's a critical success. Uh, [beep-beep, beep-beep beep-beep, boop boop boop, beep] that's hacking sounds.
Ali:        Sure.
Austin:        [boop boop boop doop] Uh... uh-huh.
Ali:        [boop boop boop]
Sylvi:         Wrench is also making the noises with her mouth as well, a little bit.
Austin:        Yeah, thank you, I appreciate it. Thanks for taking some of that off of my shoulders.
Sylvi:        Yeah, no worries. No, Wrench is literally, in character, like in character —
Austin:        Oh — [cracking up]
Sylvi:        Is going, beep-beep boop boop, a little bit while she's doing it, just like, under her breath. She does this every time she uses a computer.
Austin:        Perfect.
Art:        That makes it work better, too.
Austin:        It does, yeah, I love it. Uh, you see, uh, I mean, you see the information about that file that's been passed around. You see a new version of it was downloaded just today. But on that crit, the thing you notice that's especially good is that, from this computer, you do have access to, not only Pluperfect's schedule, which, again, shows that there's the ice mayonnaise bath happening right now, but also, that you can change the bath components. It's all computerized. And so like, you could turn on the whirlpool in there, the water jets in there. You could add a different, you know, essential oil or condiment to the mix.
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        I know what you're thinking — how could an android take a bath without getting all electric shocked. And I said that they were a biodroid, a bioandroid. So it's all, you know, it's a mix of mechanical and organic parts, and in such a way that's fine. It's, it's okay. They're allowed.
Sylvi:        All right, so what type of sauce do we want to make this bath into? What sort of aioli are we the mood for? I'm sorry.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        It's extremely gross, you know?
Sylvi:        It is extremely goes.
Austin:        I, I thought of the grossest thing I could think of.
Sylvi:        You know what?
Art:        Can we just give this guy a, a normal bath? Teach them what water's like? You can bathe in just water.
Austin:        You're going to remove the extra? That's — you know?
Art:        Remove the stuff.
Austin:        Yeah.
Sylvi:        If we do sour cream, they might think it was the Tigers. I'm just saying.
Austin:        [chuckles]
Sylvi:        I'm just saying, it's an option.
Art:        That's clever.
Ali:        Ooh...
Sylvi:        I never get to prank anybody, I'm really excited.
Ali:        Ooh, yeah, a little, a little... I don't know what you call that. [giggling]
Art:        I like the sour cream idea a lot.
Austin:        Misdirection. False flag.
Ali:        Misdirection.
Sylvi:        Because they'll think it's mayonnaise for a little bit, and then they'll smell it and be like, wait a minute, this isn't mayonnaise. You know.
Austin:        So do you do it? So do you hit the sour cream button?
Sylvi:        I'm hitting the sour cream button.
Ali:        Nasty.
Sylvi:        And maybe [unintelligible] a little ketchup, too.
Art:        Why do they even have that button?
Austin:        Other people might want it. Maybe there's a different day of the week, where they choose to have the sour cream bath instead. You know?
Sylvi:        See, I'm just assuming this is like a Coke Freestyle machine that attaches to a bunch of different shit.
Austin:        It is. Yeah, exactly.
Sylvi:        So it's not just the bath.
Austin:        It's not just the bath, exactly.
Ali:        Oh, so in the basement, there's like a sour cream box —
Austin:        Yes. Yes.
Ali:        And it goes to the — it connects to the bathtub, and also to the kitchen?
Austin:        It connects to everything, yeah. I know what you're thinking. Does that mean that there's a shampoo box down there that also goes to the kitchen? And the answer is yes.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        100 percent.
Ali:        Ugh.
Sylvi:        The kitchen — the basement is just full of boxes of things.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Also, we established there wasn't a basement, so instead what it is is, there are hookups. They've landed their modular —
Ali:        Oh yeah.
Austin:        The, the racetrack just has a mayonnaise supply underneath the racetrack, underneath the, you know what I mean?
Sylvi:        This is supposed to go to the concession stand.
Art:        Sure.
Austin:        Exactly. Yes.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Exactly. Uh, uh, and, and so yeah. Uh, there's a beat. There's a beat. And then you hear a door slam open, and Pluperfect, in a bathrobe, stomps down the stairs, and yells, “who put sour cream in my bath?” And now you have a moment to maybe, maybe, uh, make a maneuver upstairs. Leaving the, you know, they left the, the door to their, their penthouse open.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        You can hear them stomp down the hallway and begin to go further downstairs. You know, a little window of opportunity here.
Sylvi:        Ugh. I bet they smell terrible.
Austin:        Oh, they smell so bad. They were already going to smell bad.
Sylvi:        I already don't like sour cream. But like, that quantity.
Austin:        Yeah, me too. Bleh.
Sylvi:        I'm not fucking here for it.
Ali:        Smells better than the mayonnaise. [laughing] Sorry.
Sylvi:        Yeah, I guess. I guess got to be honest, I don't really smell mayonnaise that often, either.
Ali:        Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not around either very much.
Austin:        Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Ali:         Uh, yeah. I mean, we got, we got a — you know, hard work is paying off, and we got to get upstairs.
Austin:        All right. So you rush upstairs —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Finding the Penthouse suite here. It is very similar to the rest of the place, in a sense that it is, uh, like, too bright to look at. Everything is glowing. Everything has this kind of luminous vibe, except for one wall, which is filled with old, you know, Atlantic City and Bluff City memorabilia, including photos of the old boardwalk, a model of the old Summer's Wheel. There's absolutely a model of the balloon, that Luce had in our previous, the last arc. They're just such a fanboy for, they're such a fan of that era of, of the kind of Atlantic City and Bluff City experience, which is mostly false nostalgia, you know? They don't know how much trouble those kids got into, they just know that like, everyone talked a big game about life being better, you know? Back then. So, there's like ancient piece of salt water taffy that's like 300 years old or whatever. Very gross. 200 years old, probably.
1:21:10.8        
Ali (as Froggy):        You dare me to eat this? Hey, hey, y'all dare me to eat this?
Austin:        Oh my god.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Yeah, I'll give you 10 bucks.
Ali (as Froggy):        10 dollars? This could be poisonous. This could be nuclear!
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Yeah. It's all I have on me.
Ali (as Froggy):        Hm...
Austin:        [laughing] That's not true at all. You have 4300 dollars —
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        I didn't bring it with me!
Austin:        That's fair, that's —
Ali:        Should we do a flavor roll? Do we have a list of flavors?
Austin:        Oh, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Big list of flavors. You want minimum 100s, like I want the most — okay, okay.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Uh, one second, I've got to open it up in a spreadsheet.
Sylvi:        Hundreds...
Austin:        Gimme your, your roll. Gimme a D, let's see, opening up a new sheet, new Google sheet, dropping these flavors in. Uh, uh, it didn't, this didn't go the way I hoped.
Ali:        You were hoping that it would be like —
Austin:        All right, this works, this works, this works. This is a nightmare. Give me a D... 1000.
Ali:        I will do that, I will be glad.
Austin:        It's not 1000, but it's, it's more than you think it might be.
Ali:        [laughing] I have rolled 350.
Austin:        350.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        All right. Going up there, 350. Uh... all right. Now give me... [chuckling] give me a D2, because there's one at 349 and there's one at 351. All right, you got... [laughing] something called, energy rock.
Ali:        Woah! I told you this could be [cackling] wow.
Austin:        Energy rock flavored liquid concentrate. This is from oohflavors.com.
Ali:        Yeah, how did we both get here?
Sylvi:        I was wondering if this was from oohflavors. I was also looking at oohflavors.
Austin:        Uh, what is it? What's the flavor?
Ali:        Energy rock. More details.
Austin:        I want to know what energy rock is. Oh, okay. Tart, refreshing and rejuvenating, this unique flavor of an energy drink is enough to keep you going. It tastes like a Red Bull.
Art:        Eugh...
Ali:        That's disgusting.
Austin:        You're eating a Red Bull...
Sylvi:        Monster taffy.
Austin:        Salt taffy, salt water taffy.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        Does it have the Red Bull logo on it?
Austin:        It has to, right? This is where they got their flavor, actually. This was the original [chuckling] people don't know this, but in ancient, in the year 1900, in Atlantic City, someone made an experimental caffeine, or taurine salt water taffy. And the Red Bull corporation would one day steal it, and copy the taste profile. [chuckling]
Sylvi:        Yeah, same people who made carbonated mayonnaise.
Austin:        [laughing] Yeah. We know it came out, yes, it was a collab between those sisters and the taffy shop, the salt water taffy shop.
Ali (as Froggy):        This is nasty.
Ali:         Froggy is eating this and is like, what? Or —
Austin:        Or?
Art:        Or?
Ali:         Or... so far future that everything tastes like this.
Austin:        Uh-huh!
Ali:        It's like, wow, I, yeah. I guess we were eating the same stuff all back then.
Austin:        People's people, you know?
Ali:        [unintelligible] people, that was kind of boring.
Sylvi:        I don't want to live in a future where everything tastes like an energy drink, and I like energy drinks.
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        Yeah, absolutely, that sounds horrible.
Ali:        [snorts]
Austin:        Ugh... so, do you continue looking through their stuff? What do you do here? There's trophies here, there's a little model train. There's a TV that's playing the, the interview with... you're on the TV right now, Trip. Your tantrum is being covered by ESPN. They're saying very mean things about you. They're saying like, it's behavior like this that always kept you back, you know.
1:25:12.5        
Art:        It's not someone? They don't have like, someone on the other side, there's not like —
Ali:        Ooh.
Austin:        What do you mean?
Art:        Well, because that's like —
Sylvi:        Is Steven A defending you?
Austin:        Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Is there a Steven A defending you? No.
Ali:        [gasps]
Austin:        They, like, they put their, they say in the sort of like, “you know, I know we always go at it here, I know the people like to see us go at it. Uh, but, in this particular case, I got to tell you, I think you're right about this one, you know? I could try to mount an offense — uh, a defense. I could try to apologize for who Trip is, but I'm just not going to do it. I'm not going to stake my reputation on, uh, uh, Trip uncertainty's name, you know? The career is over, the season is over, uh, uh, and, and we saw what Trip is good for here, and it's producing adequate drama in a race, and then not winning it. And that's, it is what it is, isn't it? So...”
Art:        We'll see, we're going to see what happens when they want an interview, ever.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Good news, they don't. [chuckles] I guess they will in 10 years.
Art:        Well, in the future, yeah.
Austin:        Yeah, in the future when they're doing the profile, the, the uh, — what is it?
Art:        10 years? I'm going to win the next race!
Austin:        I'm thinking more about your 30 for 30 episode, you know what I mean?
Art:        Oh, no, they can cancel that, [unintelligible]
Austin:        Your 130 for 130, you know? It's 100 years from now. So, yeah. Uh, the PDA has been left on a little bedside table. It's charging, it's floating in some sort of hover charge station. But it could, I don't know, do you trust that you can just grab it? I don't know. Are you going to try to find, find the file on there?
Sylvi:        I mean, I could try taking a look at it.
Austin:        Give me a... how are you doing it? What's your, what's your plan?
Sylvi:        Well, like, there's no computer up here either, right? Because I figured I'd just connect it to a computer so it's easier.
Austin:        I bet there isn't. I bet there isn't.
Ali:         Ooh, we should steal it and text people on their phone all night.
Austin:        Oh my god.
Sylvi:        That's a terrible idea. I've got the prank bug, now. I've done one, and now I can't stop.
Austin:        You could [chuckling] you could text ESPN. You know that there's like a reporter that they leak stuff to, you know what I mean?
Ali:        [gasps]
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        That's chaos, this is big chaos.
Art:        Say, “I cheated.”
Austin:        Right.
Art:         “ Trip is the best.”
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali:        I have to get this off my chest. I'm watching our covers tonight, and it does, I just... I've, I'm riddled with guilt...
Austin:        Ugh...
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        I can't believe you're going to do this.
Art:         Trip is the better racer, I'm a cheater.
Sylvi:        And I smell like sour cream.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        All right. Give me a chaos roll.
Art:        Who?
Austin:        Whoever's doing the texting.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Interfacing with this, with this phone.
Sylvi:        I did not write any of that, so I'm [unintelligible]
Ali:        I have a four text, I can do, I can do this one on Trip's behalf.
Art:        I have, I have a, I have a 5...
Ali:        Oh, do you want to do it instead?
Art:        I mean, it seems kind of gauche for me —
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        But it's [unintelligible] better chance.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        You also did list out everything you wanted to say, just a second ago.
Austin:        Yeah, you did.
Sylvi:        Is the like, counterargument.
Austin:        But, it is funny to imagine Trip saying it out loud, “yeah, yeah, yeah, and say this, and say this.”
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Ali:         [cackling]
Art:        Oh, I think it's also funny if like, Trip is just like, talking about it, like a hypothetical —
Austin:        Right.
Art:        And then Froggy's like, “it's done.”
Austin:        Yeah.
Sylvi:        Can Froggy get a bonus for this, for Trip dictating? [chuckling]
Austin:        I think Froggy can get, I think, I think you should all get a radical bonus for doing this. You'll get a radical point —
Sylvi:        Okay, sick.
Austin:        For putting yourself at risk, that's what I'll give you. Now, if you want to spend a radical point, you can do that, I think you can do that in, in rolls, besides on the court, or the track of the court. Uh, is that true? You can only do that... let's see. I'm going to say you can do that anywhere. You could always, you can always do a radical bonus after you've rolled, in order to reroll a thing. So, everybody gets a radical bonus. Go ahead and give me your chaos roll on this, 1D6.
Ali:        Uh, I have spent all of this time adding this next to my sheet, but because I have 2, I might just use it now.
Austin:        You can use it after you roll. So if you don't need to —
Ali:        Sure, sure, sure. Okay, yeah. And this is a roll —
Sylvi:        It's not like, uh, Forged in the Dark where you have to declare ahead of time?
Austin:        Yes, exactly. So you're trying to go, 4 or under, if it's chaos, right? Yeah.
Ali:        Would you say the... people who have come up into racing through — well, no, I'm not shit-talking, never mind. I'm trying to text this person like, fake professionally. I was about to be like, I'm a street racer so I can shit-talk people better than others. But that's not what I'm doing right now.
Austin:        Mmm, and that's not how the reputation thing works. It's not literally, do you have experience — it's, does someone who knows your reputation, is there someone who knows your reputation involved specifically, yeah.
Ali:        Oh, sure sure sure. Okay.
Austin:        I believe that that's true.
Ali:        That's a 3, I wanted under a 4, right?
Austin:        That's a success. Yeah, that's a success.
Ali:        Okay. Yay!
Austin:        Uh, what's the live fallout from this?
Art:        Do you think it takes him a little bit? Do you think, like, this is sort of happening —
Austin:        Yeah, maybe it'll, maybe as you leave, it'll, it'll filter through, right? Uh, I mean, I actually — [chuckling] the thing that happens, as you're now going through the phone, because you're trying to find this file still, right? I think that's going to be an analytical roll no matter what, a theory roll no matter what, trying to find a file hidden on a phone. Uh, but as that's happening, the phone starts blowing up, as people are trying to get in touch, from ESPN, with Absolute Pluperfect to confirm these reports, you know? So you just immediately cancel calls, you know what I mean? As they're, they're calling in, as you're trying to find this file now.
Ali:        Can we just turn the phone off and sneak out?
Austin:        You're just going to take the phone?
Ali:        Why not?
Austin:        Okay. I mean, then they know that the phone got taken — I mean, at this point, I guess there's no question that someone —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Was just fucking with the phone, so I guess so. You want to, you want to steal the phone?
Ali:        I just feel like we'll have more time for investigation...
Austin:        Yeah, yeah, totally.
Sylvi:        We can just give it to that guy.
Austin:        Yeah, true. True.
Ali:        This is, where, the, where, this is a time-sensitive situation in this room right now. So we should...
Austin:        All right. Well then let's get, I need a roll from one of y'all to get out of here safely, then. What's that look like? Is this a mad dash out of the building, is this a sneaky, you know, checking your corners, tiptoeing your way through?
Sylvi:        I wonder if it's waiting.
Art:        That sounds like it makes more sense.
Sylvi:        Yeah, I was going to say, we could use the sound of the garage, like when things get particularly noisy —
Austin:        Mmm, sure.
Sylvi:        To like cover our tracks a bit.
Ali:        Ooh.
Austin:        That's good. All right, give me a theory roll. Wrench, it sounds like you're taking a lead here.
Sylvi:        Sure. I got a 5.
Austin:        You got a 5, that's a success. You're looking to get over a 2.
Sylvi:        Every time I roll this game I forget what the numbers do.
Austin:        You know, I also —
Ali:        [chuckling]
Sylvi:        It's always just fun to find out with everybody else [unintelligible]
Austin:        Yes. Uh, so then, yeah, you pocket the phone, you head downstairs, timing it with the big clunks of the, of the, you know, car being raised and lowered or whatever. Uh, uh, the, you know, you duck into a little side room, you hear Pluperfect going back upstairs to rinse off all of the sour cream. And by the time you're dipping out of the building, you hear Pluperfect yell once more as, on the television, it comes through that, that they've gotten a message from Pluperfect directly, that has been, uh, it has been, it's not been confirmed by Pluperfect's people, but it does say that Pluperfect's manager says, whatever Pluperfect sent you, that's the absolute truth. And so —
Ali:        Oh...
Austin:        And it's just like, that's the default. That's what their manager has been told to tell people.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        And it has backfired, big time.
Ali:        Does the like, title underneath the ESPN guy say — Pluperfect: Absolute Cheater?
Austin:        [laughing] It does, 100 percent.
Sylvi:        Oh my god.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Ugh. And you get back to your, to your, uh, garage. You doing anything else tonight before, before, uh, getting out of here?
Sylvi:        Uh, [chuckles] I kind of want to like, fix up our cars.
Austin:        That's a good idea.
Ali:        [laughing] Oh, sure.
Austin:        I agree with this. So, it costs one volt point per integrity to heal up. Uh, as a reminder, let's go through these numbers really quick, uh, your max integrity, Trip, is 7. So it's going to cost you 6 volt to repair. Your max integrity, Froggy — I mean, you can repair less than that if you'd like to, but that seams silly to me. Uh, uh, Froggy, yours is 8, so you need to spend 2 volt, uh, 2 volts. And Wrench, yours is 10, so you also need to spend 2 volts.
Sylvi:        Okay. I'm going to do that.
Ali:        Oh, wait, it's 8 plus 0, and then —
Austin:        Yeah, exactly, exactly. Uh... what's it look like when you repair your, what do the repairs look like?
Sylvi:        Very anxiously trying to buff out the dents from when I, uh, caused a massive pile up. Just like, incredibly guilt-ridden while I do that.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Sylvi:        And it's kind of unclear whether she's guilt-ridden because the car got damaged, or whether people got hurt.
Austin:        Yeah...
Sylvi:        But she's apologizing a lot, and it seems to be directed at the car.
Austin:        Yeah, fair.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        I won't let this happen again. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Austin:        [beep boop boo] We established that your car beeps at you.
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Ali:        Mmm.
Austin:        So. [boop boop boo?]
Sylvi:        I hug my car.
Austin:        [boop boop boo] All right.
Sylvi:        I'm assuming I'm also helping the others with fixing their stuff?
Austin:        I have — you're the, you're the mechanical, right?
Sylvi:        I — yeah.
Austin:        Yeah, that makes sense.
Ali:        Yeah, I'd love the assist if — I guess there's not assists in this game.
Sylvi:        I just mean like fictionally, like [unintelligible] I don't want to spend my stuff.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Sylvi:        I don't know when I'm going to need it.
Austin:        Yeah, that makes sense.
Ali:        So we're spending, we're spending volts for this. 1 for 1 for points?
Austin:        Yep, that's 1 for 1, got it.
Ali:        Okay. So I'm going from —
Sylvi:        I don't think this is going to be a thing, but if you, like right now, but if you don't have enough, you can convert your — are we calling them crits?
Austin:        We're calling them crits, that's fine, yeah.
Sylvi:        You can convert 1,000 of those to one volt.
Austin:        There you go.
Ali:        Ooh. Well, I'm going from 11 volts to 9 volts, to get my integrity from a 6 to an 8.
Austin:        Okay.
Art:        I'm going from 14 to 8, to go from 1 to 7.
Austin:        [laughing] Okay.
Ali:        Yowza.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Ali:        It's a tough race for you.
Austin:        It was.
Art:        It's hard at the top.
Sylvi:        There's a lot of, because it's not all the way there, I image there's still some things wrong with it, so there's a lot of Wrench being like, “you sure, you sure? Like you sure this isn't a problem?
Austin:        I mean, I should —
Sylvi:        I'll stop if you tell me to, but are you sure?
Austin:        I will note, you can, uh, upgrade your machine, if you prefer, or would like to spend your points that way.
Art:        Love to get above a 7.
Austin:        Sure, totally. So, during story mode, if you wish, you can seek out mechanics and merchants who are able to repair and modify your machine. Uh, uh, da-da-da, we did the repairs already. Upgrading generally costs 15 volts, but a small amount of leeway. You may bring down the cost with clever haggling, or the promise of a favor. Conversely, the price might be higher if the seller doesn't trust you, or, believes you to be desperate. I'm going to say, an upgrade costs 12, instead of costing 15, because you don't have to pay for labor, because Wrench is on the team as your mechanic. I mean, Wrench, you should take a paycheck from the team. Do you know what I mean? Wrench is paid, but just from the team, but you're not paying extra, you know? Uh, so that, that is, uh, what did I just say? 13, or 12? 12, 12 volts to upgrade by 1.
Art:        Oh my god.
Austin:        You can spend 5 volts to move a point, but also, as a reminder, you can buy a volt for 2,000 credits.
Sylvi:        Oh, I'm... I might... burn all this stuff.
Austin:        You could, you know, you do borrow from each other, you could... yeah, that's the other thing, is, Wrench, you might actually, you literally.
Sylvi:        I have exactly enough.
Austin:        Wait, no, no you don't, no you don't. Because you have 8 left, right?
Sylvi:        And then I have 4,000. Oh, no, it's 2,000 for —
Austin:        But it costs 2,000 for —
Sylvi:        I thought it was 1,000 per —
Austin:        No, it's 2,000 per.
Sylvi:        Damn.
Austin:        So you're close, but, you're all very close, but, you're supposed to get paid tomorrow. What did I say, 15,000?
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        So that's, that's — 5,000 each.
Art:        Yeah, so we'll take that money, we'll put it in the cars, yeah.
Austin:        Yeah.
Ali:        Plus the follow up job.
Austin:        Plus the follow up job. Mm-hm. So, do we want to jump to tomorrow?
Sylvi:        Yeah, I can't think of anything else that needs to be done.
Austin:        Uh, you get a, I think one of you gets a text that night. Uh, it's probably Wrench. I think it just says, it's, it's from Ronny, and it says, “was that y'all?” Question mark, question mark, question mark.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        And then, in parentheses, with a smaller font, as if it's whispering, as if he's whispering, “ESPN?”
Ali:        [wheezes]
Austin:        In the future, you can change your font in your text messages.
Ali:        Wow...
Austin:        Yeah.
Sylvi:        There is, like, ugh, I'm trying to figure out the thing I want to — I, in my head Wrench just sends back like an Oopsie! Like, LINE sticker type thing.
Ali:        [giggling]
Sylvi:        But there's like this very specific one that I'm thinking of, and then there's like a tweet, where it's like, when you get caught, when you get indicted by the International War Crimes [unintelligible]
Austin:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        And she's got, like, she's got like both hands on her head and her tongue sticking out.
Austin:        Uh, when you send that —
Sylvi:        If I find, it's on my phone somewhere, I'll find it.
Austin:        Uh, when you send that, you get an automated, uh, response, that's, uh, that is more lyrics from “Chatahootchie” by Alan Jackson. It says, it probably says, uh, I'm looking at the lyrics to this song. Sorry, I prompt Dre — when I asked Dre's permission to play Ronny as a member of Hector Hu's secret organization, Blossom Investigations, Dre said, “just make sure to talk about Chatahootchie, that's in my rider.” And I didn't check Dre's contract —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        But I'm imagining that's true. So I'm trying my best to make up for it. Uh, by quoting Chatahootchie as much as I can. And it says, uh, “well, way down yonder on the Chatahootchie, it gets a-hotter than a hootchie-cootchie. We laid lubber on the Georgie asphalt, we got a little crazy, but we never got caught.” And then, it says, underneath that, it says, “I'm out, getting a little crazy but never getting caught. Leave your message.” Because in the future, also, texts have away messages. We brought away messages back in the future.
Art:        Great choice.
Austin:        Uh, and then you get a text from him after, he's like, whoops, I have my away message on. Sorry, lol.
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:         Tongue sticking out, winky face, you know?
Sylvi:        [chuckles] I send a thumbs-up LINE sticker.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Sylvi:        I think Wrench just texts with line stickers.
Austin:        Uh-huh, great.
Sylvi:        Because I put, I put it in the Bluff City Discord.
Austin:        Oh, good, you have one. Good, I love it. Thank you so much. Perfect, yeah, ideal. Uh, what's the sound, there's a great sound that she makes when she does this.
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:        Like “neeeh” it's like a “neeeeeh” I can't do it.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        I can't do it, I don't have the, I don't have it. What is it? It's like, “ehhhh,”it's one of those.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        Sound she makes in the anime [chuckling] when she puts her head on her hands.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        Anyway. Next day. Do you meet him out at the old airfield, or do you meet him at his suggestion for breakfast, which is [chuckling] one of the casino buffets.
Ali:        It's free breakfast?
Austin:        Free breakfast, he's paying.
Sylvi:        Okay.
Ali:        Uh, yeah. I'm not eating breakfast and going to this guy's office.
Austin:        Yeah, fair.
Art:        Again, we're not seeing him in the sunlight, I'm just saying.
Austin:         [laughing] That is, that is why I did pick this. Because it extends the ambiguity about whether he's a vampire or not. It's very funny to me.
Ali:        Wait, because he would have stayed at the casino all night?
Austin:        Or maybe, I don't know, maybe he has some sort of special car with blacked out windows. I don't know, maybe he gets a ride.
Ali:        Eh...
Austin:        We don't know. We don't know how vampires work in this world.
Ali:        Oh, it's not an outdoor meetup. Okay.
Austin:        No, this is, this would then be an indoor casino buffet. When you're in a casino, they don't want you to ever see the sky. [chuckles]
Ali:         No, no, no, no, yeah.
Sylvi:        [laughing] Oh my god.
Austin (as Ronny):        Ugh, you guys got up to a lot of, a lot of stuff last night, it seems. I don't want to be too loud, but...
Art (as Trip):        I don't know what you're talking about, I came to talk to Absolute, and it didn't, it didn't work out as — their security was rude as shit, to be honest.
Austin (as Ronny):        Yeah, you know I —
Art (as Trip):        I retired to the garage to do some work.
Austin (as Ronny):        Uh, Absolute's people put out, I don't know if you saw it this morning, they said, they tried to put it on you and say that you, that you did it. But the, uh, journalists pointed out, in the footage, it shows you walking away. It shows you going and having a conversation, and then you walked away. So it couldn't be you. So, uh, whoever did it... I don't know.
Art (as Trip):        A horrible crime, if, if — if it's not a real text message, and we'll never know —
Austin (as Ronny):        Right.
Art (as Trip):        If that was just a moment of guilt, but —
Austin (as Ronny):        Because of how they're a big cheater.
Art (as Trip):         Yeah.
Austin (as Ronny):        Anyway, so, uh, god, what, what would you like — you know, I'm going to go up and get some French toast sticks, a little bit of bacon. I'm going to get myself a nice big cup of coffee, a little bit of Joe, you know. I can't, I can't get up in the morning without my juice. Uh, what else do I want for breakfast? Some eggs, probably. Scrambled, scramble 'em up. Mmm. Does anyone want anything else from the buffet, before we talk business? They have the ice cream machine up and running. It's morning, so you shouldn't do it, but I've got to tell you, a waffle with a little ice cream... not so bad.
Art (as Trip):        I mean, you don't —
Sylvi:         Wrench has gotten an ice cream sundae.
Art (as Trip):        Yeah, you don't need to get anything for me. I can, I can take it from here.
Austin (as Ronny):        Okay, okay.
Ali (as Froggy):        Mm-hm.
Art (as Trip):        I appreciate the offer.
Ali:        A montage scene to —
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Ali:        The beloved [Debucci][unintelligible]
Austin:        Shoutout [Debucci] thank you, I think.
Ali:        [unintelligible] Sorry, that was truly my bad.
Austin:        [chuckles]
Ali:        [unintelligible]
Art:        Now we have to pay Dre a lot of money.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        [laughing] It does say in the contract, it says, if you mispronounce the name of the song, you have to pay me 7,000 dollars.
Ali:        Wow. Eh, Dre's worth it.
Austin:        Dre's worth it.
Ali:        [giggling] Uh...
Austin:        Ugh.
Ali:        I think Froggy's getting three different kinds of eggs.
Austin:        Three different kinds of eggs, sure.
Ali:        Well, that's the point of the buffet. You can't go to a place and order a bunch of different kinds of eggs.
Austin:        You're right...
Ali:        They're all just sitting there already.
Austin:        So, in your mind, the point of the buffet is, you can make more chaotic decisions, because you won't be judged.
Ali:        Yeah —
Austin:        I like —
Ali:        Wait, everybody knows that about a — buffet, right?
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Ali:        That's like, the —
Austin:        I didn't. I guess that makes sense.
Ali:        You knew in your heart. When you were making decisions [laughing] your mind knew that it, it's a place — [laughing]
Austin:        I guess that's true. I haven't been to a buffet in probably a decade.
Ali:        Sure.
Sylvi:         Okay, I've got to actually figure out what Wrench got.
Art:        I don't feel, I don't feel judged in a regular restaurant, I —
Austin:        Yes, you would. If you were like, I want scrambled eggs —
Ali:        Right.
Austin:        Plus poached eggs, plus two eggs over medium.
Ali:        I'm not saying that to someone who works at a diner. They would laugh at me.
Austin:        Yeah.
Ali:        They would start making fun of me.
Austin:        It's funny, because you can do with other things. They'll even put on their menu something where you get multiple types of like, breakfast meat, or —
Ali:        Right.
Austin:        You could get, like, I want an order of silver dollar pancakes, but also could I have, one something else. Do you know what I mean? That's acceptable.
Ali:         Oh, Jess is, Jess is a big, single pancake order, isn't she? Versus, I remember the one time in [laughing]
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        My parents do that.
Art:        Jess, Jess loves ordering one pancake. Uh, if your menu says you can order one —
Austin:        It's a little extra. Jess'll do it.
Art:        She's doing it.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        What was that place we went to that had, that was pretty good, had pancakes? You don't know. How would you know?
Sylvi:        IHOP?
Austin:        It wasn't an IHOP, no, it's like a local LA diner vibe, on some trip, like 7 years ago, that I was out there visiting y'all. And we went there, and then, it was nice. I left that day, had my suitcase with me.
Art:        Oh, it was, uh, that was Modern Eats.
Austin:        There you go. See? Boom. Shoutouts to Modern Eats.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        They're not open for dinner anymore, and it's the most frustrating thing. Also, I don't live over there anymore, but...
Austin:        [laughing] Ugh... anyway.
Sylvi:        Uh, so, Wrench has got a big plate of fries, with the Sundae, and also just like, a thing of maple syrup, and she's just dipping the fries in that.
Austin:        [laughing] God.
Sylvi:        And occasionally dipping it in the sundae too, but...
Austin:        Mmm, mm-hm.
Ali:        Yeah.
Sylvi:        Anyway.
Austin:        Sure, sure, why not?
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        You can't fuck with that.
Sylvi:        That's all she's got.
Austin:        Or, I can fuck with — I can't fuck with that. No, I can't. I thought it through. I can't judge you for it, but I can't do it myself.
Sylvi:        I have definitely done the fry with maple syrup thing before, and it [unintelligible]
Austin:        I think I've definitely done that at some point, for sure.
Art:        Well, that sounds like it's some sort of Canadian thing.
Sylvi:        No, I had this at a Denny's in America, actually, thank you very much.
Austin:        [laughing] Wow, get his ass, that's right.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        Don't you dare stereotype me.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        I think that's one of the slams. I think Denny's just sells that.
Ali:        Mm-hm. Fry slam.
Sylvi:        God. Probably.
Austin:        Fry slam, yeah, uh-huh. The iced fried slam.
Art:        Slam? Eugh.
Sylvi:        That's what Wrench calls it.
Austin:        The iced fried slam?
Sylvi:        She's Like —
Sylvi (as Wrench):        I got my iced fried slam.
Austin:        [laughing].
Austin (as Ronny):         Oh, that's good. You come up with that?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        No, it's on the Denny's menu.
Austin (as Ronny):        Ugh, I haven't been to a Denny's. I'm more of a Waffle House person, so —
Sylvi (as Wrench):        They added it a couple years back.
Austin (as Ronny):        And they don't have those up here, so...
Austin:        All right, we need more meals. Who else has got food from the buffet? [chuckling]
Art:        I think Trip has made like, the classic buffet mistake of having like, too many...
Austin:        Entrees?
Art:        No, like, the — just like —
Austin:        Oh, the other way.
Art:        It's like, 3 kinds of potatoes.
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        And, and kind of like, crammed in the corner is like, 2 sausages and a scoop of scrambled eggs, like the — it's not, it's not having a good plan, so it's like —
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        Well, finish this plate, and then maybe I can have a second, better, thought-out plate.
Austin:        Yeah. It's like, when you're like making a poster, or like a protest sign, but you didn't space your letters out right, and now you've got to cram in the last little bit.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        But with sausage.
Art:        Right.
Austin:        Perfect.
Art:        It's like going to a sausage protest. Did we get Froggy's? What did Froggy get again?
Ali:        We started this whole thing off with different types of —
Austin:        Eggs. Eggs.
Ali:        Eggs. And four pieces of toast.
Austin:        Eggs. And four pieces of toast.
Art:        Although, I think a, I think a buffet poached egg is a bad choice, I think —
Austin:        Well —
Art:        Maybe in the future they can figure it out.
Ali:        They got them in the sauce right there. There's a little, there's a guy who breaks, cracks the egg right into the, the [unintelligible] for you.
Art:        Oh, this is, this is that kind, okay. That's a nicer buffet than I've —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        You guys thought I would take you to a bad buffet? That's not even the best buffet.
Ali:        It's really good, I think it's a robot [unintelligible]
Austin:        [chuckling]
Art:        I'm used to the buffet where they have the, like a premade eggs Benedict, and that [unintelligible] is always a little —
Austin (as Ronny):        Right, right. Uh... uh... so, where's the file?
Ali (as Froggy):        Do we just set the phone on the table?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Yeah, probably? I don't have any issues with that.
Austin (as Ronny):        Oh, hell yeah, you got the whole phone. You kept it.
Ali (as Froggy):         Yeah, we kept it. We're — again, we race cars. We don't hack for files and stuff, so we figure we can just give this to you, and —
Austin (as Ronny):        Yeah, no, me either.
Austin:        Picks up the phone, begins to button through it.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin (as Ronny):        I'll figure, I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out.
Austin:        [beep boop boop boop beep boop]
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Hey, I do that, too.
Austin (as Ronny):        Ha-ha. It makes me feel like a hacker, like from a movie.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Yeah, yeah. Like, Hackers, the movie.
Austin (as Ronny):        Uh, like, yeah, like Hackers. A classic [laughing] film.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Yeah, I love the golden age of cinema.
Austin (as Ronny):        Yeah, me too. [chuckling]
Austin:        Someone show Sonny. Sonny “Crash/[Overhide]” Veranda.
Sylvi:        Fuck yes.
Austin:        Uh, uh, begins to like, you know, button through stuff. Eating a big, a big, has the phone in one hand, has the — sorry, the Palm Pilot in one hand, has a French Toast stick in the other one. Uh.
Austin (as Ronny):        Boop boop boop, beep boop boop. Beep boop boop beep. Boop beep. Got it!
Austin:        Uh, and, uh, [chuckling] there's again this kind of holo projection, but it's smaller, it's like a subdued one that's not broadcasting to everybody in the room, which is kind of like table-sized, you know? Or like, like not table-sized, [chuckling], it's like about the size of like a napkin holder on your, your collective buffet table, it's a little bit of a, of a lift of on the hologram, and it shows all of those different businesses again, you know, that big list of businesses that I gave. And, I don't know if it's more fun that they disappear, or if lines get drawn from the, the kind of different ones to the main one. But, uh, it is, it is, the thing that gets left behind is that, the jackpot supreme is being manufactured in, uh, Bluffington Coin in Slots, Bluffington Beach Coin in Slots. So, there's some sort of — and, and there's some sort of schematic, but the schematic is coated, or it's broken down into a billion different constituent parts.
1:51:38.2        So it's hard to see what the whole thing is. Uh, and he goes —
Austin (as Ronny):        There it is. There is. Jackpot supreme. I don't know what it is, but they're building it, and I got to get a, I've got to get a picture of it. I've got to get information, I've got to get a final schematic. They must have it there, in the slot machine factory. Maybe it's some sort of special slot machine, or like a robot.
Ali (as Froggy):        So down in the slot machine factory, they're not making slot machines?
Austin (as Ronny):        I mean, maybe they're also making slot machines. I haven't been there. It's weird, actually, you know, that old slot machine factory, I was telling you earlier about how me and my friends used to have a little secret hangout spot out in the marches? Yeah, we had, it was great. It was a little storage shed, where they kept all the props from all the movies they used to make when it was a movie studio. They left the props behind after the studio got flooded, and we used to just hang out there and play music and Smash Brothers, you know. The classics. Anyway, a little bit after that, they, uh, I guess they bought the space out and turned it into a slot machine factory. Some of that, you know, casino subsidy money, I guess. Uh... that's I guess besides the point. Anyway, that's the second job. You want to... if you could, go there and see if you could get a picture of whatever this is?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        I have a question.
Austin (as Ronny):        Yeah.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Aren't you the private investigator?
Austin (as Ronny):        I am, but like I said, they know me, and are looking for me. And are uh, how do I say this?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        You're not very good at your job?
Austin (as Ronny):        No, I'm — I'm pretty good at my job. It's just, the closer I get to something like this, it gets riskier. Uh...
Art (as Trip):        You probably haven't been invited into the factory, so you can't go...
Austin (as Ronny):        Oh my goodness, I'm not a vampire.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        You're right, I'm — sorry. I totally forgot about your vampirism, dude. My bad.
Austin (as Ronny):        You know, it might be easier if you just, if what you thought about me was that I was a vamp — that's easier than the truth, that's fine. Let's go with that. I'm a vampire, so I can't go into —
Ali (as Froggy):         Yeah...
Austin (as Ronny):        No, no, I'm a vampire, I can't go inside.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        An alien?
Austin (as Ronny):        Not an alien. I'm a vampire. I can't go inside...
Art (as Trip):        I think aliens can go in buildings.
Austin:        [cracking up]
Austin (as Ronny):        Is that true about them? I've never met an alien, so I wouldn't know.
Ali (as Froggy):        What's your deal now?
Austin (as Ronny):        I'm a vampire.
Ali (as Froggy):        Mmm...
Sylvi (as Wrench):        I don't believe you. This guy's not a vampire. This guy can totally walk in the sun.
Austin (as Ronny):        You've never seen me walk in the son.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Daaaa, come on.
Austin (as Ronny):        No, that's — I, I'm, ooh, spooky. Look at my fangs.
Austin:        [chuckling] Takes a big bite of another French toast stick.
Art (as Trip):        That's not very spooky.
Austin (as Ronny):         Raaaah! I vant to suck your blood! Is that — that's it, that's vampires.
Ali (as Froggy):         Would you do me the favor of eating those French toast sticks so I can talk to my teammates in private?
Austin (as Ronny):        You want me to get another table? That seems kind of — okay, fine.
Ali (as Froggy):        Well, I just — then don't listen. Because, everybody... this person's lying to us.
Austin (as Ronny):        I'm putting in head phones now, you can't hear me — so I won't be able to hear your private discussion.
Ali (as Froggy):         And he has a secret —
Sylvi:        You hear Chatahootchie playing loudly —
Austin:        Chatahootchie [cracking up]
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali (as Froggy):        He has a secret, and he's not telling us, and he has all this money. What if he's been being hired by Pluperfect?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        That's a good point. We should like, get him to tell us, like, all of the secrets before we do anything else.
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali (as Froggy):        I'm not going into a... [chuckling] slot machine factory —
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Yeah, no, same.
Ali:        [giggling]
Ali (as Froggy):        Without knowing the full story. We should be preparing for the race.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        That's true. That is kind of our job. Uh...
Austin:        Really quick, what I will say is, I did say that is the last race of the season, but —
Ali:        [laughing] Oh, sure.
Austin:        There is another race coming up, that is called the Tricity Classic, where you race through the Tricity tunnel, and dip out into each city a little bit, and then loop back in and go the other ways, you know?
Art:        Oh, that sounds like a bad idea.
Austin:        It's a terrible idea. They do it yearly. [chuckling] uh, and that race is like the pro bowl of racing. It's not part of the season. Uh, and everyone like, really gussies up their equipment, to make it look fancy. But, like, it's more about pride than about, than about winning, you know what I mean? It's kind of more of a —
Art:        I wish I knew the lyrics to that dumb rock song.
Austin:        This is a —
Art:        You said it's about pride, so I could have just like said the next line.
Austin:        Which rock song?
Art:         The Rock song.
Austin:        Oh, the song by The Rock, The Rock has a verse in.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Oh, this is Tech Nine?
Ali:        Oh, it's about pride —
Austin:        Yeah, the Tech Nine song.
Ali:        It's about power, it's about something we devour? It's about [laughing]
Sylvi:        Oh my god.
Ali:        [snorts]
Austin:        You have it! You just have it?
Ali:        It's about [unintelligible]
Austin:        How much, how many times have you listened to this?
Sylvi:        Holy shit.
Ali:        [laughing] Okay, people use it in the background of their Tiktok reels all the time. Also, I follow him on Instagram, so I see him reblogging those people. Uh, and, yeah. I mean, [laughing] it's catchy. [snorts]
Austin:        We stay hungry, we devour.
Ali:        We stay hungry, we devour, that's true, yeah.
Art:        That's what you'd do if you were saying hungry —
Ali:        It was like a million Tiktoks of people like, sitting at their desk, studying, with that song in the background being like, yeah, I'm going to pass this test, it's about pride. We stay hungry.
Austin:        Nerds.
Sylvi:         The Rock is such a fucking dork.
Ali:        He's such a dork.
Sylvi:        What a loser.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Ugh.
Art:        He's going to be future President, Dwayne The Rock Johnson.
Austin:        Ugh.
Sylvi:        What a fucking loser.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        You saying that made me add a swear word to that.
Austin:        We're on record now. Let's put us on record right now. Uh, don't vote for The Rock.
Ali:        Uh-huh.
Art:        Yeah, uh-huh. Unless it's for like, a People's Choice award.
Austin:        Right, yeah. You can vote —
Art:        And only if you liked his performance.
Austin:        Yeah, only if he was good that year or whatever, Black Adam or whatever.
Ali:        He's not going to be that good in Black Adam.
Austin:        Damn.
Ali:        I mean, he might, but not vote worthy. Anyway —
Austin:        You know what? We — you know, I've wondered privately for quite some time, where Ali Acampora lies on the ongoing beef between The Rock and Vin Diesel —
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:        And I think I have my answer.
Ali:        Okay... uh, shocking news here though, is that I agree with Dwayne Johnson when he was like, “it's fucked-up for you to make an Instagram post about your kids when we had like, we shook hands on the decision that I made.” So... I, you know, I contain, uh —
Austin:        Multitudes, this is —
Ali:        Layers, multitudes, you know.
Austin:        Multitudes, this is, yeah, uh-huh.
Ali:        I'm a very complex person.
Austin:        Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Ali:        And this... [laughing]
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        Anyway.
Art:        He should be able to crush Black Adam, that should really be in his wheel house. Anyway —
Ali:        Oh yeah.
Austin:        Glad that we're doing another different recording currently where Art has played The Rock and talked about Black Adam. I was — yesterday, we did that. So it was very front of mind.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        Right.
Austin:        Tzeon —
Sylvi:        Did Art play The Rock in that Wagon Wheel game?
Austin:        Uh, there's a side character —
Art:        Yeah —
Austin:        That —
Sylvi:        Okay.
Austin:        Is —
Ali:        [unintelligible] Spider-Man.
Austin:        Yeah, uh-huh. He's a space mechanic. He's pretty good.
Sylvi:        Fantastic.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        Anyway —
Art:        If you want to vote for me for any awards for that, I think it's really appropriate.
Ali:        [giggling]
Art:        I think I was showing a lot of range, when I took The Rock and adapted him into a new persona, just throwing that out there.
Austin:        I did, I think, we really pushed you on that and you came through, so I appreciate it.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        Anyway.
Art:        So if anyone out here is a podcast award person.
Austin:        Jeez. All right. You going to try to make, make this guy give up the ghost and explain that he's not a vampire, and instead is something else?
Ali:        Yes.
Austin:        How you doing it?
Ali:        He already has the phone, we don't have any [laughing] leverage.
Austin:        You did give him the phone.
Ali:        I guess we could be like, listen — we're not —
Art:        We could refuse to do another job, yeah.
Ali:        Going to any — because, slot machine making — [chuckling]
Austin:        I guess, I guess then, what I want is a roll to know that you don't, that convinces him to tell you, and that you don't believe a lie, you know what I mean? I want a roll here to get the truth, and to know it's the truth.
Ali:        Oh, sure. Okay, yeah. Is, am I rolling this? Is this me?
Austin:        It seems like this is a you thing to me.
Ali:        I did raise it with the group.
Art:         You're, you're the head of this.
Austin:        Are you — yeah.
Sylvi:        Is this chaos or theory?
Austin:        It depends on how you go about it, I think. You're trying to catch him in a lie, that's analytic, that's theory. If you're trying to like, pressure him or guilt him, or berate him, or —
Ali:        I think it's pressuring him, and guilting him. Because I think it's like, you want us to do this dangerous thing, you keep asking us to do all this stuff. You're asking us to do our job — my job is to race a car, buddy. And we're teammates. The three of us know a lot of stuff about each other, we spend a lot of time together, there's no secrets here, you know?
Austin:        All right, yep.
Ali:        And now you're coming into here —
Austin:        Yep.
Ali:        Asking us to do stuff, with all this money.
Austin:        Give —
Ali:        People don't get money in this town, without, you know, having some things to tell me, all right?
Austin:        All right, give me your, give me your chaos roll.
Ali:        Sorry. [laughing]
Austin:        I'm feeling pressured! That, of course, is a failure.
Ali:        No! [laughing]
Austin:        Do you want to spend a radical bonus to reroll?
Ali:        Oh, I can. Yes.
Austin:        You can.
Ali:        I will reroll.
Austin:        Give me, yeah. Go for it.
Ali:        [laughing] And that's a radical bonus that I have used...
Austin:        That's a radical bonus, delete a radical — there you go, that's a 3. That's a success.
Ali:        Wonderful.
Austin:        Uh, which I'm going to, I'm going to, I think he does try to lie, and he goes —
Austin (as Ronny):        All right, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not a vampire. I'm a robot. I'm Pluperfect's brother, and they built me, and that's — they have a automatic shutdown for me, and if I get too close, they can hit the button, and just — zip and zap, and then I'm done. So that's why I need you to help.
Austin:        Very clear lie, Absolute lie. Not a real truth.
Ali (as Froggy):         Pluperfect's brother was not hanging out in some warehouse down by the river in some warehouse. You have to tell me the truth!
Austin (as Ronny):        Okay, but it's very — it's very... [sighs] I'm part of a group, that's been together for, a long time, that investigates... strange things. Here, and then in the other two cities, in Blue and in Bluff.
2:02:16.3        We... it's hard to even conceive of this, but there was a time, it was my understanding, when Blue City and Bluff City didn't exist, or they didn't — you couldn't just get there, and people didn't know about them. I know it doesn't make any sense, because the history books all say that they were founded around the same time, and they were sister cities. I know that that's what we were taught in school, and that's what everything, seems like that's what reality is. But reality used to be different. And I know — you're looking at me like I'm making it up. I promise you this is the truth. And there are forces beyond our comprehension. Beyond a vampire or an alien, though an alien's probably closer, that have been conspiring against the people of this city, against the people of all three of our cities, and changing things, and making it weirder. And, there are people who know that I investigate that type of stuff.
2:03:16.5        And if I get closer, it's like it follows me, you understand? It's like, if I regular person goes into a store, the store is regular. If I go into the store, weird stuff happens. It's like a carry it around with me. Because I'm part of it. And so I can't be the one who goes if there, or it'll get spooky. See? This is why a vampire is easier. I didn't — when I was a kid, weird stuff happened. I found out, my aunt was part of a group that was investigating this stuff. I handled some weird stuff with my friends, we almost lost some people. And then I end up getting inducted. It's a — I don't know.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        You got kidnapped?
Austin (as Ronny):        No. Inducted. Brought into the fold.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Oh.
Austin (as Ronny):        Brought into the fold. My aunt brought me into the fold. I didn't — I used to live in Kentucky. And... we moved up here for my dad, medicine thing, doctor, you know, better care. I should be living a regular life, eating pizza. Instead I'm here.
Art (as Trip):        They got pizza up at the... at the long section —
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Do not ask for the Supreme pizza, it is not what you're expecting.
Austin:        [laughing]
Art (as Trip):        No. But they got a breakfast pizza, it's surprisingly good.
Austin (as Ronny):        Oh, word? All right.
Art (as Trip):        It's got eggs and bacon on it.
Austin (as Ronny):         Can I come back to that table now?
Ali (as Froggy):        Oh, uh...
Austin (as Ronny):        I've been across the aisle on a different booth this whole time.
Ali (as Froggy):        Well, now that there's no secrets between us, you can sit here.
Austin (as Ronny):        All right.
Ali (as Froggy):        You can eat your French toast over here. [snorts]
Austin (as Ronny):        I'm going to go get one of those breakfast pizzas. I'm still a little hungry, and I feel like that would be a good follow up. I'll be right, I'll be right back. Breakfast pizzas, anyone want a breakfast pizza?
Ali:        [giggling] Are we smash-cutting to —
Austin:        Yeah, I think we have to be smash cutting to outside of this place.
Ali:        [snorts]
Austin:        It is the Bluff City Studios, uh, uh, place, from the beginning of this quote/unquote “season” of Bluff City, which started two and a half years ago or something? I don't even want to guess.
Art:        It's been a weird two and a half years, though.
Austin:        It's been —
Art:        I think it's been, it's been a very Bluffian —
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Oh, it sure has. I'd say it's been Blue. I, you know, I think that we're all the way in some shit these days. Yeah, hard luck was [chuckling] hard luck part 1 was October 29th, 2019. So two and a half years. And then Moving Pictures, was where Bluff City Studios first showed up, was in December of that year. Uh... so, uh, so yeah. It's that part of the area. If you, if you look at the map here you can kind of see it here. Out in the marches, in what is designated Bluffington Beach. And it has been replaced, or like maybe that core foundation is all the same, with the same buildings, but they've been built on top of, and maybe all the same kind of tunnels that were running underneath, and all that is all still there, but now it became a sort of factory.
2:06:24.5        There's a big empty parking lot. It's a rainy morning. Uh, the parking lot is empty because, I think this is the sort of stuff that maybe, Wrench, you looked up on Google [chuckles] since you're the de facto Googler. Uh, the, I'd say like, 5 years ago they laid everybody off and replaced everybody with manufacturing robots, so whatever jobs they promised — it's one of those things where it was like, they got a bunch of money 15 years ago, and part of that money, subsidy was this, was to bring jobs to Atlantic City and Bluffington Beach, but the way the money was, or the contract was set up to get that money from the city was, you have to promise not to do any layoffs for 10 years. You can fire people, obviously, but you can't do any mass layoffs, outside of you going out of business or something. That got that, they hit that 10-year mark and immediately laid off the entire workforce, and replaced them with automation.
2:07:17.1        And so, maybe there's like, 2 cars here. Uh, very fancy cars, presumably for executives, or managers. Uh, I'd say it is a... the main structure is like, 4 floors tall. Uh, uh, and then there are a bunch of little side structures. I'm not going to go to the... I don't know, maybe I will. Do I have that map on this... yeah, I do. I haven't looked at this in 2 and a half years. But, here you go. Here's a, here's a map of this place. So, stage 2 is where the, the big, what is called stage 2 on this map is the big main factory at this point. But there's that parking lot that's empty, that welcome center and museum has been converted to a museum, instead of being for movies, it's a museum of Slot Machines. There's this big broadcast operations tower that is now some sort of internet tower, you know, some sort of wireless tower. And all the rest of the stuff, I bet that theater is still a theater, they've just never done anything with it. Uh, Stage One is a showroom where you can see all of the, all of the slot machines they're selling this season. Then all of that big kind of office building in the northeast is probably still exactly that. It's like, there's offices and services, a CEO office, a cafeteria and recreation center, et cetera. So... uh, I don't know what this, I don't know why craft services has all those lines. I feel like that's a basement level, maybe, with a little bit of a map drawn on top of it. So... did I move y'all over there? Yes I did, okay. So, yeah, that's, that's the vibe. You drive out there, you park — do you park in the parking lot, or do you park somewhere else and walk over?
Sylvi:        I feel like we shouldn't park in the parking lot, but —
Austin:        That makes sense.
Sylvi:        But maybe I'm just still being paranoid from the heist.
Austin:        That makes sense. Also, a lot has happened this season in this one little area. Because if you scroll down and look at this map, where it's like the city, right here-ish, like, south of where the road goes past Bluff City studios, is where y'all crashed that truck, or that van [chuckles] with a horse in it.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        All the way back in Hard Luck. So, this is a little, this is a very busy corner of Bluffington. Uh... so, what's your, what's your, what's your play here? How do you, how do you go about exploring the Bluffington Coin in Slot, uh, uh, campus?
Ali:        Uh...
Art:        But having parked somewhere else, we're still coming in through the main... entrance probably, right?
Austin:        Presumably. Probably. Yeah. I'm going to move this map over onto our other thing, so that we can look at our Gravity Roll sheets. Also, Gravity Rip sheets, rather.
Ali:        Oh, perfect, all right cool.
Austin:        Yep. Map's at the bottom.
Ali:        I'm guessing we want to be vaguely in the long term storage situation — [chuckling] unless, I mean, if they're actively using this stuff then it should be —
Austin:        Yeah, the thing, again, as a reminder, so, Stage One is, is, and I'll write on this map now, Stage One is a showroom for current-condition slot machines. Stage Two is the big production facility, is where stuff is being made.
Ali:        Oh, oh, oh.
Austin:        Uh, long-term storage and Hu's Theater are probably still those things. It's probably still filled with old movie memorabilia and a theater. Uh, and then, the rest of this is basically exactly the same, so... uh,
Ali:        [snorts] I have to go back to 2D chess and not 3D chess. Because I was like, “let's dress up as waiters, and then we can go to craft services.”
Austin:        Oh!
Ali:        And then we'll be right across from Stage Two...
Austin:        You know?
Ali:        And we can sneak in very easily. [chuckling] a
Art:        I think we should play this just straighter, right?
Ali:        Yeah.
Art:        Like, we are a successful racing team —
Austin:        Oh my gosh.
Art:        Looking to branch out into, into —
Austin:        Oh, I love it.
Ali:        [gasps]
Art:        Operating our own gambling machines.
Austin:        I love it so much.
Ali:        Yes. Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.
Art:        Please show us everything —
Austin:        Yeah, mm-hm.
Art:        So we can buy your slot machines to put in our new racing-themed casino.
Ali:        Mm-hm. It's the off-season, we're branching out.
Art:        Yeah.
Ali:        We're creating a racing casino.
Austin:        Do you have, do you have costumes? Not costumes, but like fancy clothes?
Art:        No, I'm, I'm playing myself. [chuckling]
Austin:        Oh, okay. [chuckles]
Art:        Yeah, we probably have fancy clothes, right?
Austin:        Tell me. Yeah, probably, right?
Art:        Like, uh —
Ali:        What's fancy now?
Austin:        Great question. You tell me.
Art:        Well, if everything's like energy drink...
Austin:        [laughing] Ugh.
Art:        I assume it's, uh, bad.
Austin:        [chuckling] It's probably bad. I need looks, I got to have them, I'm sorry. These are the rules.
Ali:        [giggling] For some reason my mind is like, wouldn't people in the future like, look at an Old Navy ad and be like, wow that's really what people were wearing back then.
Austin:        I love your mind, I love your mind.
Ali:        [laughing] It's — yeah.
Art:        Well, that's sort of what happens, right? When you look back at what people were wearing, you sort of, you probably see something that's not quite right, right? That's —
Austin:        Yeah. That does happen.
Ali:        Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't know why I keep saying, I keep thinking sweater vest?
Austin:        Sweater vest. Sweater vest fancy.
Art:        Sweater vest fancy.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        Sweater vest fancy.
Art:        That's what they say in the future.
Austin:        [chuckling] Uh-huh.
Art:        It's fancy, but it's not sweater vest fancy.
Sylvi:        I... I'm trying to figure out if Wrench knows what fancy even is.
Austin:        Buddy.
Sylvi:        Wearing the non-stained overalls today.
Austin:        Oh, good. Good good good. Yeah, I think that makes sense.
Art:        I think the various sponsorship agreements that, that uh, Trip has entered into over the years contain all sorts of clauses about what, what he can and can't wear.
Austin:        Oh, sure.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        No matter when. So I think, this is like, you know, like, I'm thinking like, I'm thinking like, sort of like an LA fancy, of like, a nice pair of jeans, a tee shirt and a blazer.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Art:        But it's all got sponsorship patches on it.
Sylvi:        Going to the Game Awards.
Art:        I am going to the Game Awards. Right after this.
Sylvi:        Yeah. Ugh.
Ali:        With your...
Art:        But it's like, it's like, the back of the blazer has a, you know, one foot by one foot patch for a, for an oil change facility, you know? It's got like, you know?
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Art:        It says Jiffy Lube on at back, or whatever future Jiffy Lube is.
Austin:        Uh...
Art:        Juffy Lib, I don't know.
Austin:        [chuckling] It's not Juffy Lib.
Sylvi:        Juffy Lib?! I — that's something someone called someone on Twitter.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Uh-huh, 100 percent.
Art:        [laughing] Well, it's L-I-B-E.
Austin:        Uh, so you just come in, then you just walk right into this kind of welcome center? Is that the plan?
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        There is absolutely some sort of holographic receptionist here, uh, who says —
Austin (as Hologram):        Wellcome to Bluffington Coin and Slot, your home for gambling. How can I direct you today?
Art (as Trip):        Uh, we'd like to talk to a sales associate.
Austin:        This is a big — okay. A sales associate? Okay. Uh..
Art:        Isn't that right?
Austin:        I mean, I guess, yeah, sure. A sales associate might not be able to cut the sort of deal you're talking about, but I think it's fun to ask for a sales associate. I think this, uh, this hologram, by the way, comes from the Dyno DNA, Mister DNA school of —
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:         Holographic guides. Maybe a little bit of Futurama robot devil in terms of it being like, that kind of squared-off jaw. Uh, but it kind of looks like a living, not a living slot machine. Uh, but like, squared off with slot-machiney features, you know? Uh, anyway, uh, the, the, this receptionist AI says —
Austin (as Hologram):        That sounds right. We'll, I'll get you right in touch with, with Mister Perkins. Take a seat. Uh, take a seat, and enjoy your time with these pocket slot machines.
Austin:        And a little drawer opens up, and it kind of produces three, like, little toy slot machines you can play with [chuckling], little hand held slot machines. And there's like, like a waiting area that gets lit up by lights. Uh, and about 20 minutes later, someone in a bad suit shows up. Slicked-back hair, sunglasses, which he's wearing today, even though it's a rainy day. And takes them off and puts them in a pocket, but like, in a way that you can still see them. He like, puts one of the arms of the glasses in the pocket, and the other one, the rest of it hangs out, so it's like, almost like a pieces of flair that he's wearing. And he reaches out a card to each of you, and offers you a handshake. And he goes, uh —
Austin (as Perkins):        Nice to meet you. Panther J. Perkins here. I got to tell you. Saw your performance last night. Froggy, you really, you started low in the rankings, and you got real, real good. You sped up. Most improved, most improved.
Ali (as Froggy):        Thank you.
Austin (as Perkins):         Wrench, I got to tell you, I didn't expect you to be the cause of all that chaos. I saw you looked a little, a little beat-up about it. But you should take it as a, as a badge of honor. That's what people tune in to see. And so, I think you should, you brought some entertainment to people's lives. Whoever got hurt in the mess, probably, uh, less, uh, less people got hurt than were entertained. So, big fans of both of you.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Okay.
Austin (as Perkins):        Trip, I don't know about all this stuff that's happening with Pluperfect, I got to tell you... got to tell you. Not sure which way I fall on it. You really think, uh, uh, they're cheating? Think they cheated you? Because I'm a big Pluperfect fan. I think like most of us are.
Art (as Trip):         I don't know. I don't know. I know as much as you. I heard at the same time you heard it.
Austin (as Perkins):        Okay. You don't need to raise your voice at me, Mister.
Art (as Trip):        I, that's really, I think that's a microphone issue.
Austin:        [laughing]
Austin (as Perkins):        Anyway, uh, you here to buy some slot machines?
Art (as Trip):        Yeah, we're looking to, uh, we're looking to come together, you know, pool some of our, our race money, and open a casino as a side business.
Austin (as Perkins):        A little side, little — well, you not a name for it yet? The Asteroid Belt Casino and Bar. The, uh, the Racing Trio —
Art (as Trip):        Wow, you just had that.
Austin (as Perkins):        Yeah, this is, it's my job. I help people — I'm a sales associate, but I'm also a business manager on the side. I help people get their, their businesses up and running for a small fee, and a little bit of percentage, and I could do that for you, too. Let's start with the slot machines. How many are you looking to purchase today?
Art (as Trip):        Uh, it's probably... a few dozen?
Austin (as Perkins):        I mean, you know what? Let's not start at numbers. I don't like to start at numbers. Few dozen? Okay, we should talk about numbers. A few dozen sounds —
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        [laughing]
Austin (as Perkins):        Perfect to me. That's what you want for your starter casino. Some people think you start with four. Can you believe that? Four, four slot machines.
Art (as Trip):        Well, that's not enough. People will be waiting.
Austin (as Perkins):        That's not enough. Even if you get — people be waiting. And, what are you supposed to do when they're waiting? This is how you end up with the — do y'all know about Funny Guys, that little pizza, pizza shop that makes you laugh?
Ali (as Froggy):        Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Art (as Trip):        Yeah, they got a two-slice minimum, I hear.
Austin (as Perkins):        Well, two-slice minimum, four slot machines in there. That was supposed to be a gambling hall to begin with.
Art (as Trip):        Oh, no.
Austin (as Perkins):        They couldn't, they didn't have enough slot machines. I told them to get a couple dozen. And, more than a couple dozen. You know, ideally, you want four, five dozen. A couple dozen is bare minimum. You write that down. Bare minimum, a couple dozen. Uh, I told them to get all a couple dozen, and they didn't. And so they tried to augment their business, was what they told me, “we're going to augment our business with a little bit of comedy.”
Art (as Trip):        Mmm.
Austin (as Perkins):        And I said, “yeah, you know, I'll laugh all the way to the bank with a plan like that.” Anyway...
Art (as Trip):         Wait, no, isn't that good?
Austin (as Perkins):        What, laughing —
Art (as Trip):        If you laugh all the way to the bank, I think it means you have a lot of money.
Austin (as Perkins):        Uh, well, in this case, it's a sort of like... gallows humor.
Art (as Trip):        Mmm, gallow humoring all the way to the bank, I hear you.
Austin (as Perkins):        All the way to the bank, to take out a new loan, because you ran out of money.
Art (as Trip):        Take out a — yeah.
Austin (as Perkins):        Mm-hm.
Art (as Trip):        I always laugh when I go in to get a loan.
Austin (as Perkins):        Ha-ha. I would like a large loan —
Art (as Trip):        Ha-ha!
Austin (as Perkins):        Yeah. Come with me, I'll show you the show —
Art (as Trip):        Ha-ha, give me some money! That's me at the bank.
Austin:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        Oh my god.
Austin (as Perkins):        Anyway, come with me, I'll show you the showroom, get you all set up with a couple dozen, a few dozen, many — many dozen, of our slot machines.
Art (as Trip):         Great. [whispering] That's not what I'm like at the bank.
Austin:        [laughing] For the record.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Could have fooled me.
Austin:        Uh, and he begins leading you across this kind of big, green quad. It is, it is starting to drizzle, out here. Uh, starting to rain a little bit. And, uh, but he leads you over to the showroom. You notice again, it's an empty campus. There is no one else here. Uh, but as you walk past the big manufacturing building, you do hear some clanks and clunks and — stuff's being built in there, for sure. And it's loud enough to be heard through the exterior walls. Uh, but he brings you to the showroom. Uh, and the showroom is effectively like a fake casino, you know? Uh, except it's a casino that is less worried about keeping you stuck there, and, and more worried about, it's like, what if a casino was a car dealership showroom. So it's like, big windows on the outside, ah, wouldn't it be cool to, to show off the things you buy here? You know, ah, it's so nice here. It's bright, there's free coffee. Uh, it's not — it's the worst, is what I'm saying, it's the worst of two bad worlds. But it's laid out with the sort of like rows of slot machines. [unintelligible] There's just dozens of them, and it doesn't do the thing of real casinos, where they put, you know, 10 of the same slot machine in a row. Each one next to the next one is some variation, you know? And he begins walking you through them and giving you the sales pitch on each of them. It's very boring. What is your plan to escalate from here in order to find yourself whatever the jackpot supreme is?
Art:        I mean, I have an idea, which is, just like, look visibly bored, and then try to like, get into the next area, like — these are bad, show me what you got coming up next —
Austin:        Ah...
Art:        We want to... I've seen these. Show me, show me what's next year's model.
Ali:        He's — same exact strategy as the point in COUNTER/Weight?
Austin:        Is this exactly what, what Mako did as —
Ali:        [laughing] I feel like it's pretty —
Austin:        What is his name? Why, what the fuck is his name? Uh...
Sylvi:        Oh, Drillbot Taylor.
Art:         Drillbot Taylor.
Austin:         Drillbot Taylor, of course, this is the Drillbot Taylor maneuver.
Sylvi:        Yeah. Yeah.
Austin:        I'm — it's late, you know. It's 10PM, haven't eaten dinner.
Sylvi:        It was 6 years ago.
Austin:        It was... it was —
Sylvi:        More than that.
Art:        It was 6 years ago.
Austin:        6 and a half years ago, or something ridiculous. Ugh.
Art:        Someone asked me yesterday how long we've been doing this, and I I think, couldn't come up with an answer.
Ali:        Same, yeah.
Art:        It was a really — it's —
Austin:        It's 7 and a half years, right? I'm checking. Autumn in Hieron, September 12, 2014. So that's — that's... it'll be eight years this year, 7 and a half years. Yeah. Time. Time! Time! [chuckles] all right. Uh, give me a... that feels, mmm... that feels like it could go either way, I guess. If the delivery on it is really pushy, you know? I think his instinct is like —
Austin (as Perkins):        Listen, I'm showing you the best we got right now. The stuff that's in development, ooh, that's a little dangerous.
Ali (as Froggy):        We like dangerous —
Art (as Trip):        Nah, we need the new stuff.
Austin (as Perkins):        You need the new stuff?
Ali (as Froggy):         We're racers, we deal with danger all the time.
Austin (as Perkins):        You are racers, breakneck paces.
Ali (as Froggy):        Our customers are going to expect dangerous slot machines.
Austin (as Perkins):        Taking the curves, full speed.
Ali (as Froggy):        Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Austin (as Perkins):        All gas, no brakes.
Ali (as Froggy):        Uh-huh.
Art (as Trip):        All gas, no brakes.
Austin:        Give me, give me the, give me the roll. Give me a chaos roll here. This feels like it's Trip to me. Uh, and, you know, give me a —
Art:        Yeah, I should use reputation, right?
Austin:        This is, yeah.
Art:        Because that's another place where I show all gas, no brakes.
Austin:         Yeah, all gas, no brakes, yeah. [chuckling] 2D6.
Ali:        [giggling]
Sylvi:        Oh my god.
Austin:        That is a success. Both of those are successes. Uh... he's like —
Austin (as Perkins):        You know, you convinced me. Uh, I am going to need you to, uh, sign some nondisclosure agreements, if that's all right by you. But I'm happy to bring you in to the —
Art:        Happy to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
Austin (as Perkins):        Let me just... [faloop, faloop, faloop]
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        He like, runs his hand across the PDA to send you all, like, digital PDF type things to sign and send back over. He does not make the faloop sound, that's the sound his PDA makes when he swipes it.
Ali:        Mmm.
Sylvi:         Wrench does go, boop boop boop, while signing it.
Austin:        Okay, good.
Austin (as Perkins):        Ah, you're a boop boop booper. You're one of them boopers, I see.
Art (as Trip):        Hey now, let's not get —
Sylvi (as Wrench):        What are they?
Austin (as Perkins):        No, I, I love it, it's great. That's a lot of character. Have y'all thought about making a slot machine?
Art (as Trip):        Oh, like a licensing...
Austin (as Perkins):        A licensing agreement. A licensing operation.
Art (as Trip):        You know, to be honest, I never thought about that.
Austin (as Perkins):        Do y'all have a name for the trio? Asteroid Belt, I know, was your most recent, uh, sponsor.
Art (as Trip):        That was your, uh, —
Austin (as Perkins):        I was playing on that, when we talked about the, the casino. I thought maybe there was a coventure with the barbershop. But I didn't know if y'all had a name as a racing team that we could put —
Art (as Trip):         No, I think we're going to have the barbershop have an outpost in the casino, but I don't think they want to they want to get into naming rights.
Austin (as Perkins):        Right, right. Do y'all have a leader? I assumed it would be Trip, because of the experience. But, Froggy, people love you. So I thought maybe, is it — Froggy, you're a local legend, so is it like... Froggy and their racers, and that's what it says on the slot machine? We make it, it's a big picture of you, with those gravity gloves you love, and then Trip, arms crossed. I got experience, I'm an experienced race car driver.
Art (as Trip):        Yeah, you see you've seen some of my previous merchandise, the arms crossed pose —
Austin (as Perkins):        The arms — it's a classic, it's a classic.
Art (as Trip):        Yeah, here it is. Kachow! Oh, wait, Kachow is Lightning McQueen, I can't do that.
Ali and Austin:        [cracking up]
Austin (as Perkins):        Wait, we can't, we already got the Kachow machine, we can't double-tip on that.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Kachew!
Austin (as Perkins):        Kachew you got, you can choose Kachew. Kachew feels like, different to me, though. Kachew doesn't have the punch.
Art (as Trip):        But that is the name, the, you're right that, that Froggy is the head of this venture, that's the name of the casino that we have is, Froggy's Place.
Ali:        [chuckles]
Austin (as Perkins):        Froggy's Place. Ribbit.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art (as Trip):        Yeah.
Ali (as Froggy):        I, yeah, I, you know, I was going to say that we lead from, you know, under the hood, and maybe Wrench should be our leader, but...
Austin (as Perkins):        Mmm.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Eh.
Art (as Trip):         Wrench doesn't have the name recognition.
Austin (as Perkins):        Not yet, not yet, not yet.
Ali (as Froggy):        Sure.
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Uh-huh. Nope, don't have the name recognition. Please do not put any more pressure on me —
Austin (as Perkins):        Or we could, we could, we could put a push, we — Wrench, I think we could get a whole campaign out around you, you know?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        I don't...
Austin (as Perkins):        We could do a little, a little docudrama about you time spent from this season to the next season. Get to tell your whole story, I don't —
Sylvi:        She looks like she's about to faint.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Aw...
Austin (as Perkins):        All right, all right, all right. Just send me over those NDAs, nondisclosure agreement, and I'll get you led over to the manufacturing center.
Austin:        Uh... once you send those over, he leads you over. The first thing you see when you step into the manufacturing building is, do you know those toy robots that are all squared off? They're all just like, you know, just like a classic toy robot, like, like this —
Sylvi:        Kind of like a rock 'em sock 'em robot, but a little bit less copyright distinct.
Austin:        I'd say even, it's bigger head, bigger torso, less severe than a rock 'em sock 'em robot. Like a, I've put an image here, I put an image in the wrong chat. I put an image in the dog pound, I should have put it in Bluff City. Uh, spoilers, I guess, we have our general chat in the Friends at the Table [laughing] I don't know why it's called the dog pound.
Sylvi:        Would you believe it has to do with me? Uh...
Austin:        I would. I would.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        Oh, is it because your image was briefly —
Sylvi:        It, I, I used to be the big dog, before —
Austin:        You were the big dog.
Ali:        True.
Sylvi:        [unintelligible] this is some great foreshadowing, if we really want to get into it. [laughing]
Austin:        Oh, time. Time.
Sylvi:        Anyway...
Austin:        Anyway. Fuck. Anyway. Uh, if you know those big squared-off robots, toy robots, classic, big, you know, cube torso. There are those that are like 10 feet tall, as soon as you enter this big manufacturing, like this factory. And, instead of having all the buttons and dials and stuff, they just have a big slot machine on their chest. Uh, and those are the security bots here. Uh, and, uh, I think Panther says —
Austin (as Perkins):        Oh, don't worry about them, they're just here to make sure that everybody obeys the rules. So, make sure, make sure you do that, otherwise you'll get on their wrong side. I ain't never seen nobody after they get on their wrong side. That's the end of it. So... and you'll note, the NDA you signed agrees to those terms. So, uh, uh, just, keep your head down, walk past 'em, and I'll show you the next year's models.
Austin:        And, what you see is, what I can only call very experimental slot machines. They're bad. They're badly designed. Some of them have three different arms you can pull, and each one's supposed to be like a different luck chance. Uh, the expensive one is supposed to be more lucky, but actually it's less lucky, and they're not sure they can get that through the legal system, whatever the rules are that guide slot machines. There's one that's an underwater slot machine, because someone said they were going to do an underwater casino, but the casino got canceled, but they were like, let's keep in R&D just in case somebody else does an underwater casino. In fact, I think he tries to sell you on that. He goes —
Austin (as Perkins):        Well, Froggy's place, frogs go underwater. Could y'all do an underwater casino, maybe? I don't know what type of, you know, money y'all got on the building the structure, but could, could, could be an underwater casino. We got this one ready to go. Could be a unique, uh, uh, reason for people to come. A charm point, for your casino. You got to hold your breath to go down there and gamble. No — no? It doesn't seem like you're excited about this one.
Art (as Trip):        I don't think that's for us, no.
Austin (as Perkins):        How about this one? This is a, this is a part, uh, slot machine, part microwave. You could sell microwaveable dinners. People put it in the microwave, and then when they win, it heats up their food so they can eat.
Art (as Trip):        So if they lose they don't eat? I think that's the —
Austin (as Perkins):        If they lose, they don't eat.
Art (as Trip):        That gets you to walk away.
Austin (as Perkins):        No, because you want dinner, so you got to keep playing.
Art (as Trip):        Mmm, I don't know about this.
Austin (as Perkins):        You already bought the dinner, you bout the microwave dinner. What are you going to do, walk away from it? Leave it there, cold in the machine? It's incentive. All right, all right, all right. Uh, another, another slot machine. Uh, this one is a, takes your — takes your money, but better — but better. It takes your money quicker. It's a few, it's just a few milliseconds quicker, but with that extra time, you can invest it and turn it around for more profit.
Art (as Trip):        Now you're talking — this, this is, now you're talking.
Austin (as Perkins):        It's hooked right up to the market, Wall Street and all that. So the second they put their little card in, the second they touch the arm and begin to pull it down, you're already making, making investments, you're already shorting stocks and whatnot. That's a thing you do in — I'm not a marketplace person, I'm not a Robinhood and all that, that's not for me. Any of these catching your eye? I mean, again, a couple dozen seems like the right price point and the right amount to start off a new casino, but I'm not sensing a lot of energy or excitement from y'all.
Ali (as Froggy):        Mmm.
Art (as Trip):        I just don't know that we're seeing the right stuff.
Austin (as Perkins):        This is it.
Art (as Trip):        This is it?
Ali (as Froggy):        I think we were looking for something a little more impressive, you know, a little more... supreme.
Austin:        Give me a roll.
Ali:        [cackling] I was going to wait for everyone to bully me for...
Austin:        No, that's chaos for me.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        This is... if I could make this risky, it would be risky.
Ali:        [snorts] I can't reputation for this, for being a cool, unimpressed street kid, according to this weird salesperson?
Austin:        No, because the thing that you're rolling for here is not the thing you maybe think you're rolling for here.
Ali:        [laughing] Success!
Austin:         Hey, that's a success. So, when you say the word supreme like that, he is like —
Austin (as Perkins):        Oh, huh. Could y'all — I'm going to need you to wait right here, because... if I'm going to do that, I have to get clearance from the big man. So y'all just wait —.
Ali (as Froggy):        We should have been talking to the big man this whole time.
Austin (as Perkins):        Well, big man's very busy. We don't know what type of clients we get, and so I'm the front man. He's the big man. You understand. So I'm going to go talk to the big man, and y'all don't go anywhere, because... I wish y'all would have just told me y'all weren't really interested in buying slot machines. You went through the whole song and dance. I thought I was going to make a commission. You're here talking about the Supreme Project. Goddamn. Y'all should — are y'all, you going to really do the casino thing? Because if you are, I could still sell you some slot machines.
Ali (as Froggy):        I mean, we were thinking about it. It would be good for our brand.
Austin (as Perkins):        That's what I'm saying. All right, I'm going to go get the big man, y'all stay right here. Don't wander, off, whatever you do.
Ali (as Froggy):        [giggling] What's the Supreme Project?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        If he brings us one of those fucking pizzas...
Ali (as Froggy):        Eugh.
Austin:        [laughing] But he leaves you. The thing that you've succeeded here at is not being led to this thing, but having it be revealed to you, it's certainly not a, uh, uh, —
Ali:        [laughing] A slot machine.
Austin:        Slot machine. It's something else that's being manufactured here. And it's definitely being made here somewhere. The other thing you've succeeded at is getting him away from you. So, if you did want to start sneaking around, for instance, you could do that. With the note, that there are these big, giant, toy robot slot machines in their chest who are armed, presumably, with some sort of, I don't know if they shoot out poker chips or tokens or something as weapons, I don't know what they do. Maybe they just smash you with their big hands. Maybe they don't even have arms, maybe they just have slot machine, like, arms, you know, with the little ball at the end? Very scary.
Art:        Sure. Yeah, it would be horrible to get punched by that.
Austin:        Yeah. Anyway, what do you do? You have freedom to poke around.
Ali:        Is there, is there like a spot in this place that is sort of looks like it's cut off from the other things?
Austin:        This sounds like you're looking around. That would be theory, if you're, if you're trying to piece together where to go.
Ali:        Mmm.
Austin:        You're investigating. Because it, it doesn't, it's just a factory, right?
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        I mean, it may be — not to your eyes without a roll, is the answer.
Ali:        Sure sure sure sure, yeah yeah yeah. Uh...
Austin:        You want, you want to give me theory?
Ali:        I mean, I'll fail this roll, but I can also wait for [laughing] somebody else to have a better idea.
Austin:        Uh-huh. I think you roll it, because you told me what your character was doing. I think you've got to roll it.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Ali:        Sure.
Austin:        Hey, that's a critical success!
Ali:        Is it?
Austin:        You rolled the number. Your number is 4, you rolled a 4. That's —
Ali:        Wow.
Austin:        That's a crit.
Ali:        I thought it would only succeed with a 5 or a 6.
Austin:        Uh-uh. On, if you roll the actual number, you get a crit. So...
Art:        You get Lasers and Feelings.
Austin:        You get Lasers and The Feelings. You get chaos and theory, here.
Ali:        Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Austin:        Uh, so, yeah. There is exactly that. What is it? What's the thing that sets off that there is clearly something else going on here?
Ali:        I, I feel like in my head, it was sort of the thing of like, noticing when the salesperson was giving us the tour, he like, walked by —
Austin:        Ah, yeah.
Ali:        Like an aisle that we could have walked down, and it seems — yeah.
Austin:        Mm-hm. Yeah, that makes perfect sense. So yeah, you go back and you peek at that, and you're like, hm, something's weird here. And, here's — yeah, I'll give it to you with the crit that you actually get access to this place. Uh, there are, there are, there's an uneven number of slot machines in this aisle. Uh, uh, and so you go to the last one, and you see that like, it's been used in a way that the other ones haven't been, right?
2:37:04.5        These are like, finished models, right? And it's like, they're here for storage until they get shipped out of this room. Except the 11th one, all the other rows have 10, and the 11th one is very clearly like, hasn't been moved. Uh, it's been here, and someone's used the arm. And so you kind of just like, grab the arm and pull it, and when you do, the floor slides away, revealing stairs going downward into a basement level. Uh, and, you, you head down to that basement level? Into the secret passageway underneath the, the factory?
Ali:        [snorts]
Sylvi:        I mean, me as a player, yeah, but as a character, someone else go first.
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali:        [giggling]
Art (as Trip):        Great!
Austin:        Trip heads down there.
Ali (as Froggy):        Yeah, let's go.
Austin:        Yeah, the three of you head down.
Art:        Wait, someone should stay.
Austin:        Mmm, mm-hm.
Ali:        Oh...
Austin:        I see. That's fun. Who's staying? Who's going to like, cover?
Sylvi:        Oh, boy. Uh... who... can lie the best?
Art:        It really depends on if it's a chaos lie or a theory lie.
Ali:        [giggling]
Sylvi:        Oh, boy.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Sylvi:        Do you want to flip a coin between the two of us?
Art (as Trip):        Sure.
Sylvi:        Okay.
Ali:        Oh, I mean, I'll volunteer.
Sylvi:        If you're going to volunteer, then sure.
Ali:        Yeah, I was, I was assuming Wrench might want to do it because she doesn't want to go downstairs, but like —
Sylvi:        I'm curious...
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Ali:        That guy was chummy with me, I think I could be the, the leave-behind, I think I could lie for us.
Austin:        Yeah, yeah, that's fine. That makes sense. All right. So you stay behind, and Trip and Wrench head downstairs. Uh, uh, there's like, these are very tight, uh, corridors here. Uh, and they're like a little... dank? All the presentation was upstairs. Here, not so much. Uh, uh, and it's kind of, uh, a big, weird, labyrinth of these underground corridors and stuff. Uh, uh, how do you try to find the, the way you're going here?
Sylvi:        Uh, my thinking was immediately like, there's probably some... either like, lights left on, or you can tell where foot traffic's been, like there's some sort of sign that people have been —
Austin:        Give me a, give me a theory. Yeah.
Sylvi:        Okay. That's a 5.
Austin:        That's a success, easy success! Yeah, you totally can see, maybe some wet footprints, you know, or the results thereof, of, you know, someone who came in with Mud on their shoes and left some dirt on the ground. I think this is like, paved cement ground, you know, and like, fluorescent lights. Very harsh place to be. Uh,, and you come to two things. The first thing that you come to is a thing we saw originally in that episode of, uh, uh, what was it called? We were just talking about it. It's to get, the, Catch a Devil, that what it was called? Catch a Devil? Is that right? Game? Catch the Devil, game, when this was a, a, uh, a movie studio. And it is a kind of vast, terrible tunnel, uh, that, that presumably, before we thought was maybe the tunnel that people maybe drove down, but it seems like it's just an adjacent tunnel to the tunnel project. Uh, uh, I think I described it as seeming like, almost like a huge, everlasting, and like, you know, eternally long wind tunnel or something. You know, very brutal, uh, uh, industrial design. Uh, and just, walking through it is like, unnerving. But you get past it, and you get to the other side. Uh, and you get to what is, uh, a converted stage. Uh, it's like a, like a soundstage that's been converted to a hyper, a hypertechnical, a hyperadvanced kind of a manufacturing center, where you can see, at the center of it, with a bunch of robot arms building it, and like, you know, putting in new, what do you call them? God, why am I blanking on this? Not screws, not nails, but, what's like the industrial version of a nail called? A rivet.
Art:        A rivet?
Austin:        A rivet, yeah. Riveting on armor plating. Uh, and screwing on, uh, you know, new doors, and getting, getting the wheels all into place, uh, and attaching what you're pretty sure is a pair of big cannons, hidden underneath the armor, is a giant like, tank truck. Uh, uh, and it has, uh, the — all of the parts, all the individual parts for the, the jackpot supreme are here, and they've been put together into this monstrous supertank, that you'll note, is also somehow race-certified. It has all of the things you would need to race, uh, in one of our hover races. It's just within the right weight class limits, somehow. It's like, using ultralight metals, but they're also ultra, you know, ultrastrong.
2:42:19.2        Uh, it's all, you know, cutting-edge materials. The cannons are illegal, but they're hidden. So, you're allowed to hide illegal shit if it doesn't, if you don't get caught, you know? There's probably a bunch of other weapons involved there. And then, as the centerpiece, the thing that you see get lowered in, or that is get lowered in, is a strange sort of, uh, I think the closest thing I could compare it to is sort of, a sort of, like, computer server? Do you know what I mean? Uh, except, instead of being, like, that's what the scale is. It's like a really tall computer server. But instead of just being like, hard drives, it's this long, like, magnetic tape, almost like a VHS tape, or a, like a classic computer tape, do you know what I'm talking about? And it's, it's as if that would be like a, almost like a tape head inside of a VHS player, or something like that. And all that magnetic tape is here. And it's being lowered into the middle of this machine, into this, this truck, uh, this truck/tank, the jackpot supreme. As if it's like, I mean, it would be like seeing an old, you know, room, room-sized IBM computer part being loaded into a truck today, or into like an M1 Abrams tank or something — or you know what it really looks like? It looks like the fucking Christopher Nolan Batmobile. Do you know what I mean? That's the vibe. So it's like, what if Batman put an old, 1960s computer into the middle of that. So, you have uncovered what this is, even if you don't necessarily know what it is, technically. Uh... do you get any evidence of this? Or are you just going to try to describe it back to Ronny, next time you see him?
2:44:08.3        
Sylvi:        We didn't, they didn't take our phones, right?
Austin:        No.
Sylvi:        I'll take some pictures. This is also just like, personally curious.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Sylvi:        This is like, I don't think I've seen a lot of stuff like this, that's also...
Austin:        Totally.
Sylvi:        Like, race-certified.
Austin:        Yeah. Uh, and I'm giving you that particular thing, because, uh, you would know that it's race-certified, you know what I mean? You're definitely the person that has that, uh, that sort of knowledge. In fact, you —
Sylvi:        Do we want to fuck with it?
Austin:        Great question.
Sylvi:        Before we go [chuckling]
Austin:        That's chaos to me, baby.
Art:        Like, like sabotage it. Is there — I mean, here's the thing. I have the chaos, you know what fucks with stuff like this.
Austin:        Mmm, mm-hm.
Sylvi:        Listen, I'm willing to fuck up a roll here.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Art:        All right.
Austin:        I feel like you had the instinct, too, Wrench.
Sylvi:        Okay, I'll do it.
Austin:        All right. Give me, give me your chaos.
Sylvi:        I got a 6.
Austin:        You got a 6. Do you want to spend your radical bonus, to try it again?
Sylvi:        You know what? Yes, I do.
Austin:        All right. You spend it and reroll.
Art:        Ay!
Austin:        That's a 1, that's a crit.
Ali:        [gasps]
Art:        Wow... It's not, it's a —
Sylvi:        I'm so good at this game.
Austin:        So — or, it's not a crit. It's just a success, you're right.
Art:        A success, yeah.
Austin:        It's just a success. Uh, do you want to like, disable the guns? What do you want to do?
Sylvi:        I think it's got, I want... yeah, I do think, I'm like definitely aiming for the weaponry. Uh...
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Sylvi:        I think that like, also I think just, something that makes it like, actually harder to drive.
Austin:        Yes.
Sylvi:        Uh, I don't know if that's like, messing with the suspension or what —
Austin:        What I'm going to do is lower it —
Sylvi:        [unintelligible] the episode where we find out that I don't know anything about cars.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Shh, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
Sylvi:        Okay.
Austin:        You've fucked with it in such a way that you've given it minus 1 acceleration.
Sylvi:        Okay, cool.
Austin:        You've emptied its acceleration out, basically. Uh, previously it was, it was both high in weight and like, okay in acceleration. Now it's trash at acceleration. What do you do? And, and how do you not get caught? What's your... what's your, you know — how does this not trip an alarm, or get seen on a camera or something?
Sylvi:        I think it's like — I think part of it is just like, knowing what you, uh, I think, it's, staying away from the camera is just like, finding which parts of the car like, hide me while I'm doing stuff.
Austin:        Mmm. Mm-hm. Mmm.
Sylvi:        But I think that the main thing here is just like, having... [sighs] Having an awareness of what you need to tamper with, without completely like, removing the screws or whatever.
Austin:        Yeah.
Sylvi:        Like, things got loosened a lot. I don't know. I think that's kind of where my head's at.
Austin:        Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, totally. Uh, all right. Uh, you do this, uh, you hear the sound of big, robotic footsteps, as one of those things is going to patrol back this way. And then we do a match cut from the big, uh, slot machine robot walking back to, Panther walking back, with the big man, who is, uh, Red Frame Pluperfect, the — Absolute Pluperfect's father, the robot.
Ali:        [gasps]
Austin:        Uh, they're walking towards you, Froggy.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        And I think, I think, as soon as he sees you, Red Frame starts to like, you know, squint, surprised that it is, in fact, you.
Austin (as Perkins):        Uh, Mister, Mister Pluperfect, here, here they are. Where, where'd your friends go, Froggy?
Ali:        I think Froggy's standing at like an intersection that like, leads to the corridor that people — so it's not like, if they walk [unintelligible]
Austin:        Uh-huh. It's not immediately — yeah, yeah, yeah, smart. Like, you actually like, maybe even like go towards them to make sure you give a little distance, you know what I mean? You're like, I'm going to walk further away from where my friends were.
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. Uh...
Ali (as Froggy):        Oh, uh... [unintelligible] slowly down to the... I told them I, uh, they were feeling a little parched, so the two of them walked out to the old, uh, craft services area —
Austin (as Perkins):         Uh-huh.
Ali (as Froggy):        And I figured, we wouldn't want to leave you hanging here. Hi.
Austin:        Also, just, out of character, I left craft services here, I know craft services doesn't just work at, you know —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Warehouses, but I think they just, they kept them on, you know? They bought the place, they're like, let's get some craft services in here. It's robots now.
Ali:        Oh, I —
Sylvi:        They call the cafeteria —
Ali:        Yeah...
Austin:        Yeah. There is also a cafeteria, but I left craft services here intentionally. I think they just have robot craft services. Separate from the cafeteria, for some reason.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        A waste of money. Uh...
Ali:        I think I, I assumed it was for museum-goers, since it's right next to the... yeah.
Austin:        That makes sense, sure. Yeah. Uh, I guess. Uh...
Art:        Well, it's like, fun.
Austin:        It is fun.
Art:        It's fun to go to —
Ali:        Right, you can't go to craft services everywhere.
Austin:        Exactly.
Ali:        I've got to go to a restaurant, sit down, order off a menu.
Austin:        It's like a way to gesture at the history of this historical, you know, structure.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        Anyway, they go —
Ali (as Froggy):         Mm-hm.
Austin (as Perkins):        Uh, y'all were, were told not to go anywhere.
Austin:        And Red Frame goes —
Austin (as Red Frame):        I have this. Froggy. Did your friends really go to craft services? [glare]
Ali:        Is this a robot just saying this, or am I being like robot mind-controlled?
Austin:        You're being... you get the sense that the robot is going to try to lie-detector you based on your response.
Ali:        [giggling] Oh, sure sure sure.
Ali (as Froggy):        Yeah, you know Trip. He loves to eat. Every 4 hours, he's got to have some... [chuckling] peanut M&Ms, et cetera.
Austin:        All right, give me a chaos.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        [laughing] Peanut M&Ms, et cetera.
Ali:        [laughing] This is a roll, do you want —
Art:        I thought you were going to go with some like, athlete thing, instead of just like —
Austin:        No [chuckling] I think this was more honest.
Ali:        [laughing] This is a 1D6?
Austin:        1D6. That's a success.
Ali:        [unintelligible]
Austin (as Red Frame):        I'm sending a robot to investigate. I understand you know about, and are inquiring about, Supreme. What is your connection to the project?
Ali:        What is my current understanding of [laughing] what the Supreme project [cracking up]
Austin:        You have no fucking idea. You have no fucking idea! You have no idea. You know that they're building a thing called jackpot supreme, that's all — and you know that it has a bunch of parts, and that Ronny thinks it's dangerous for the city. That's all you know.
2:50:58.5        
Ali (as Froggy):        Mister — oop.
Austin:        Uh, and that a bunch of money from the city went to building it.
Ali (as Froggy):         Mister Territory, can we, can I be honest with you —
Austin (as Red Frame):         Plu, uh, Pluperfect. Territory is —
Austin:        Territory is, now we're really in COUNTER/Weight territory.
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:         Territory Jazz [unintelligible]
Ali:        Sorry, yeah. Well, then who's Absolute Territory? Wait.
Austin:        There's no — oh, Absolute Territory is, Absolute Territory is Twilight Mirage, is the Prince —
Ali:        Oh my fucking god, I'm losing my mind — [laughing]
Austin:        That we barely got onscreen, except for the unfinished Live at the Table of Lady Blackbird. Keith played Absolute Territory.
Ali:        Jesus Christ.
Austin:        Uh-huh. Anyway —
Ali:        Wait, Pluperfect Absolute —
Austin:         Absolute Pluperfect, please.
Ali:         Absolute Pluperfect, okay, okay, okay okay.
Austin:        Is this, is the kid of this robot.
Ali (as Froggy):         Mister Perfect, can I, can I speak with you openly?
Austin (as Red Frame):        Of course.
Ali (as Froggy):        I... [laughing] you know, I'm sure you're familiar with your son's work, which might mean that you might be familiar with my work. And... I have a friend, who works in your manufacturing warehouse, who said that you were up to some stuff. Not stuff, I mean, you know. But I, I just heard that there was stuff going on here that wasn't casinos, and I figured it had to do with racing, and I wanted to talk to you, because I feel like I've, you know, gotten my name on the map here, with the racing with the two of them? But that's not —
Austin:        This is, this is chaos, if this is going to be —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Distracting them long enough for Trip and Wrench to sneak out of downstairs without being seen.
Ali:        Sure.
Austin:        Give me that roll, chaos roll. This is the most chaos shit. That's a critical success.
Ali:        Chaos...
Austin:        That's, chaos theory, baby.
Ali:        [laughing] That's chaos theory.
Austin:        Uh, well the thing that happens is, I think... Red Frame Pluperfect is like, the only person who works here, in quote/unquote — is Panther. And so, he turns to look at Panther, and is like —
Austin (as Red Frame):        You told them about jackpot supreme?
Austin:        And Panther is like —
Austin (as Perkins):        No, no!
Austin:        And then, Red Frame is like —
Austin (as Red Frame):        But they said that, they knew someone here who knew about — you are the only other one here.
Austin (as Perkins):        I would, I would never tell! I would never tell a soul about anything!
Austin:        Meanwhile, Froggy and uh, you can see —
Ali (as Froggy):        Oh, I read it on a forum. It was a — I didn't talk to this guy. [laughing]
Art:        I would like to pitch, as a, as a critical success, that Trip also walks back eating peanut M&Ms.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Perfect. Perfect.
Ali:        [laughing] I mean, that's just true. Keep the, keep this fine performance machine —
Austin:        Uh-huh. Uh —
Austin (as Red Frame):        I'm going to have to ask you all to leave. There will be no jackpot supreme for you, today.
Ali (as Froggy):        Well, just think about it, all right?
Sylvi (as Wrench):        [unintelligible] is weird.
Austin (as Perkins):        And think about, think about buying some slot machines. Just a couple.
Ali (as Froggy):        Yeah.
Austin (as Perkins):         Please? I can get you into a, a jackpot non-supreme or just a thousand, thousand credits.
Ali (as Froggy):        Do you have a card?
Art (as Trip):        A thousand credits — yeah, take a card.
Austin (as Perkins):        I thought I already gave — here's my card.
Austin:        Gives you a card —
Ali (as Froggy):        Do you have a quote? Could you email me a quote? If I write down, uh, an email to you, could you email me a quote?
Austin (as Perkins):        Yeah, yeah, yeah. Write — do you have a card? I'll take a card from you.
Ali (as Froggy):        Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Austin (as Perkins):        We'll do a card exchange.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Uh, when, when he hands you his card, it goes, “roar!” Because his name is Panther, and there's a roar, and it says, uh, “with Panther, the price is always... purrrrr-fect.”
Ali (as Froggy):        [clapping at the card]
Austin:        Like, purring, like a cat.
Ali:        Mmm, mmm.
Austin:        And the roar turns into a purr underneath. It just says that out loud as you take — it's one of those cards. And then he takes your card, and he goes —
Austin (as Perkins):        I'll, I'll email you a quote.
Ali:        I think Froggy hands over a little piece of paper that looks like a frog, but then you fold it open, you fold the frog's mouth open, because obviously it's like a top —
Austin:        Right, right, right.
Ali:        [chuckling] The top is like the frog eyes, and the top of the face, and then the bottom is — the paper is different inside it, and it looks like the inside of a frog's mouth, and it just says a phone number and an email.
Austin:        Mmm, mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Ali:        [chuckling]
2:55:19.9        
Austin:        Perfect. Uh, when you get back to your cars, uh, I'm assuming you leave at this point. This is an assumption, I shouldn't have made that assumption. Is that true?
Ali:        Mmm, no other business here.
Art:        Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Austin:        All right. When you make it back, your way back to the cars, you do notice that those camera drones that we saw before are like, all over the place in the sky. In fact, they're probably the same model as the ones that we saw back in, uh, back in Tales from the Loop. This isn't so far past Tales from the Loop that those things wouldn't be in use anymore. Uh, and you get the sense that you're being followed in your cars, uh, uh, by these things. Uh, you didn't get caught, but boy do they not trust you. Uh, and maybe even you get a tail. It might be, it might make sense at this point that they put a tail on you, as you begin to head back towards the city.
Art:        I can shake a tail.
Austin:        Yeah? Do we get a —
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        Do we get a racing montage here?
Ali:        Ooh.
Austin:        We're not going to go into the racing rules, certainly, but I feel like this has to be an escape, a — shake them in the undercity, right? Because, are you using your hovercars here? Or are you using, like, your street cars? I hadn't really thought about that.
Art:        Street cars, you can't, you can't —
Austin:        Yeah.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Yeah. Are you all in one street car? Or is it, like, do you —
Art:        Well, if we're in a street car, is it, is it Froggy?
Austin:        It might be Froggy.
Ali:        Oh.
Austin:        You're the street racer.
Ali:        [laughing] I guess so. Yeah, sure.
Austin:        What's your street car — is your street car just like the same thing, but —
Ali:        No!
Austin:        That's right, that's what I want to hear.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        What's your street car vibe?
Ali:        [laughing] Oh, okay, so now this is, because I was like, no, I'm putting all my money into my professional car that my street car is a piece of shit, but like —
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali:        That's not true, right? Like...
Austin:        I don't know!
Ali:        It's probably, it's probably like an old racing car, in that it's like —
Austin:        Mmm.
Ali:        It's like, it's like, uh, what did Brian have that one time? He always had like, really sweet cars. Uh, [unintelligible] Brian. [laughing] When I came up with, uh, Froggy's street car, I was like, people, what did people in like, the 1950s think that a future car would look like?
Austin:        Right.
Ali:        Because it would be funny that someone actually in the future would have this car. But, uh, sure. Yeah. What's the blue car that he drives. It does not matter. [cracking up] It does not matter. But the...
Austin:        It's probably a Honda or something, right? What is — let's see, the cars of Brian O'Conner.
Ali:        Okay, what I'm currently thinking of is the Nissan Skyline.
Art:        It's a, it's a Skyline.
Austin:        Oh, it's a Skyline.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        It's a Skyline, right, yeah, sure.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Sure.
Ali:        Putting this in the Bluff City —
Art:        Sorry, I was eating chili [unintelligible]
Ali:        Oh, thank you, thank you.
Austin:        I appreciate it. Yeah.
Ali:        I think it's, like, it's nice, but it's like a car that was used in racing that hasn't gotten the repairs from when it was doing that, because this is like, my errands car now.
Austin:        Yeah.
Ali:        Uh...
Austin:        Sure.
Ali:        And I don't really have it like that yet, to be like, I can't let people in CVS see me in a shitty car, but like [laughing] that's Froggy in 5 years, hopefully.
Austin:        [laughing] Yeah. Ugh.
Ali:        Uh...
Austin:        And we've set up that like, there's this under, there's like the above the fog and the under the fog inside of Atlantic City now, where like, there's like a layer of smoke has kind of, and smog has separated the kind of hover boardwalk and all the nice casinos that are all, you know, 40, 50 stories tall now, from the lower, you know, folks. Uh, it's that classic bad cyberpunk trope of the kind of tiered city.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        So we get that montage of you trying to get away here. What, uh, what are you, how do you — are you doing this? Are you doing this chaos, or are you doing this theory? What's this look like, as you try to shake your tail?
Ali:        Mmm...
Austin:        Not dancing.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        You know, shake your tail in the other... way.
Ali:        Right, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Uh...
Austin:        Lose them.
Ali:        It's tough, because I feel like I have a hard time as a person not thinking of losing someone as something that requires a lot of thought.
Austin:        Me too, yeah. Especially if you're like, thinking about, uh, making the right turns, and about what the city's layout is.
Ali:        Right, yeah.
Austin:        That feels theory to me.
Ali:        Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'm going to roll this, and then we'll see... that's a...
Austin:        That's a failure.
Ali:        That is a failure.
Austin:        That's a fail — did you already spend that radical bonus?
Ali:        I had 2.
Austin:        You had 2, so you have one left.
Ali:        I'm going to, I'm going to spend my 1.
Austin:        You're going to spend it? All right. Let's do it.
Ali:        This feels like an important roll.
Austin:        It does. Hey, that's a success, that's a 6. Boom. Uh... all right. What's it look like? Tell me how you lose these, this combination of a car that's following you, plus, plus these like drones, these camera drones?
Ali:        Uh, well, I guess because it was a theory roll, I guess it's just a thing of like, knowing the streets better than, like, an automatic AI and like a private detective would know. Like, I raced on these streets, man, I know —
Austin:        Right.
Ali:        [chuckles] I was out here like, putting spray paint on the streets, and listening to the police things to see where they were, to see if I could race at the right time, et cetera
Austin:        [chuckling] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.
Ali:        So I know that like, if you're going up the 5 — I don't know New Jersey streets, but [laughing]
Austin:        Yeah, but I get what you're saying.
Ali:        But also the 5 is a highway so you're not going to be able — anyway —
Austin:        Yeah, you're not, that's not a great place to shake anybody.
Ali:        Uh, if you're going up Main Street at 3PM, you know, there's, the school is going to get out —
Austin:        Right.
Ali:        So I can, I can start to go on there, and then I can turn at this corner, and then they're going to get in the school traffic and I'm going to be going this way. But then I can't drive around this other place, and like... you know.
Austin:        [unintelligible]
Art:        Ali, if this ever happens again, it's the Monopoly City.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        It is, this is the —
Ali:        Oh.
Art:        Monopoly is Atlantic City.
Austin:        That's Atlantic City.
Ali:        Wait, Monopoly takes place in New Jersey?
Austin:        Oh my god. It takes place in Atlantic City! Yes!
Ali:        That's not New York City?
Art:        That's why there's a boardwalk.
Austin:        That's Atlantic City!
Ali:        Oh...
Austin:        That's why there's a boardwalk. Yeah. Yeah.
Ali:        Atlantic City has a Madison Avenue? [laughing]
Austin:        It did.
Ali:        Is it not one of them? Sure.
Austin:        Maybe, I don't remember [unintelligible] I actually don't know —
Ali:        I don't play Monopoly enough. Madison Avenue is like the only one that I could think of right there.
Austin:        It certainly used to have all these streets, at the very least.
Ali:        Sure.
Austin:        It's, it's, it's Atlantic City in like the 1920s or whatever, you know? Uh, it certainly still has, it certainly still has a number of these streets, you know? That's what I'll say. Uh, so... anyway.
Ali:        Wasn't —
Austin:        You lose them. Go ahead.
Ali:        Was Monopoly like a, like a, like a, “stop buying up real estate in Atlantic City,” type game, or was it like a glorifying...
Austin:        Uh, Monopoly, uh, was originally called, “the landlord's game.”
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Uh, and it was a criticism, it was a game as critique of landlords. Uh, and Parker Brothers stole it from the woman who made it.
Ali:        [gasps]
Austin:        Uh, and, uh, turned it into a game about how you could get rich and wouldn't that be fun?
Ali:        Yeah...
Austin:        Uh-huh. Okay, sorry, they didn't steal it. They acquired the patent.
Ali:        Sure, sure.
Sylvi:        That's... how rich people steal [unintelligible]
Ali:        Uh-huh.
Austin:        Uh-huh. 100 percent. 100 percent. Uh... so... uh, sorry, I'm just double-checking some of these. Yeah, this all seems right. Anyway, that's true. Uh, and, uh, so, yeah. You lose them, and presumably, you meet back up with Ronny, with the photos and the information. Uh, and, I'm going to summarize this because we've been going for quite some time now. Ronny lays it out to you that there's one more job —
Ali:        [snorts]
Austin:        Ronny pays you for all this, by the way. Whatever the number I said before, he paid you that. 15,000 for the original, and then let's double it. Let's say it's, so 30, so it means you each get 10k, from these, these first two jobs. And I think, I think he tells you straight up, he can give you 100,000, a cool 100k, if you do the third and final thing for him. And this is something he can't do for other reasons, which is, he's not a race car driver.
Austin (as Ronny):        They're going to enter that thing, the jackpot supreme, in the Tricity Classic. And whatever that big, weird, magnetic tape thing, that they were loading         in there is, that's no good. I saw things like that when I was a kid, and it was doing weird things in the tunnel, making people disappear and whatnot. And they're going to do something like that again, I'm pretty sure. Maybe bigger. I need to blow that thing off the road.
Ali (as Froggy):        Damn.
Austin (as Ronny):        Don't let it finish the race.
Ali (as Froggy):        Finally, a job for us. Got us sneaking around all over town.
Austin (as Ronny):        You did a good job, I'm, I'm impressed!
Ali (as Froggy):        We, we race cars!
Austin (as Ronny):        And you got a race — and now you understand, now it all comes into vision. The clarity, the vision of Ronny Highsmith Junior is, is apparent in your mind.
Austin:        I'm slipping into the other guy's voice. Because he was so fun to do.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Ronny's from the south, but he's been up here for most of his life now, so anyway...
Austin (as Ronny):        I knew that the final step here would be getting into a car, driving a car real fast, maybe smashing your car into another car. And that's why I knew I had to come to you. I guess I didn't know for sure it was a car, but I had, I had suspicions.
Ali (as Froggy):        Did you find anything funny in that person's phone?
Austin (as Ronny):        Oh yeah. A bunch of bad selfies.
Ali (as Froggy):        [laughing] What a loser.
Art:        [cracking up]
Austin (as Ronny):         They're, they're real bad at flirting. Uh, I saw... their bank account. They're very rich. Extremely rich. Scary rich.
Ali (as Froggy):        You want to transfer some of that?
Austin (as Ronny):        I'm a little worried about that, because that's, that, suddenly, you go into that sort of situation, then you get the bank mad at you.
Ali (as Froggy):        [unintelligible]
Austin (as Ronny):        That's one — yeah, but the bank is going to, you know what I mean?
Ali (as Froggy):        Okay, but, this person's going to call up a charity and be like, “give me all that money back”?
Austin (as Ronny):        Yeah, they're evil.
Ali (as Froggy):        Oh yeah. Mmm.
Austin (as Ronny):        They're an evil person. Of course they're going to do that.
Ali (as Froggy):        Yeah, true.
Austin (as Ronny):        I'll see what I can do.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Ugh. So yeah. That is, that is the thing. This thing has a, the thing that, that they were loading into it is called the MP pulse, and it stands for either, uh, sorry, the MP shift, and it's either the magnetic pulse shift or the metaphysical shift device. Uh, both of those are bad. Uh, and, uh, it's going to try to use it during this race. Uh, in order to make something happen. Uh, I guess we'll have to see what. Next time. Uh, but the, the thing you'll have to do is, is either run it out of the road, or there's a secondary win condition, which is, if you lap a car, if you lap a car in this game, then the next lap, it gets removed from the race by the referee drones because it's been disqualified. If you get lapped once, you're disqualified. So either, you have to bust through its armor and knock it off the road, or you have to lap it. And in lapping it, disqualify it.
