AUSTIN: [Typing While Speaking] Time dot is. Hey everybody, “to me old is always just ten years older than I am.” — Bernard Baruch


ANDREW: [Thoughtful] Ah.


ALI: [Thoughtful] Hmm.


AUSTIN: Uh, do we wanna do a clap at...45?


[Silence]


[SYLVIA Clears Her Throat]


AUSTIN: Yeah? Is 45 good?


ART: Yeah, 45 is good.


ALI: Mhm.


[Silence]


[Quick Series Of Claps]


SOMEBODY FAR OFF-MIC: [Disappointed] Awwwww.


AUSTIN: [Unconvinced] Hmmm.


ANDREW: Oof. Man, someone in the background even— [Cross] said “Aw” for how bad that was.


AUSTIN: [Cross] Yeah, that was someone in my other room, they were like “Boo, no!”


[ANDREW, ALI, and SYLVIA Laugh]


ART: Top of the minute?


AUSTIN: Top of the minute. Top of the minute.


[One Clap And Many Claps In Unison Less Than A Second Later]


AUSTIN: [Impressed Exhalation] [Confident] A single clap. Perfect. [SYLVIA Laughs] It always is.


ART: Why do you always set yourself up to get roasted on Clapcasts? [Laughs]


AUSTIN: [Confident] Perfect.


[SYLVIA Laughs]


AUSTIN: They're always... Okay I need people who are on this call to look away really quick, because I need the… [ALI: Okay] I need other people to...to witness something. Um, actually I’ll do the intro first. [ALI Laughs] Welcome to Live at the Table, an actual play live stream, focused on critical worldbuilding, smart characterization, and fun interaction between good friends. Today we are playing Honey Heist, a game by Grant Howitt. Joining me today: Ali Acampora—


ALI: Hi! You can find me @ali_west on twitter.com


AUSTIN: Also joining me, Sylvia[1] Clare—


SYLVIA: Hey you can find me on twitter @captaintrash and you can listen to my other show Emojidrome on iTunes or Google+


AUSTIN: Andrew Lee Swan—


ANDREW: You can find me on twitter @Swandre3000.


AUSTIN: And Art Martinez Tebbel.


ART: Hey, you can find me on twitter @atebbel.


AUSTIN: We’re the A-Team here tonight. You notice that? All the A’s are here right now.


ANDREW: Oh damn, actually.


ALI: Oooo.


AUSTIN: Too powerful. Too powerful a collection of A-names [ALI Laughs] that we had to decide to play the goofiest game we’ve wanted to play for a long time. Honey Heist— again, a game by Grant Howitt. Grant makes a bunch of different one-page RPG’s, 200 word RPG’s— stuff like that. And so, let me just pitch you Honey Heist as it says right here: “It’s HONEYCON 2017. You are going to undertake the greatest heist the world has ever seen. Two things— One: You have a complex plan that requires precise timing. Two: You are a GODDAMN BEAR.” A lot about this game is rolled. Going from your character creation and role, to the hat you’re wearing. There’re some pretty simple stats system that we'll get to, and there’s also the matter of prep. So I need everyone who is not—


[Camera Shutter Sound]


AUSTIN: Oops I didn't mean to take that photo. Everyone who is not— [Laughing] everyone who’s in the game to NOT look at the screen really quick. [ANDREW: Okay] To not look at the live stream or the chat. [ALI: Okay] At least the next 30 seconds. Because the chat… [Whispering] You’re with me [ART: Ahh] and we need to— stop looking!


ART: I didn’t!


[ALI and SYLVIA Laugh]


AUSTIN: We need to go here to this random dice roller right here...


[ALI and SYLVIA laugh]


AUSTIN: But no one can see because they’re not looking at the screen, ART. And then roll one, two, three, four, five, six dice.


ANDREW: That’s a lot of dice


AUSTIN: Yeah. 6d6, what’s good? Alright…


ART: Did you just tell us?


AUSTIN: No I’m not gonna tell you. I rolled 6 dice. You don't get to—


ART: Ohh


[AUSTIN and ALI Laugh]


ART: I thought you said sixTY-six.


AUSTIN: Sixty-six— yeah you got it! Um...


[Typing]


AUSTIN: Oh my god. [Laughs]


ALI: Hmm?


AUSTIN: [Barely Containing His Excitement] Okay this is really fucking great!


[ALI and ANDREW Laugh]


AUSTIN: What’s the next one, the next one is that. So…


[Typing]


AUSTIN: Then, we’ll do the bears— no! Oh no!! [Laughs Hard] And finally… Oh I have to roll one more. I have to roll one more. Remember this one, chat. That one right there.


[Silence]


AUSTIN: Okay. So, it’s…


[Typing]


AUSTIN: Aaand…


[Typing]


AUSTIN: I think these might be the same thing, but we’ll see. Oh my god. Okay. This goofy fuckin’ game. This game ruuuules. So… [Typing] I need each of you to roll 3d6 to determine the type of bear you are.


ART: Query?


AUSTIN: Yeah?


ART: Should we roll them individually because they’re separate tables?


AUSTIN: No, we can just— You do a roll of 3d6 and it’ll show you what these three dice are.


ART: Alright.


AUSTIN: Actually, you know what? Y’know what, let’s do three and then we’ll do a fourth for the hat.


[ALI Laughs]


ART: Well the hat’s a d8.


AUSTIN: Oh you’re right, good catch. Damn, good catch. Alright Dre, what were your numbers?


ANDREW: Uh, 4.


AUSTIN: Which is?


ANDREW: Unhinged.


AUSTIN: Okay. [ANDREW: Uh-huh,] Next number.


ANDREW: 5: sun bear.


AUSTIN: Sun bear! What does a sun bear do? What’s the skill associated?


ANDREW: Sense honey.


AUSTIN: Oh shit, can I get a good picture of a sun bear real quick? Because I think I know a sun bear.


ANDREW: [Cross] I think I know a sun bear too.


ART: [Cross] It’s not a live at the table if you’re not showing some people animal pictures.


ANDREW: Oh!


ALI: [Cross] Wow


AUSTIN: [Cross] Damn, look at this big ol’ sun bear— 


ANDREW: Hey can I tell you something? I was talking about sun bears last night.


AUSTIN: Hell yeah.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: What were you— what were you talking about?


SYLVIA: They’re a real good bear.


AUSTIN: I like that they got that versace necklace already. [Cross] See that V?


ANDREW: [Cross] One of the people I was working with was excitedly telling me about sun bears. [AUSTIN: Damn.] And their cool tongues.


AUSTIN: Oh don’t look at the screen. Everyone look away from the screen for a second. There was a bad bear picture. There was a bad one I closed it, don’t go back.


ANDREW: What was wrong?


AUSTIN: It was bad, I don’t wanna talk about it— [Art and ANDREW: Ohhh] I said not to look.


ANDREW: [Dejected] I know...


ALI: Wait let’s look at this good one where it like [Fighting Laughter] looks like a man’s legs—  [Vigorous Laughter]


ANDREW: What!?


AUSTIN: Excuse me? [Ali Laughing] you can just link me that one directly to me and I’ll open it.


ALI: [Struggling Against Laughter] It’s just— [Voice High-Pitched From Fighting Laughter] it’s crawling like a man does!! [Laughs]


[ANDREW laughs]


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh Hard]


AUSTIN: Oh I hate this one.


[Everyone Laughs]


ANDREW: [Cross] Ahh, that’s my bear. That’s my bear.


AUSTIN: [Cross] This is like—  What if like, Shaggy from Snoopy Doo was Scooby Doo.


ART: Oh my GOD.


ANDREW: Snoopy Doo!?


AUSTIN: [Laughing] Snoopy Doo!


[ALI, Still Laughing, Laughs Harder]


ANDREW: Hi, this is my bear, Snoopy Doo.


AUSTIN: Oh my god... [Takes a Breath] [Laughs] Is that your name? Snoopy doo?


ANDREW: Yeah, I’m Snoopy Doo! I’m Snoopy bear, the unhinged sun bear thief.


AUSTIN: Snoopy Doo the un— 


ART: Wearing a flat cap!


AUSTIN: Oh wait, thief was the last thing your rolled?


ANDREW: Yeah and I’m wearing a flat cap.


AUSTIN: So name your bear if you want, so Snoop— I hafta write this down in my notes… So okay, Snoopy Doo, hang on a second I have to get my notes over here [ALI Laughs]


ANDREW: [Cross] Got my Sami Zayn hat on.


AUSTIN: [Typing] [Cross] “Dre equals Snoopy Doo. Who is—” [Ali laughs]


ART: Oh where are the ghosts in the chat?


[ANDREW And AUSTIN Laugh]


AUSTIN: [Typing Resumes] “Unhinged sun bear”— which is “sense honey”— and you’re a thief. “Plus thief”. And then what’s your hat type?


ANDREW: It’s a flat cap.


AUSTIN: Flat cap. Now someone had a question about what a flat cap was, and I’m gonna search for “flat cap” and hope I don’t get another terrible—


ANDREW: It’s a Sami Zayn hat.


AUSTIN: Oh it’s a Sami Zayn hat! Okay, I gotcha. [Impressed] Damn, and he’s wearing a flat cap? “I’m Snoopy Doo what’s up?”


ANDREW: Snoopy Doo skankaroo.


AUSTIN: [Laughs Off-Mic] Is this also a ska bear?


ANDREW: Yeah, uh-huh.


AUSTIN: Okay, good. [Laughs]


ALI: [Laughs] I’m gonna hit enter.


AUSTIN: Go for it.


ALI: Okay.


ART: Oh no! [Laughs]


[SYLVIA and ALI Laugh]


AUSTIN: Alright, we could make a decision right now. Do we want duplicates to be allowed: yes or no?


ALI: I’m fine with rolling one more.


AUSTIN: We can just say—  Well the thing is we have two duplicates here and that’s too many duplicates.


ALI: Oookay


ART: Maybe only one duplicate per...


AUSTIN: Reroll— yeah, yeah, there we go: one reroll per. Or one duplicate per roll. A hundred percent that's allowed. Go ahead, Ali, give me another reroll. 3d6.


ALI: Okay [Chuckles] Wait, but just the one?


AUSTIN: Just the...just—


ART: [Cross] No, roll all three.


AUSTIN: Roll all three.


ALI: Okay.


[Typing]


AUSTIN: Alright you got— So, you tell me what you got.


[ANDREW Laughs Hard]


ALI: Okay so I am a—


ART: Ah! That’s great!


ALI: I am a slick Panda [AUSTIN: Slick] and I am the muscle of the team.


AUSTIN: Hell yeah. And we gotta know— we gotta know—


ART: Roll that hat!


AUSTIN: Yeah. Gotta know what your hat is.


ALI: Oh okay— wait, wait, wait— yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.


AUSTIN: You know what I need? Is some index cards for y’all to fill out.


ALI: [Excited] Ooo, I’m a cowboy!


[ANDREW Laughing Hard and Clapping]


ART: Woah!!


ALI: Yes!


AUSTIN: Oh, are you a cow— [ALI: Yes!!] Oh, a cowboy hat, what a perfect— [ALI: Yes!!] Do you have a bear name? Do you have a name for this good bear.


ALI: Um...Well I just learned that I'm a cowboy so give me a minute.


AUSTIN: Oh, you know what? Absolutely, you deserve it.


[ALI and ANDREW Laugh]


[Brief Silence]


ALI: It’s Randy. It’s Randy. It’s Randy.


AUSTIN: Wow, you did not need a minute, you needed seven seconds.


ANDREW: Randy the pandy.


ALI: Mhm!


AUSTIN: And that’s what I love about Randy the bear [Chuckles]


[ALI And ANDREW Laugh]


AUSTIN: I’m just gonna put some— here’s what's gonna happen: I’m gonna put these cards down, and I’m gonna need y’all to just fill these out for me


[ANDREW Coughs]


AUSTIN: Also, there’s not really enough space for it so I’m gonna do this... There we go. Boom.


ART: [Cross] Alright, I’m gonna—


SYLVIA: [Cross] Alright, should I— oh okay.


ART: I’m gonna roll— or did you wanna go Sylvia?


SYLVIA: No you can go ahead.


AUSTIN: I’m gonna put these on the map layer real quick, that way they don’t get moved around. Whoever wants to go next, go next, let’s see.


[Bleep]


AUSTIN: Alright, Art? Oh buddy. [ART Laughs As If In Slight Discomfort] Oh buddy. And you don’t have the good luck of having any duplicates. [ART: Nope.] So tell me—


ART: I am an incompetent [AUSTIN: Uh-huh?] black bear [AUSTIN: Uh-huh.] [Cross] driver


AUSTIN: [Cross] Which means what is your specialty?


ART: Climbing.

AUSTIN: Okay. And wait, did we go over what the panda specialty was?


SYLVIA: No.


ALI: Oh, it is... “Eating anything that looks like bamboo.”


AUSTIN: That’s good and we’re gonna figure out what that looks like— what that means in play. 


[Bleep]


AUSTIN: So Ali is the muscle— sorry, Randy is the muscle...Do you have a name for your bear?


[Pause]


AUSTIN: Art?


ART: Not yet, I mean, I just rolled [Cross] my hat.


AUSTIN: [Cross] Oh you need the hat, I’m sorry. You're right. Apologies, apologies, apologies.


ART: I got a crown.


AUSTIN: [Excited] You got a crown!? The incompetent king black bear?


ART: Yeah.

[Pause]


AUSTIN: Do you— Do you have a name now?


ART: Charles.


AUSTIN: King Charles, gotcha. Uh, I forgot to write “cowboy hat”, sorry I’ll put that over here.  [Typing] “Cowboy hat Randy.” And then… [Speaking While Typing] “Black Bear...Climbing—” You were what? The driver?


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: [Typing] “Driver...” Don’t know what that means in this scenario.


ART: [Exasperated] What do you mean? It— I’m— I’m the driver!


AUSTIN: [Appeasing] Okay, yeah. Y’know what? Can’t argue with that. I cannot. And you have a crown on. [Typing] “King Charles.” Love it. [SYLVIA: Alright]. Alright Sylvia, it all comes down... to this.


[Bleep]


SYLVIA: Okay.


AUSTIN: Rookie. Love it.


SYLVIA: Okay. I’m a rookie polar bear. Uh...and the polar bear’s ability is swimming.


AUSTIN: Good.


SYLVIA: I rolled a 5, so I’m the thief.


AUSTIN: You’re also the thief.


SYLVIA: I’m also a thief. Double thieves.


AUSTIN: You know what? It’s a heist. That’s allowed.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Now we need the real shit: 1d8.


[Bleep]


AUSTIN: That is— [Chuckles] [SYLVIA: Fez.] That is a fez. That is a fez.


[ANDREW Laughs] [Somebody Slow Claps]


SYLVIA: [Disappointed] Man.


AUSTIN: Did you not want the fez? Were you pulling for something else?


SYLVIA: I mean...everyone wants the cowboy hat. I’ll take the fez. [Chuckles]


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Here’s what I’m gonna tell you—


ART: I was also hoping for the cowboy hat. [Chuckles]


AUSTIN: Here’s what I want both of you to do: Take that feeling... And I need you to use it. [Chuckles]


[SYLVIA and ART Laugh]


AUSTIN: Incorporate that into your characterization. You see the hat that cowboy Randy has, [ALI And ANDREW Laugh] and I need you to know that you want that hat.


[ART Sighs]


[SYLVIA Joins In The Laughter]


AUSTIN: So yeah, if y’all can start filling that— Okay, you’ve already begun. [Entertained] “Hi my name is... SNOOPY DOO, The Unhinged Sun Bear Thief w/a Flat Cap.” [Laughing] “Randy the Cowboy. Slick (Not a city slicker, a slick cowboy)”


ALI: There’s a difference!


AUSTIN: “Panda (Eats anything that looks like bamboo) Muscle (Strong and Mighty)” What else?


ALI: Oh is that it?


AUSTIN: Is that it for you? Those are the three— oh the hat.


ALI: Yeah I have my cowboy hat, that’s clear, I think. [Chuckles]


AUSTIN: Okay King Charl— Okay we needa start going into the second phase of this, which is stats. I need all of you to also write on the cards that you currently have three points in both of your stats. Your stats are Bear, which is “Use to maul stuff, run and climb, shrug off damage, scare people, and generally do bear-stuff”— and Criminal: “Used to do anything not directly related to being a bear” [Laughs]


SYLVIA: [Typing] Still gotta fill out my card [Chuckles]


AUSTIN: Um... I’ll talk about the rules really quick. Whenever you act and the outcome is in doubt— so y’know, not just for walkin’ down the street, but maybe for... Y’know, running down the street away from some very angry convention goers who are trying to trap you or something—  roll a d6. If it is equal to or under the relevant stat, you succeed. If you’re using your bear special skill or doing something related to your role, roll 2d6 and pick the lower. So that’s pretty simple, right? So for instance, if Snoopy Doo was trying to crack a safe, you would roll [Laughing] 2d6 and take the lower number which would need to be under... probably under your Criminal. Because that’s something that’s not being-a-bear. Does that make sense?


[Pause]


ANDREW: Yes.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Okay. Uh, Sylvia, can I please get like, a name and also—


SYLVIA: I’m trying to think of one really quick [Cross] while I fill stuff out.


AUSTIN: [Cross] Yeah. Okay, gotcha.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Here’s the thing I like about the King Charles thing: I know you’re gonna add a number under where is says “Bear,”  but I like the idea of the incompetent King Charles be like, “I hafta fill out a nametag… ‘incompetent black bear driver...‘ what else do I put? ‘Bear’” [Laughs] Ali I like your star system, this is nice. [ALI: Thank you.] That’s good.


ANDREW: Hmm…


AUSTIN: God... [Takes a Breath]


SYLVIA: How do you spell- I’ve seen 2 spellings of Snowcone, [ALI Laughs] and I wanna know [Cross With AUSTIN] which one to use— 


AUSTIN: [Cross] One’s a brand I think. Right?


ART: [Cross With SYLVIA] Yeah, the “Sno” is a brand


SYLVIA: [Cross] Okay, then I’ll add the W so we don’t get sued


AUSTIN: Thank you, I appreciate it. I appreciated you.


SYLVIA: [Quietly] Perfect.


AUSTIN: Are you more like a shaved ice or are you like...like is the flavor in the snow cone or is it…


SYLVIA: I mean—


AUSTIN: Do you know what I mean?


SYLVIA: Yeah!


ART: For everyone else, has Dre’s card loaded in? ‘Cause I have just like, three cards then just like…”Hi my name is Snoopy Doo” just like [Audio Cuts Out][2]


SYLVIA: [Laughs] Real good.


[ANDREW Laughs]


AUSTIN: You should probably reload.


ART: Okay,


[Pause]


SYLVIA: To be honest, I don’t really like snow cones all that much, I just think it’s a cute name for a polar bear.


AUSTIN: It’s a very cute name for a bear, Sylvia. [ALI: Yeah.] I’m here for you.


SYLVIA: I’m more of a slushie person.


AUSTIN: Slushies are great. Y’know what? Here’s what— I’m gonna put this out here real quick: You know what else is a good name for bear?


SYLVIA: Also a good name for a bear [AUSTIN: Slushie] now that I've said that out loud.


AUSTIN: Could be both.


SYLVIA: [Laughing] Just depends on which zookeeper’s there today.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.. You know Dax and Darren named this bear different things.


SYLVIA: Okay yeah.


[ALI Laughs]


SYLVIA: There we go.


AUSTIN: Great. Perfect.


SYLVIA: Perfect


AUSTIN: “Hunny Senz.” Thank you. Thank you for writing down what your special ability was. I’d almost forgotten that you had a honey sense. You hear Hunny Senz’s new EP? [Impressed Exhalation]


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: That shit go. Hunny Senz #KingOfRnB


[SYLVIA Joins In The Laughter]


AUSTIN: Keep it relevant, y’know? [Takes a Breath] Um... okay… Hafta look at my notes. We have a lot— I had to do a lot of prep for this one, y’know? So... Alright. So here is my question: Which of you— okay, first of all: Do you...hmm. I’m gonna go through the rest of the rules so that we know what type of game we’re playing, actually. So, I talked about the ri— the dice rolls. Are we good on that? That you wanna roll— it’s one die unless you are rolling something that is connected to your special trait, with your skill or your role, right? Again, if you’re a thief and you’re doing a thief thing, then you would roll 2d6 OR if you are a, uh… A black bear and you’re climbing— y’know a ladder, even, for instance— you could roll 2d6, right? Um, I actually— whatever it is, you’re roll— you’re climbing anything, you roll 2d6, and the goal is to get under your related score, either your bear or criminal, depending on what the thing is. That’s all clear?


[Pause]


AUSTIN: Can I get a verbal confirmation?


ALI, SYLVIA And ART: Yes


[ANDREW Growls]


AUSTIN: Ugh, Dre, you know what? I love that you’re already leanin’ in—- sorry, sorry. Snoopy Doo, I love it so much.


[Dre Growls In Satisfaction]


AUSTIN: Perfect. That was a dog, which is sort of a bear.  Number four: Changing States. “When the plan fails and you run into difficulty, move one point from Criminal into Bear. Greed: When the plan goes off without a hitch, move one point from Bear into Criminal. You can voluntarily move one point from Bear into Criminal by doing a flashback scene in which you and your other bears plan out the heist over coffee and cigarettes in the back room of a seedy bar. You can voluntarily move one point of Criminal into Bear by eating a load of honey. The End, Five: If your Criminal stat reaches 6, you’re lured into a life of crime and betray the party. If your bear stat ever reaches 6, you flip out, bear-style and lose it, presumably to be picked up by animal control in a half-hour or so.” So, does that all make sense? Everyone on board with the bear train? 


ANDREW: Yep.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


ART: [Confidently] Choo-Choo.


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh]


AUSTIN: Love it. So here’s what I need to know: Which of you… One: do you all know each other already? Or were you like, put together by a third party bear as like a… heist team?


ART: [Cross] Reservoir Dogs? [Laughs]


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Like Reservoir Dogs, exactly!


[ART Laughs]


AUSTIN: In fact, Ali linked a really good bear that we didn’t get to, it’s on the list. Where’d that good bear go? Here it is. Look at this good bear. Here: This is a… spectacled bear? Apparently. Which seems to be some sort of very cute bear, is my read on the spectacled bears.


SYLVIA: Yeah that seems right


AUSTIN: So I think maybe the spectacled bear is like, the one who got you all— like, lets you know about this potential situation. How do you all know… Glasses, the spectacled bear?


[Pause] [Ali Snickers]


AUSTIN: Who also runs the bar. It’s not glasses because the spectacles, it’s glasses because he keeps the glasses clean.


ANDREW: [Thoughtful] Mmm.


[Pause]


AUSTIN: How do you all know spec— spectacles? No, glasses?


ANDREW: Um... I’m his honey man.


AUSTIN: Okay, Glaess… [Typing] So snoopy doo is... So you get the honey and glasses moves it for you, or like whatever.


ANDREW: [Cross] Yeah I got a sense.


[ALI Laughs Excitedly]


AUSTIN: Oh so it’s like, you have a long relationship with glasses? Glasses and you go way back [ANDREW: Oh yeah, yeah] you’ve done a bunch of different honey heists.


AUSTIN (as Glasses)[3]: I’m gonna tell you Snoopy Doo— nothing like this. This is a whole ‘nother level. This isn’t some back of the grocery store BS. This is the real deal. Holyfield.


AUSTIN: Randy, how do you know glasses?


ALI: Um...I broke up a fight in his...bear bar?


AUSTIN: Love it. Thank God. Thank god for randy. [ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN (as Glasses): Randy, listen. I know you and I have never done a like... official thing, where you’ve been a bouncer and I pay you money, but you’re kinda like a bouncer to me. Y’know what I mean?


        ALI (as Randy): Thank you for saying that, that means a lot.


[ALI Laughs]
        
AUSTIN (as Glasses): And so I wanna bring you in on something and if it goes well, I think maybe you could become the new doorman— sit by the door, anything goes bad? You deal with it. That’s free honey every night.


ALI (as Randy): Sounds good pardner.


AUSTIN: Alright, Randy the cowboy [Speaking While Typing] is like, makeshift bouncer. Slash muscle. In Glasses’ bar. [Whispering] I don’t know where this bar is yet, I’ll figure it out. [ALI Laughs]


ANDREW: Oh wow!


AUSTIN: What’s up?


ANDREW: I just found a video of what a sun bear sounds like and they actually like, bark.


AUSTIN: Link me that shit


ANDREW: It’s scary, hold on I gotta get the timestamp right.


AUSTIN: Alright good, thank you. Uhh… King Charles. How do you and Glasses know each other?


ART: I got a hot hand at the dice table.


AUSTIN: Oo, a hot hand?


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: A hot— wait, but then did you lose it all too?


ART: [Unsure] Yeeah. Or I spent it on this crown and a car?


AUSTIN: [Confused] A ca— Okay, right! You’re a driver.


[ANDREW Laughs]


AUSTIN: Okay. Okay, good. Yeah it’s definitely the after hours bar, thank you Katey in the chat. Absolutely. [Laughs] Anton in the chat says “‘You’re like a bouncer to me’ is way better than ‘You’re like a son to me’”


[SYLVIA and ALI Laugh]


AUSTIN: So wait, is this like— 


ANDREW: You’re like the Playstation 2’s The Bouncer to me.


AUSTIN: So— [Laughs] Right exactly. So this is what it is, Randy— not Randy sorry. Glasses is like...


AUSTIN (as Glasses): King Charles. King Charles. I love the crown by the way. What a great touch you got there.


[Silence]


AUSTIN (as Glasses): You listenin’ to me Char—? Charles! [Snapping] Charles!


ART (as King Charles): Huh? Wha? [Growls]


AUSTIN (as Glasses): [Annoyed] Okay...


ART (as King Charles): Sorry Boss, drifted off there for a second.


AUSTIN (as  Glasses): I’m not even your boss yet I’m giving you an offer— it’s okay though, you can call me boss, I like it when people call me boss— Point is, you got a lot of money during that dice game, and I think it’s time to earn it back. Before certain people come knockin’, wantin’ it back. Y’know what I’m sayin’?


ART (as Charles): That is not how I understand gambling to work, but yeah, I getcha.


AUSTIN (as Glasses): I’m just sayin’ certain people don’t like that you took their money. And you—


ART (as King Charles): Well they shoulda rolled better.


AUSTIN (as Glasses): That’s not how dice works Charles. One person rolls the dice.


ART (as King Charles): I did great at it. I was hittin’ the 7’s. 7 and 11. 7 and 11…


AUSTIN (as Glasses): You were hittin’ the 7 and 1, you're damn right. You're gonna hit something bigger than—


ART: (as King Charles): ...and then I hit 7-11!


AUSTIN (as Glasses): [Exasperated] Okay… Just— can I count— [Takes A Breath] You got that car, right?


ART (as King Charles): [Excited] Yeah! It’s a sweet ride.


AUSTIN (as Glasses): I just need you to do a quick drive. Drive some people to a place. Wait for them. Get them back—


ART (as King Charles): All my drive are quick drives.


AUSTIN (as Glasse): You've been watching the Fast and Furious again?


ART (as King Charles): Yeah and people do not react well to seeing a bear drive a car.


AUSTIN (as Glasses): Yeah I’ve seen the movies, I know,


ART (as King Charles): Yeah they run and scream and I gotta hide.


AUSTIN (as Glasses): Well just get good at that then, because I need you to take these people to the Honey Heist— [AUSTIN Briefly Breaks Character, But Transitions Back Into Glasses Voice Smoothly] Hmm, sorry. The honey convention, I’m already thinking of it as a heist. You know my mind, y’know what I’m sayin’. I’m thinkin’ two steps ahead. The newspaper, it’s gonna hit— Jennifer Jetta [???][23:25], she’s gonna say “Honey Heist.” I’ve got a head for narrative you see. You’re just a driver, that’s it. Okay?


ART (as King Charles) : [Quietly] I’m just the driver, that sounds…


AUSTIN (as Glasses): You’re the goddamn driver!


ART (as King Charles): There you go!


AUSTIN: And like, a big claw on your shoulder. Alright. Snowcone—


        ART (as King Charles): Yeah!!!


AUSTIN: [Laughs] Also to be clear, the person whose money you took was Glasses’. [Chuckles] That was a threat. He doesnt wanna make it directly to you but— anyway... Pay him back in service. Snowcone/Slushie, which do you go by with Glasses?


SYLVIA: Uh… I think the general rule of thumb is whichever one they say first. Because it’s been like, “Oh, one zookeeper calls me this one and the other one calls me that so it’s I dunno.”


AUSTIN: Gotcha.


SYLVIA: But I think the way that… I think, actually, I think he calls them Snowcone specifically because the last polar bear was named Snowcone.


AUSTIN: Gotcha.


SYLVIA: And they think this is the same polar bear 


Austin: Goddamn. Glasses needs glasses honestly.


SYLVIA: [Laughs] So yeah and they just— Slushie just got here, basically. And is very confused about this whole situation but happy to make friends.


AUSTIN: So how does Snowcone know you? Or sorry, how does Glasses know Snowcone?


SYLVIA: So...Snowcone just goes to the bar because she sees all the other bears going there


AUSTIN: Yeah.


SYLVIA: There’s an arcade machine built for bears which is really cool. [AUSTIN: Love it.] So, mostly known by the mysterious, quiet polar bear that spent a lot of time playing whatever the bear equivalent of Tapper is, I guess. I dunno.


AUSTIN: Some kinda honey tapper probably right?


SYLVIA: Yeah, yeah!


AUSTIN: Honey Tap? Um… Oh! I know exactly what this is! So Snowcone— So, one day, it’s late and Randy is like… Randy? Why do I keep saying this guy’s name is Randy? It’s Glasses. Glasses is like,


AUSTIN (as Glasses): Hey snowcone. C’mover here.


SYLVIA (as Snowcone): Huh? Oh, hey!


AUSTIN (as Glasses): Hey I really appreciated the discretion during the last job, right? Y’know what I’m talkin’ about?


Snowcone: [Uncertain] ...Yes. Yeah?


AUSTIN (as Glasses): See, that’s what I’m talkin’ about? Playin’ dumb. That’s the discretion I’m talking about. So I got another thing just like the last one lined up. Bigger. They're really gonna need your expertise. You’re the only one in this crew who’s ever done anything like this before.


SYLVIA (as Snowcone): I mean, I guess it just takes some practice. I think anybody could get the hang of it.


AUSTIN (as Glasses): Y’know that’s the optimism and teamwork and camaraderie that they’re gonna need. So, you know the basic plan. It’s gonna be a very similar thing. We’re gonna do uh...a Hornet Swipe, but with a… but with an alpha protocol attached. Right? So you just let them know how that goes. And you take the lead on this one. So, alright. Don’—   you can use the back room to plan. We got the chalkboard. We have the whole thing. The whiteboard. Whatever you— chalkboard or whiteboard— it’s your choice. You’re the professional, that’s what I always say. So you just go back there and get them together, I told them to come through next Wednesday and you know I’ll have the flyer back there to let you know when it all is. This is the last time we talk until the honey comes in. Sound good?


SYLVIA (as Snowcone): Oh! Yeah! Honey? Awesome! Yeah, okay. Sure!


AUSTIN (as Glasses): Discretion I love it.


AUSTIN: And he gives you a little claw. So okay yeah the relationship with glasses between you is that he thinks you’re the old pro. [Typing While Speaking] “Glasses thinks you’re the old Snowcone” [Laughs]


[SYLVIA and ART Laugh]


AUSTIN: [Typing] “Old Snowcone” [Laughs] “Who was an absolute pro-thief.” Okay [Chuckles]


[SYLVIA Chuckles]


AUSTIN: And you’re in charge.


SYLVIA: Yeah, [Laughing]  I just wanna say. The thing you guys are gonna see written on the whiteboard is “How To Swim”


[ALI And AUSTIN Laugh Hard]


AUSTIN: [Takes A Breath] So—


ART (as King Charles): Oh, so you alternate with the paws!!


[ANDREW Laughs]


AUSTIN: So here’s what I can tell you right now, that you already know about. There’s a flyer back there. It’s pinned to a corkboard. There’s a chalkboard, then there’s a corkboard, then next to the corkboard is a whiteboard. The corkboard is between the chalkboard and the whiteboard, you can use both. [Takes A Breath] There is— coming up soon—  a major honey convention. HoneyCon 2017. And here’s the thing there hasn’t been— or 20XX, ‘cause it’s Bluff City and it’s in the 20— it’s in the 2000’s probably.The last HoneyCon was a long time ago and it was in Bluff City proper. It was really and truly in like, downtown Bluff City. It was in the convention center. Not a great convention center but y’know... [Cagey] It’s alright! It’s alright!


[ART laughs]


AUSTIN: This year it’s been brought back which people are excited about and it’s in um.... I need a good name for like, the Egg Harbor Township equivalent here. Uh… Or like, a Mays Landing. Something Landing wouldn’t be bad. What’s another word for like... a dock?


ART: A pier?


AUSTIN: Like a p—- a pier.. It should be like a freshwater though. Or like a bay. It could be a bay. Something Bay wouldn’t be bad actually.


ANDREW: Is a Lagoon freshwater?


AUSTIN: A lagoon is a mix. I dunno if New Jersey has any lagoons. Also, I’m not sure that’s true about lagoons, I might’ve just made that up, [ALI laughs] 100%. I just searched for “map of new jersey lagoons.” Uhh...yeah! I guess there’re some lagoons. Or this is a place just called The Lagoon which is like...shitty-ish. You can’t do that. What about… [Takes A Breath] I like bay, I want a like a like a… Yolk Harbor isn’t bad.


[ALI And ANDREW Laughs]


AUSTIN: It’s a good— ‘cause like. Egg Harbor is the real place I’m thinking of. Yolk Harbor is pretty good and so: Yolk Harbor is having the new— this year’s honey convention— HoneyCon. Here’s the thing about— it’s down the road, right? So y’all are at the— I’m guessing— you’re all at the zoo, right? And you’ve already... You’ve already— I wanna make it clear you won’t hafta roll— well you might hafta roll to get out of the zoo, but you have a way out of the zoo. You’ve been out of the zoo before, that’s not the problem. You at least have— you have a route to get out of the zoo, This is like, down the road by like. It’s like a 20, 25 minute drive. This is— driving is gonna be important for sure. Maybe even a 30 minute dr— it depends on traffic, honestly. And it depends on if you take the highway or the local streets. The thing about about Yolk Harbor— also, shoutouts. Who said Yolk Harbor? I wanna give proper accreditation. RowanBG in the chat. Thank you RowanBG for Yolk Harbor.


[30:05]


AUSTIN: Yolk harbor is— by my roll, as the chat can agree— or can… cosign, is a rundown fishing village. [Laughs] And so it’s just kinda this like it’s it’s you can see the Bluff City skyline in the distance, but it’s a lot of like, little fishing piers and it’s much more mainstreet usa. It’s still in Bluff County, right? It’s still...the people who live there may be selling and going to the city for work but it’s quiet. Um you know, it’s...they watch a lot of CBS in this town. Y’know what I’m sayin’? And you know that it’s being run by someone named Georgia Heights, who… is a beekeeper. Who is— the whole thing is, she wants to get more cred— she wants attention for her honey. She has what she calls um… I need a...what’s a better name, what’s a better word than bougie?


[Pause]


AUSTIN: [Laughs] Actually, it’s just Bougee’s. [ALI Laughs] They’re called Bees, but she adds the word “bougie”. So like, Bougie-ees is what she calls her bees.


ANDREW: Not Boug-Bees?


AUSTIN: Boug-bees is better.


ALI: Bougees.


[Brief Pause]


AUSTIN: ...I’m gonna go with Boug-bees [Laughs]


[ALI And ART Laugh Hard]


AUSTIN: Which are like, really— she like, pampers her… She pampers her bees. She thinks of them as being like, just extremely, extremely, high-class. Luxury bees, and the honey that they produce is also very luxury. And it’s all a front. Like, this is [Second Guessing] Hmm, I don’t know, maybe you hafta try the honey to see if it’s really good or not. But she is selling her Boug-Bees honey, at this convention and she’s in fact, throwing this whole convention so there can be a [Bleep] coming out party for her Boug-Bees line of honey. Her Cardi Bees [Laughs] Thank you Dre, in the chat. [ALI Laughs] So that is like, who’s running it. It’s her motive for running it. You get the impression just from this flyer about the event that she’s kinda shitty. But I couldn’t tell you how until you meet her. So those’re the things that you know about it. It’s happening at a pier. Like, at the the Yolk Harbor piers. Um, or docks— that she has rented out for an entire weekend. It is a three-day event. You check in on Friday and it goes all the way through Sunday night. So it’s a  big window here. I would say that it’s probably fair to say, maybe that— based on the way there are circles on the flyer— Glasses has circled “Honey” and he’s also circled “Bougie Bee Honey,” and it’s like, “okay, these are his goals: He wants you to get as much honey as you can, and he also wants you to get some of the special honey.” Which I’ll just say straight up, is quote “Ultra Dense Mega Honey from especially posh bees” which is what I rolled on the “Aside from loads of honey, the prize is ____” 


[ALI And Andrew Laugh]


AUSTIN: What you don’t know is some stuff about what the security features are here, and also some other stuff and we’ll get to that later. So you all come together for the first— or have you all worked together? Do you know each other? [Pause] Just from being around the bear exhibits?


ART: How many bears are there?


ALI: Enough, right? [Laughs]


SYLVIA: Well, a minimum of four.




ALI: Uh-huh.


SYLVIAL I feel like...I don’t know— 


ALI: We know each other around town, right?


SYLVIA: Yeah


AUSTIN: Yeah, maybe.


ART: I don’t think the criminal bear community is so big.


AUSTIN: I’m not sure you’re all criminals yet.


ALI: Yeah.


ART: [Matter-Of-Factly] I have a Criminal score of 3.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Fair. But y’know, everything you do that isn’t bear-like is crime.


[ANDREW Laughs]


SYLVIA: Yeah you drive a car .


ART: [Laughing] That’s only ‘cause I’m not allowed to get a drivers license.


AUSTIN: It’s a crime. You don’t have a driver's license.


ART: Also, I’m a bad driver.


ALI: [Cross] You know I— 


AUSTIN: [Cross] Mike— Just real quick Mike Lunzer in the chat says Polar Beariat, which is a great spin on proletariat, thank you.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: [Under Breath] God. So, I’m gonna put it in snowcone’s hands. How do you kick off this meeting? We just get a shot of King Charles, Randy the Cowboy, and Snoopy Doo, are you in chairs or are you just seated on the floor?


ANDREW: Uh, I don’t do chairs.


AUSTIN: Are you standing, what’s the—


ANDREW: Standing, yeah.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Like, arms crossed? Against a wall? Or full attention?


ANDREW: I’m bouncing on the balls of my feet.


AUSTIN: Okay. Not on an actual ball?


ANDREW: No. Jeez, Austin.


AUSTIN: Sorry.


ANDREW: How fuckin’ dare you?


AUSTIN: I’m sorry, Snoopy Doo


[ALI Laughs]


SYLVIA: Snoopy Doo’s a professional.


AUSTIN: Snoopy doo is extremely professional. Also really quick, I just wanna go over it. Can I get everyone’s pronouns? This is not a joke, I just wanna make sure I’m referring to them right. So Snoopy Doo?


ANDREW: He/Him


AUSTIN: Randy the Cowboy?


ALI: He/Him


AUSTIN: King Charles


ART: He/Him


AUSTIN: Snowcone/Slushie


[Pause]


SYLVIA: Slushie’s a girl. I wanna play Slushie as a girl, so it’s not just a bunch of boy bears.


AUSTIN: I’m [Laughs] I’m with you. Alright. Snoopy Doo standing up. Randy the Cowboy— how you doing in this?


ALI: You know…[Laughs] Randy’s casual. Um, I think I’m like leaning back, but standing, legs crossed. Um, paws on hips, like, as if he had gun holsters [AUSTIN: Mmm. Mhm.] but is a bear and does not [Laughs]. And as far as like the…”do we know each other?” conversation. I like— I think Rany’s a nice guy. Says his please and thank yous. Says hello to people on the street. [Laughs]


AUSTIN: Wait. Are you just playing Arthur Morgan? But a bear.


ALI: Youuu [Laughing] You don’t know that. You don’t know that I’m doing that


AUSTIN: I don’t know that. King charles?


ART: I’ve posted a picture in the Discord of—


AUSTIN: Yeah, lemme take a look here. [Muttering] uh...Bluff City.


ANDREW: Aw man


ART: …the posture—


AUSTIN: This one right here, just laying down. Are you on a table doing this?


ART: Yeah I think so.


AUSTIN: Y’know what? Perfect. Thank you King Charles. Alright, it’s time to kick this thing off. Snowcone. What do you say and do as you’re in front of all this whiteboards.


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Right. So. Not entirely sure why glasses asked me to do this, but I think we got a new show sometime this week. In the water area of our pavilion. And I guess he thinks I should get you guys ready, because apparently I’m the only one who knows how to swim. What’s— [Muttering] Hold on, what’s this…?


SYLVIA: And then that’s when Snowcone notices all the “Honey Heist” stuff that’s been left around. [ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Mhm!


SYLVIA (asSnowcone/Slushie): Right…


ANDREW (asSnoopy Doo)[4]: Hey Snowcone!


SYLVIA (asSnowcone/Slushie): Mr. Doo, what can I do for you?


ANDREW (asSnoopy Doo): Snowcone! Quick question: How much does a polar bear weigh?


[Pause]


SYLVIA (asSnowcone/Slushie): [Sighs] [Under Breath] Good… I uh… I have a feeling you’re gonna tell me.


ANDREW (asSnoopy Doo): ‘Cause I heard it’s enough to BREAK THE ICE!!! Yeeeeah, let’s get this thing going, Snowcone!


SYLVIA (asSnowcone/Slushie): [Audibly Uncomfortable] Okay...


[ALI and AUSTIN Laugh Hard]


AUSTIN: We’re canceling Hieron, I’m sorry, everyone. [Everyone Laughs] Um…. Samot lives happily ever after. The Heat and the Dark gets filled with the love of bears and honey. And we’re just gonna do Honey Heist from now on. Thanks everybody. That’s gonna do it for tonight.


[ALI and SYLVIA laugh Hard]


AUSTIN: I’m gonna get out of your way. Continue please.


[Pause]


SYLVIA (asSnowcone/Slushie): Alright, so I think I’ve been a little misinformed. [Nervous] Do any of you know what we’re here for? Glasses was very vague with me. I think… [Sighs] My predecessor at the zoo and I have had a lot of confusion going forward. He was my cousin. He’s at the trenton zoo now. So, he was just kinda cagey the— [Worried] No— no pun inten—


ANDREW (asSnoopy Doo): Ahhh! So coooold!!!!


[ALI Laughs]


        SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): [Quietly Annoyed] Okay…
ALI (asRandy the Cowboy)[5]: I heard we were lookin’ for some honey


[Everyone Laughs]


SYLVIA (asSnowcone/Slushie): Oh, okay. So that’s why we have this thing here! We’re going here for the [Snaps Fingers] Okay, starting to put things together here.


SYLVIA: And then Snowcone/Slushie is pinning things to the— not really with any order. Just like, putting them organized on the pushpin thing.


AUSTIN: [Entertained] Mhm!


SYLVIA (as  Snowcone/Slushie): There’s one. Put the next one symmetrically next to it.


ALI (as  Randy the Cowboy): Need some help with that ma’am?


SYLVIA (as  SC): Oh! Yeah, please. They left a bunch of stuff here for me.


ALI: Randy saunters over and— [Beneath Uncontrollable Laughter] helps you put up your crime posters. 


ART: Hey what does it look like when a bear saunters?


SYLVIA: Good, is what it looks like


[ALI laughs]


ART: Are you on hind legs, are you on all fours? How much hip action is there?


ALI: I think that Randy, uh... on hind legs, walking like a person. But carries a bunch of his weight like, in the lower half of his body. Like a very eggplant shaped [AUSTIN: Love it] bear. [ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: God...the cowboy hat really helps the figure. [ALI: Mhm!] Honestly. [Sylvia: Mhm.] It really— it’s like figure on top of the eggplant, I love it. [SYLVIA: Mhm!]


[Pause]


AUSTIN: Good question from Matthew Guzdal— Matthew Guzdial in the chat: “Does Randy have spurs?”


ALI: Oh [Laughing] Sure?


AUSTIN: Perfect


ALI: I think that um...uneven pairs, [Laughs] because randy stole one of them off of.. [AUSTIN: Great. Has one Spur] One each off of people that were visiting the zoo, who was wearing cowboy boots.


AUSTIN: Thank god. [Pause] So you’re sauntering over. You help with [ALI: yeah] the pushins. King charles are you just napping during all of this?


ART: Uh-huh


AUSTIN: Okay


ALI Laughs


ART: Someone will tell me the plan when I wake up just—


ART (as  King Charles) Loudly Yawns


AUSTIN: [Chuckles] I think we jump into that moment. Okay let’s abstract this out a little bit. What’s the plan?


ART: Yeah tell me the pl— [Audio Cuts Out]


ALI: What day is it?


AUSTIN: You have um... You have a week.


ALI: Oh, okay.


AUSTIN: Let’s say— oh I said it was wednesday when you were meeting so you have a week and a couple of days. You have plenty of time to plan. Or like get stuff. 


[Pause]


AUSTIN: Do you know what I mean? Like if you needed to go get disguises or wanted to like, scout the place out or… takes breath whatever you want to do I want to give you a week and a couple of days to make it happen.


ALI: Ohh.
ALI (as  Randy the Cowboy): Listen everybody: I think we should do this Thursday night. And the reason I think that is so all of the honey can be ours. We should get before any of those— [ALI Laughs] those bee-lovers get a taste of it themselves.


[Pause]


ALI (as  Randy the Cowboy): So let’s be on our game.


ART (as  King Charles): Alright what’s the game?


AUSTIN: [Under His Breath] God...


ANDREW (as  Snoopy Doo): [Quiet] It’s to get that honey


ALI (as  Randy the Cowboy): Well. We’re gonna need a car [ALI Laughs]


ART (as  King Charles): I got a car.


ANDREW (as  Snoopy Doo): Oh shit!


SYLVIA (as  Snowcone/Slushie): [Incredulous] What!?


[ALI And AUSTIN Laugh]


ART (as King Charles): I own a car


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Yo, what kinda wheels you got?


ART (as King Charles): Okay, I mean I don’t wanna brag or nothin’, but I got a ‘65 Cadillac Eldorado convertible


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: [Speaking While Typing] “‘65 Cadillac El….”


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Woo-wee!


ART: If you show a p— [Audio Cuts Out] red, or this is over.


AUSTIN: Wait, you need it to be red? The first one, there it is! You have one of these? It’s an alright car, it’s the ‘65.


ALI: Wait where?


AUSTIN: Wait, sorry. Do you wanna link it in the chat?


ART: I’m not on it, I just did this a little bit ago.


AUSTIN: Okay [ALI Laughs] This one here. [ART: Pretty good.] This one here. This one here


[ALI And SYLVIA And ANDREW Oo and Ah]


AUSTIN: It’s shiny right?


ART: It’s real shiny.


ANDREW: That is a car you could fit four bears into.


ART: You sure could. [AUSTIN: Mhm!] Probably a fifth bear if you tried.


AUSTIN: We’ll see


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh]


AUSTIN: Love it. Okay. [Takes A Breath] Car: Check. I think we just get a picture— a photo of your car goes up on the board.


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Now we need...is we need a way to get that honey outta there.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): I don— Listen: I’m not a planner, right? [ALI Laughs] I go by feel. I just feel that honey and I get it. But I feel like the car could also get us outta there.


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Righ— but the car’s not gonna go in the building with us


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Why not?


[ALI Tries To Say Something In Character But Struggles With Laughter]


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): How— I never seen a car go in a building.


ART  (as King Charles): You never been to a car show


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): You ever seen a bunch of bears rob people?


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Well—


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Because I have! And it works


ALI: [Laughs] I’m just trying to do the smart— 


AUSTIN: Uh-huh. [ALI laughs] You’re trying to hit the “Good” button. You’re try— whatever it is. “Not Antagonize”. [Sylvia Laughs]


[ALI Takes A Deep Breath]


ALI: Wha— hmm...


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Okay, well, we need. We need— what else do people need? We need papers.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Oh, okay, I see, I see. You wanna. Hey Randy, you wanna know what I think you wanna do?


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): What do I wanna do? [ALI Laughs]


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): I think you wanna BAMboozle ‘em!!


[ART Laughs]


        SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Oh!


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): You got that pardner


ART: I thought it was gonna be some kinda pun again.


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): That’s...fun.


AUSTIN: Bamboo. It’s bamboo. That was the pun. ‘Cause—


ART: Ohhhh!!!


ALI: Ahh


AUSTIN: ‘Cause randy


ART: ‘cause randy’s a panda. Got it


        ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Yeehaw!


[ANDREW LAUGHS]


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Yeah, we gotta let em know that honey’s ours. Walk in proud and take it.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Okay that’s... That’s not bamboozling...


AUSTIN: I just—


[ALI, SYLVIA, And AUSTIN Laugh]


ART (as King Charles): That is not bamboozling. Bamboozling is tricking.


AUSTIN: [Laughing] You’re thinking of bambeezling


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Thank you King Charles!


AUSTIN: I just need to— just a quick rule note as you’re doing planning— just read it from the text here: “Name your bear if you want. You’re NOT a talking bear per se. But you can sort of mangle human speech through your bear mouth, maybe.” And then in parentheses, “(You can talk to each other though)”  So all this is fine. But I need you to know that any plan that involves you talking to a human being is gonna involve you going like... [Makes Grumbly Bear Noises]


ART: We can approximate human speech so like… [Guttural] “Hrgghhe-llllooo” seems like isn’t bad


[ANDREW Laughs Hard]


AUSTIN: Perfect. Yeah that’s what it would be. Exactly. [Gruff] Hhhhrroonneeeyy! [Growls] [Laughs]


ART: Graahonney inspectorrrr!


SYLVIA: [Under Their Breath] Oh my god… [Laughs]


AUSTIN: [Laughs] Exactly. Yes. Just like that. So I wanted to let you know that’s what that plan sounds like. Which is fine by me,: Austin.


[Pause]


AUSTIN: So far, you need a car: got it. Check. We need papers: Check.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: I mean, not-check. You don’t have papers yet, you’re gonna hafta figure that out. So that’s one thing you want between now and Thursday night, is papers.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): I gotta case the joint. I gotta find out where they’re keepin’ that--


AUSTIN: Three: You wanna case the joint, okay. Sounds like we got enough to start with here. How does this plan kick into action? Are you only working at night? You workin’ in the day, what you doin’?


[Pause]


AUSTIN: Do we just get, like, a montage of this stuff? And the setup is like— or not the setup, but like, we get Dax and Darren being very confused by why all the bears are so sleepy every morning. [Everyone Laughs] And the answer is because you’ve all been up at night, doing heist prep? I’m gonna say that’s what happens. So yeah, so here’s what I want: I want— we’re gonna get into it now. How do you consistently get out of the zoo, without being spotted by security? Without being picked up by people who check the pens to make sure you’re like there for morning feeding time, or to go and check that all the bears are where they’re supposed to be? Getting ready to roll here. Once you do this once, I’m not gonna make you do it, it’s like you’ve figured it out, you got the system down, you’re good.


ANDREW: I can use my very long tongue to unlock the door.


[SYLVIA Goans]


ART: [Disgusted] Oh my god. Can you?


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh]


ANDREW: It’s not a good lock. Have you seen these sun bear tongues?


AUSTIN: I saw the tongue, I saw the tongue. It’s a long tongue. [ANDREW: Yeah] Is it— okay...


ANDREW: Here’s the thing you don’t know: there’s a padlock on the door, but they lost the key long ago. So they just put it over the slot, but they can’t really lock it for real.


AUSTIN: And uh...yeah that sounds like them. I listened to that fuckin’ Fiasco game. I’ve been to Atlantic City. Two questions. One: And that’s it? And you’re able to get out of the entire zoo? Or is there like also—


ANDREW: Well yeah, and then I can unlock other people’s doors [Cross] with my hands— or my claws.


AUSTIN: [Cross] Right right, and then you just—  how do you get out of the zoo proper?


ANDREW: Uhhh… Great question. I— 


ART: I can climb over the fence!


AUSTIN: Alright, perfect.


ANDREW: I think— What is the most ridiculous exhibit that we hafta climb over the fence?


AUSTIN: I’m gonna defer to anyone who was in— so Ali. What’s the most ridiculous exhibit in the Bluff City Zoo?


ALI: The most ridiculous exhibist in the Bluff City Zoo is um… [Pause] Oh my god, what is it? I think it’s— [Laughing] it’s one of those that’s more focused on conservatory stuff that’s um… like, animals and stuff, and it’s an exhibit of a local chapter of the Bluff City Nature Preservists... Preservists?


AUSTIN: Preservationists, yeah.


ALI: Preservationists! But it is specifically a— it’s like, a bunch of stuff that they’re written out. It’s like the entrance into the— in between the entrance and gift shop are where the bathrooms are but it’s also like, here’s this lovely like, “we painted inspirational quotes on the wall that like, make you love nature.”


AUSTIN: God. Nature. It’s like, time dot is quotes, y’know?


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: “Nature’s slipping by. But it’s all around us.” —time dot is


[Brief Pause]


AUSTIN: So that sounds like two rolls for me. I need a roll from Snoopy Doo— a Criminal roll, that is unlocking all this stuff. Because that’s not being-a-bear. I know it’s using your tongue, but it’s not being-a-bear. So give me a— but, what are you? You’re a thief? So that’s 2d6 for sure.


ANDREW: Okay. And i just take the lower.


AUSTIN: Take the lower one. And you want under 3.


ANDREW: Is it 3 or lower or does it have to— 

AUSTIN: 3, um… [Cross] Equal or under so 3 or under, yes.


ART: [Cross] 3 or under


AUSTIN: So 2d6, take low.


[Bleep]


AUSTIN: There’s a 1!


ANDREW: Oh it’s a 1!


AUSTIN: You go through— you just unlock all those gates.


ANDREW: I’ve been doing this a long time.


AUSTIN: You’re a thief! Absolutely! So now we need a climbing check. So who’s climbing here?


ART: I am. So, I am also a climber.


AUSTIN: Alright. Perfect. So give me a 2d6. Climbing is a bear thing, so this is Bear, but you have three in both right now, so whatever.


[Bleep]


[ART Starts To Say Something But His Audio Cuts Out]


AUSTIN: That is a 2! So you’re good. You got that 2. Uh, so, here’s a question. Do we count this as Greed? No, this isn’t the plan yet— Hmm...This might be greed. “When the plan goes off without a hitch...” I think setting up a system for escaping the zoo reliably is...


ANDREW:  Yeah, no. Yeah.


AUSTIN: A success. So both of you go to 2 Bear 4 Criminal.


[Pause]


AUSTIN: So you have this system in place. Every night, for a week and a half or so, Snoopy Doo— using his incredibly long sun bear tongue— sneaks out of his cage and then unlocks the rest of you as well. You sneak through the Bluff City Zoo, going past the sleepy giraffes, and the abandoned “Dax Is A Hero” exhibit, past the still-painted black leopards, and the reunited lions. And you climb over the preservation and conserv— conser… Conservation exhibit, over the bathrooms, across the roof of the gift shop, and out to the marshes and highways [Chuckling] that are outside. I’m guessing you do this— I mean, is this a situation where King Charles is doing this every night to drive everybody? ‘Cause you gotta get there, right?


ART: Yeah, I guess so.

AUSTIN: Let’s just say this is the first drive. Is everyone going to the first scoping it out mission? Or is someone staying back to get some papers from somewhere inside the zoo?


ANDREW: I’m going


[Pause]


ALI: Um... [Clears Throat]


AUSTIN: Do we wanna split this into two? Go ahead.


ALI: Yeah, I think that— I’m the muscle, but I think I wanna stay back and look into this convention— this here convention.


AUSTIN: Inside the zoo? Okay. So it’s like— 


ALI: They have google inside the zoo!


AUSTIN: [Sighs] Alright. They say “Used to do anything not related to being a bear” so I guess I can’t say… [ALI: Mhm!] Maybe it’s like a big kids— [ANDREW Laughs] so okay. So we get those two sneaking out and securing your route out. You already made the climb, so let’s go to Randy and Snowcone/Slushie. How are you researching this? Is this like… You’re like finding a computer somewhere inside?


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh]


AUSTIN: That you’re big bear claws will work on? Is it like a kid’s exhibit? With like a big keyboard? What is it?


ALI: Oh yeah. Yeah yeah! It’s one of those—  we did a clapcast about this ages ago— but it’s like one of those keyboards that’s like a pillow [AUSTIN: Mmm!] that you [Laughing] put your wrists on, and it’s like, also a pillow. 


AUSTIN: But it’s big.


ALI: [Laughing] And it’s a keyboard. Yeah it’s big.


AUSTIN: Is it like a Cyber-Zoo exhibit? [SYLVIA Laughs] Like, [Laughing] “The future is all online, it’s virtual”


[ALI And Art Laugh]


ALI: Maybe it’s like— maybe’ it’s an extension of the Dax exhibit. Part of the Fiasco thing is that Dax didn’t get his own exhibit. I think he was passed over for a different exhibit that was pitched that was, um… “How would animals use the internet?” [Laughs]


AUSTIN: Right! Yes! Yes!


SYLVIA: Oh my god!!!


ALI: [Laughing] And I— [Laughter And Then A Deep Breath]


AUSTIN: I love it when a plan comes together.


[ALI and SYLVIA Laugh]


ALI: So yeah, I’m at the bear computer and showing how bears use the web.


AUSTINL: Okay, who is using the web between Randy and Snowcome/Slushie?


SYLVIA: Oh man. Uh...do you want the honors, or…


[ALI Laughs]


SYLVIA: Do you need me to show you how to use Google?


ALI: I think you as the like, rookie/leader— I think it’s you sitting at the desk with like, the papers all out in front of you. And it’s Randy leaning his bear arm on the back of the chair—- [ALI And SYLVIA Laugh]  and like looking at the screen and also the papers and we’re trying to figure out words from the papers to put into Google.


AUSTIN: Right ‘cause you don’t know...can you read?


[Pause]


ALI: I can read the word Honey...probably. [Laughs]


AUSTIN: Is it because it’s next to like, an emoji of honey? [SYLVIA Laughs]


ALI: And also ‘cause I’ve seen things labeled honey.


AUSTIN: Right. Like, cartoon honey box of things. Jars that just say honey on it yeah.


ALI: And I think that maybe we are able—- if you’re able to read “honey” you can read “con” and the numbers next to it, and I think we could get to a website to get like, information— 


AUSTIN: Wait wait wait wait! Let’s not talk about what you can do yet. [ALI And AUSTIN Laugh] Because someone needs to roll some Criminal dice. 


ALI: [Laughing] Okay


AUSTIN: Snowcone/Slushie, let’s see you roll a Criminal.


SYLVIA: So, that’s one right?


AUSTIN: Just one, yeah.


[Bleep]


SYLVIA: Got a 1!


AUSTIN: That’s a success. [Disappointed] Goddammit.


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh]


AUSTIN: Alright, so you’re typing away, you’re typing away. You’re getting more information on the honey heist— or the honey convention. HoneyCon 20 [Muttering] teen. While you’re getting it, there’s a setup that prints...Hmm, does it print out information? What’s the silliest thing the zoo could do?


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: I think it’s like, “Well animals— Screens are bad for animal eyes.” So what they do is a giant printout for whatever the page is, so that they don’t hafta look at the screen too long. And so there’s a huge— like singularly manufactured wall-sized printer. It’s like a dot-matrix printer and it’s like [Makes Loud Digital And Industrial Machinery Noises] [ALI Laughs]. And it’s just like, slowly printing out the entirety of the HoneyCon webpage. Which has all the information you need on it. [Resumes Making Noises]. And that is when you hear the sound of a security guard walking down the nearby path. Coming to investigate what the fuck is up. [ANDREW Laughs] What do y’all do?


SYLVIA: Oh boy...um...


[ALI Laughs And Then SYLVIA Joins]


SYLVIA: [Under breath] Shit.


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Snowcone! What’re we doin’? [ALI Laughs]


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Oh uhh… Wel,l we see him every day, so “get him” isn’t the right thing to say here. Um...


[AUSTIN Laughs]


SYLVIA (as SC): Could we desc— A distraction! Is a thing that the criminals do right?


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Ohhh


AUSTIN: I dunno!


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): See that’s why I looked to you— I was gonna beat him up


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Well yeah, but he gives us treats sometimes. He works here. He’s a nice guy.


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): That’s a good call, partner, Thank you. [ALI Laughs]


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): No problem. [Stiffly] Pard’ner.


SYLVIA: [Cross] Snowcone’s very proud of herself after that


ANDREW: [Cross] You gotta really hit that D.


AUSTIN: You really need to hit that D. You do.


ALI: [Laughing Hard] I’m so afraid of saying it for some reason.

AUSTIN: No listen. Ali? Ali, I need you to just be with me here for a moment.


ALI: Uh-huh [Laughs]


AUSTIN: I believe in you.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: I need you to give me the pardner I know is in you. [ALI: Okay] Just straight faced. Just bring it together. Put the— [ALI Laughs Hard] straighten out the cowboy hat. Straighten it out.


[ALI Laughs And Takes A Breath]


AUSTIN: Deep breath.


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): I’ll go distract ‘im pardner [ALI Laughs Loudly]


ALI: It’s fine [Laughing] Randy tips his hat. And I think that there is… Snowcone’s still at the computer I guess? Or needs to get to the printer. But I think that there is another—- there’s like another computer set up specifically for birds I think?


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah. Y’know what?


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh]


SYLVIA: Yeah that makes sense.


ALI: The bird exhibit is like a fake tree. Like one of those trees you can get for easter and it’s just a bunch of keyboard keys hanging off of it laughs.


AUSTIN: [Under Breath] God...


ALI: Randy just like,  slaps it off of the table that it’s on. And then like, starts like, bear yelling. Like, “Weehhhh!”


AUSTIN: So you’re drawing the attention closer? Or like, what is your play here?


ALI: Oh..


AUSTIN: [Stifles Laughter] Uh-huh?


ALI: [Laughs] Um... I guess I do that outside of this room? [Laughs]


AUSTIN: Okay so you go to another exhibit— another— you go to the bird part of this exhibit and make the decision that like, okay what you want to do is, do the...okay [ALI: Yeah] I gotcha I gotcha.


[1:00:08]


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: This sounds like Bear to me.

ALI: Mkay.


AUSTIN: Good love it. Gimme a— what’re you, you’re muscle? Hmm...it’s right near it. You’re strong you’re mighty. You’re trying to make a lot of noise. I’ll give it to you. I’ll give it to you.


ALI: Okay...what am I rolling? Sorry.


AUSTIN: 2d6


ALI: [Speaking While Typing] 2d6— oh, that’s a 3


AUSTIN: Oh, wrong thing.


[Pause]


ALI: [Quietly] Is that good or—


AUSTIN: Baaad. [ALI Laughs] You failed here, bad. Um, “When the plan fails—” So, “When the plan fails and you run into difficulty put one point from Criminal into Bear.” So, I mean, I think it works. I think you get the attention, right? It’s just like, you realize there’s only one way into this room, and... Jerome like, shows up at the— wait, didn’t we just use Jerome for something else? We did...did we? Maybe we didn’t. This is Jerome. Jerome is here, and Jerome is like


AUSTIN (as Jerome) “Ahh!”


AUSTIN: [Laughs] Flashlight pointed at you as you’re hitting buttons on this bird computer. It’s not an atomic bomb, this is a map, I promise I am not drawing an atomic bomb.


AUSTIN (as Jerome): [Terrified] Uhh...wuhh, you’re supposed to be in a cage! You’re supposed to be—


AUSTIN: And then starts to hit his radio.


AUSTIN (as Jerome): We got a loose bear! We got a loose bear!!


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): [Growls Pathetically] Weeehhh.


[ALI, SYLVIA, ANDREW, And ART Laugh]


AUSTIN: [Chuckles] What!? Excuse me?


ALI: That’s my bear noise [Laughs]


[Somebody Claps]


ANDREW: ALI I sent you a very important link in the Discord.


[ART Laughs]


ALI: “They may squeak, growl, bark, howl or huff”?


ANDREW: Yeah! [AUSTIN: [Thoughtful] Hmm.] That’s according to panda.org [ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Thank you.


ANDREW: Mhm!


ALI: The noise I was making was a growl, right? Like a [Angry Growl]


AUSTIN: [Cross] No, that was a growl.


ART: [Cross] That’s not the noise you made [Laughs]


[ALI Laughs Hard]


AUSTIN: It’s a different— Yeah, uh-huh


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: What’s your response to this? There’s a person here who has a flashlight on you. And also, who is probably going for his bear mace.


ALI: [Takes Breath] I… Hmm [Laughs] I— 


AUSTIN: And he’s in the door.


ALI: Oh, well can I run towards the door— it’s such a violent act, to run towards him— [ART Laughs Hard] and knock him down? But like, keep running, like, not hurt, but just stampede?


AUSTIN: But just stampede? Yeah, I— 


ART: No getting stampeded hurts.


AUSTIN: It hurts. [ALI Laughs] Is the thing, for sure.


ART: But also, you’re the muscle in a criminal bear gang? You’re gonna hafta be prepared to hurt some folks.


ALI: [Laughing] True.


AUSTIN: So what’re you doin’?


ALI: Can I do like, a very... specific shove? Instead of a stampede? Like an elbow-out kind of like…


[ALI, SYLVIA, And ART Laugh]


ANDREW: [In A Deep, Growly, Bear Voice] Excuse me!


AUSTIN: I mean, so here’s the roll then. The roll is gonna be [ALI: Okay] Like a failure here is— you’re gonna ge...You’re a bear. You’re gonna get past him. So actually I think this is a Criminal roll.


ALI: Okay.


AUSTIN: Unfortunately for you. Because…[Ali Laughs] Because you’re trying not to hurt him.


ALI: Yeah, okay.


AUSTIN: Do you see what I’m saying? [ALI: Yeah. Yep.] So that means you need a 2 or under, OR...OR, we can move one point back from Bear over to criminal if we do a flashback scene in which you and the other bears plan out the heist over some coffee and cigarettes in the back of a seedy bar. And you’re gonna need to explain to me what this scene is, where you’re prepping to do non-lethal damage. Like, is this a scene where you’re like “I know some nonlethal fighting techniques” [Laughs]


ALI: Well can this be— okay. Can this be a scene where like, instead of running out of the room I am making such a fuss that Snowcone is able to get away safely?


AUSTIN: Yeah but then you’ll still be in the room.


ALI: [Considering] Yeah.


AUSTIN: And then they’re gonna lock you down!


ALI: I mean this is— 


ART: [Cross] You’re gonna get bear maced.


ALI: [Cross] This isn’t the night of the— [Laughs]


AUSTIN: No it isn’t. But I’m gonna hafta follow the fiction, which means they’re gonna make it harder for you to get out. Which is a fine thing if that’s what you wanna do.


ALI: I got a whole team of people who can get me out, right?


AUSTIN: I— totally, I just want you to know that there’s going to be— I’m gonna hafta reintroduce escape— you getting out on the night of the thing as a thing. Which is fine by me. But..


ALI: Okay. I’m fine with that if everybody else [Laughs]


AUSTIN: Hey everyone I just need you to take a look at the screen really quick. Sylvia— ugh Sylvia— Annie— Dancy Nrew— has done some impeccable work here.


SYLVIA: [Excited, But Understated] It’s really good!


ANDREW: [Exhilarated] Oh my GOD! [Laughs]


ALI: Great to see.


AUSTIN: Great to see. Honestly? Just…


[ALI ANDREW SYLVIA and ART Laugh]


AUSTIN: Great to see.


ALI: Great to see


AUSTIN: Pardner. 


ALI:Kudos to you Annie.

AUSTIN: Kudos to you. So yeah, you can totally make the noise to keep the attention. Um, That again—- that will be Bear.


ALI: Okay.


[SYLVIA, ANDREW, And ART Still Laughing In The Background]


ART: [Laughing] Snoopy Doo has such a good face in this.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


ALI: That’s 2d6 again?


AUSTIN: Mhm. Yeah, ‘cause you’re muscle for sure. [Pause] there you go! That’s a success [ALI:Okay!] that’s a success for sure. So, do you keep making the noise or— I’m gonna say you managed to not get bear-maced. As Jerome gets closer and closer, you start to calm down so he doesn’t hafta bear mace you because that’s terrible and sad.


[ALI Chuckles]


AUSTIN: So yeah, Snowcone, you’re able to get away with your um...with the printout of everything in the— the entire website? So like, you just drag that back to your bear pen. And people think it’s just like “oh yeah that’s just papering at the bott— that’s just for where he poops— sorry for where she poops.” So like, they’re not gonna check the newspaper, basically, that you’re pooping on.


ALI: I thought—


SYLVIA: I’m pooping everywhere but the newspaper for the plan


AUSTIN: That’s exactly it! Touch your paw to your forehead three times, y’know?


[ANDREW Laughs]


SYLVIA: There it is.


AUSTIN: There it is! So… you get— what do you get for that? Also I’m gonna say that this is not the plan. This is not— Hmm...doing research maybe is, so yeah, “when the plan goes off without a hitch...” so Snowcone/Slushie move one point of Bear into Criminal.


ALI: Oh!


AUSTIN: Not you, not you Randy. You stay where you are from that previous frustration.


SYLVIA: Yeah you had a hitch.


AUSTIN: You had a hitch. And I don’t think getting out of that hitch is— gives you Greed. But Snowcone, you got what you needed here. Um...okay. [Typing]


[Pause]


AUSTIN: Here’s— ask me some questions. Ask me what you wanna know about this... this—from all this research that you did. Actually, let’s go to the people there first. Let’s go to the people who are scoping it out first. But get together a list of questions Randy and Snowcone, and I’ll answer then once we get back. Snoopy Doo and King Charles, you’re in the car. You’re in the parking lot. What’s the first step to driving a car if you are a bear?


ART: Uh… Get yourself in the seat properly.


AUSTIN: And it’s a convertible so that helps, right?


ART: Yeah, you get a lot of up-room.


AUSTIN: Okay,. So I’m not gonna make you roll for getting in. No doubt. No doubt getting in. It takes a while, you get seated. You get situated.


ANDREW: Am I getting in with you or are you pulling the car up to the entrance to the zoo?


ART: Well, if you broke me out…


AUSTIN: Yeah, no— You both went to the car together, for sure.


ANDREW: Alright, alright.


AUSTIN: What, um… I love that there’s always a fuckin’ ‘65 Eldorado convertible in the parking lot at the zoo, and no one knows whose it is.


[ART Laughs]


AUSTIN (as  Person 1): [Perplexed] “There’s always that convertible in the parking lot!”


AUSTIN (as  Person 2): [Relating To Person 1’s Confusion] “Yeah, I know, it’s weird.”


AUSTIN: You get in— Is it like a drive— is it a remote start? Like, what is the…


ART: It’s a 1965 car, it doesn’t have a remote start.


AUSTIN: Maybe you got it added because you’re a bear


ANDREW: Yeah you got all that dice money.


AUSTIN: Yeah, you’re gonna put a key in there?


ART: [As If Stating The Obvious] Yeah.


AUSTIN: Alright, it takes a while. Do you use your hand or your mouth?


ART: [Still Speaking As If Stating The Obvious] It’s a paw-thing. [AUSTIN: Is it?] It’s how humans do it.


AUSTIN: [Acquiescing] Okay…


ART: [Sounds Of A Car Failing To Turnover]


AUSTIN: Incompetent. Great work. Snoopy Doo, it’s just taking a while to get this car going.


ANDREW: I’m just chillin’ in the back seat.


AUSTIN: Alright you’re good. Are you like, laid out in the back seat?


ANDREW: Aw hell yeah, it’s so comfy!


AUSTIN: [Impressed] Damn....You smokin’ one of them Black & Tans?


[SYLVIA, ANDREW, And AUSTIN Laugh]


AUSTIN: It ain’t no problem.


ANDREW: Yeah sure. Sure.


AUSTIN: [Laughs Hard] I can’t believe I face cast this bear as Shannon Sharpe.


[Everyone Laughs Hard]


[ANDREW And ART Both Take A Deep Breath]


AUSTIN: The… Alright, so you get the car goin’. Now. Here’s what you know: there are three major roads out Bluff City into the mainland, into greater Bluff County. There is— didn’t we name these at some point? The real ones that are like, the White Horse Pike, and the Black Horse Pike— I think we ended up doing chess names or something, it was like King Drive and Qu— or maybe it was the suits, wasn’t it? We ended up doing like, Diamond and Hearts or something? Or Red and Black. Something like that? Red Card Pike and Black Card Pike? Turnpike? So I think that’s what it was. So, you know the Red Card Pike goes toward Yolk Harbor. You know there’s a Bluff City Expressway which is like, a highway that just goes out towards Philly eventually and Trenton and all those. And the Black Card Pike, goes also to the mainland but in a different direction. You know that there is no security. There is no, like, tolls on either of the turnpikes, but the expressway, which is that middle one— that long straight middle one— that goes the fastest, but there is, like an easy pass/...y’know toll. There’s a toll there. So it’s one of those things where like, if you go the big, fast place there’s one really hard stop, where you’re going to have to put change into a thing— You do not have an easy pass— I am not giving you an easy pass, you do not have a credit card to set up an easy pass. If you want to get that set up, we’ll talk about it, but that will be rolls.


ART: If only we had a hacker. [Chuckles]


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: [Laughing] If only you’d gotten a hack— oh, god, there is one! There is a hacker role. If only/. Maybe Slushie can multi-class. [ALI And SYLVIA Laugh] So it’s like, if you stay on the highway, you can go faster and it’ll be less of a chance to run into new people except for the toll booth. If you take the turnpikes, you’re just in neighborhoods , so there’s like people around, but there’s no place that means you HAVE to stop. So what are you taking here? [ART: Uh...] You takin’ one of the highways, or one of the local roads? The turnpikes?


ART: We’re taking the local road.


AUSTIN: Okay you’re taking the R— I’m just gonna make it red, that’s gonna help. Uh... [Typing] there, we, go! Boop! It’s red now. So, you get going. You get started. Let’s give me a Criminal roll for getting to yolk harbor without getting noticed. You wanna get under a... what? Under a four.


ART: Snake Eyes!


AUSTIN: “That’s what I was rolling when I got the sc—- wait a second, no.”


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Alright. So you, uh….fuck what does this look like Art? Can you explain what this looks like?


ART: Okay yeah. Um, you ever seen the opening scene of Kill Bill vol.2? 


AUSTIN: Yeah, of course I’ve see— we saw it together, we saw at a thea— [Exasperated] okay…


ART: Well, not you. The global you.


AUSTIN: “You!” You said “you.”


ART: “You,” the listener.


AUSTIN: [Mockingly] “‘You’ the listener—” Okay... Tell me what that scene is like if you hav— What if I haven’t seen it, then?


ART: Okay, so: It’s black and white. [AUSTIN Laughs] And uh—  [Laughs] It’s Uma Thurman driving, um… And the back is very clearly uh… not real, it’s a greenscreen or whatever.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: However they make that work— movie magic. Um—


AUSTIN: [Chuckles] Real quick— you finish.


ART: Just Uma Thurman looking at the camera doing a monologue about what happened in the first Kill Bill movie.


AUSTIN: Right, yeah.


ART: While some cool music plays. [Pause] It’s like that but it’s a bear in a crown [Everyone Laughs]  and there’s a bear in a backseat.


AUSTIN: [Cross] Just lounging


ART: [Cross] But there’s definitely some narration of what’s happened before.


ANDREW: Just chillin’.


ART: Just lookin’ at an imaginary camera.


AUSTIN: Perfect...God...


ART (as King Charles): Been drivin’ for this criminal crew. On a world [Audio Cuts Out] honey. And we’re finally… [ALI Laughs] Gonna get our revenge.


AUSTIN: [Laughs] Okay I don’t know against who! Wasn’t really a revenge thriller. Rowan BG in the chat says “one time my dad was driving on the New Jersey turnpike and turned to put change in the bowl and there was just a live crab in the bucket”


[ALI And ANDREW Laugh Hard]


AUSTIN: [Laughin] And in the chat Andrew Lee Swan says “Drive slow homie. You never know homie. You might meet some bears, so drive slow, homie,” thank you. And you just do it, right? Like you just— it’s late at night. We definitely get you driving past a cop at some point. Cop doesn’t stop. Y’know maybe we get a shot of Snoopy Doo gettin’ a little lower. A little lower in the seat. But you get out there. To Yolk Harbor. It is a week ahead, so you don’t necessarily see— like, no one is prepping for the honey convention yet. But I think it’s like— it’s prepping for whatever this week’s convention is. It’s like, a fishing— like a fishing tournament. It’s like a, like a small lake fishing tournament, that they’re setting up for. And so you get the basic gist of what the security is, right? It is a, um… So it’s— there’s a big single building that’s like a converted um… You know how like, a dock will have an interior— will have like a— it’s almost like a boat garage that’s on the water? Do you know what I’m talking about? Sort of? Do you sort of know what I’m talking about?


SYLVIA: [Unsure] Kind of?


ANDREW: Run it by me again.


AUSTIN: It’s like, a, “What if there was a boat garage?”


ANDREW: Okay.


AUSTIN: [Typing] I’ve done a search for a “boat garage” on Tw— on YouTube—


ANDREW: So it’s like a dock but it has an enclosed—


AUSTIN: It’s like, an enclosed dock. That’s probably the right phrasing, probably.


Amdo: Okay yeah. Yeah yeah.


AUSTIN: It’s like one of those, but it’s big. It’s bigger than— It’s sizeable, it’s like— there’s one here: “Grand Lake Used Dock photos—” Wow, it’s like. Look at all these used docks you can buy.


ANDREW: Fancy! It’s like— holy shit.


AUSTIN: It’s not like one of those— it’s like this 15,000 dollar one. I’m gonna put this in— [ANDREW: It’s expensive!] They’re very expensive. Um… “RhinoDock worth 15,000--” it’s in Duck Creek. We should just name this place Duck Creek. Great name. Does that say Steve Gaynor? Is Steve Gaynor selling a— what!?


[ALI Laughs]


SYLVIA: [Confused] What?


AUSTIN: Steven Garder. Not the Steve I know. So it’s one of those. And that, on the internal— it’s bigger than the one I just showed. Because it’s like also like, a flea market in there— on off-weeks when there’s no conventions or fishing tournaments, it’s a fishing market. Which means there’s enough space, but also there’s just boats in there. They’re just docked inside of this big, giant boat garage. And there’s also outdoor docks. And the thing is, that the convention is gonna be in— you know this because where the fishing tournament stuff is— is all gonna be indoor, like all the— all the...whatever. All the judging and people selling fishing rods— it;s a fishing tournament but also basically  a fishing convention, you know, people are there to buy stuff. And so, that's all interior inside of this place. And the uh...doors are locked. I guess, just— Do you pull up? You just pull up, there’s no security in  this place. You parked the car, you get out. There’s a fence. Um, but I think you’re able to just climb over, no big deal. And in this moment we have plenty of time, I have no doubt that with enough time, you can do that. And you get to the front of this place and it’s just locked. What do you do?


[Pause]


AUSTIN: Also there’s cameras, but this is the fuckin’ sticks. Bears come around sometimes [ANDREW: [Cross] Yeaah, of course. Yeaaah.] it's the perfect cover


ART: Yeah the perfect cover.


ANDREW: Hmmm


[Pause]


ANDREW: Austin, can I smell any of that honey yet? 


AUSTIN: [Takes A Breath] Um ...no. There is no honey yet. There is— you get like, just the tiniest hint of honey, actually. [ANDREW Exhales] But here’s the thing like, you— it’s so very potent, but there’s not a lot of it. You know what I’m sayin’, like— It’s like [Takes A Breath] Do you— what’s the spiciest spice you’ve ever had?


ANDREW: Uh…


AUSTIN: You ever get that real like, real hot stuff?


ANDREW: Uh… Like… I don’t know why— turmeric is not spicy, but that comes to mind that’s like super potent.


AUSTIN: I mean even more potent than that. I mean like—


ANDREW: [Speaking While Typing] What is the most potent spice?


AUSTIN: I don’t mean spice— I mean like, hot sauce, you know what I mean? [ANDREW: Oh. Oh yeah!] Like the hottest hot sauce you've had.


ANDREW: Yeah I’ve had like, some, y’know bullshit—


AUSTIN: [Cross] Devil heat


ANDREW: [Cross] Five-million ghost pepper— yeah.


AUSTIN: Right, yeah. Exactly. And so, it’s like that— you can tell, there’s not much of it. But it’s—  [Sniffing] Honey sense. It’s somewhere in there. You hafta roll to find and it and from outside, I don’t think you can do that. So right now the question is, there’s this door that’s locked. [ANDREW Sighs] And that’s the only— 


ANDREW: Are there any windows?


AUSTIN: Yeah but they’re really high up. Like really high up.


ANDREW: Like, not two bears high?


AUSTIN: I think they’re at least three bears high, which maybe you can do something with that, y’know?


[Pause]


ANDREW: Hmmm...


[Pause]


ANDREW: Can we just get into the boat side?


AUSTIN: [Coy] Y’know, you might be able to. Do either of you know how to swim?


ANDREW: [Cross] I think black bears can swim.


ART: [Cross] Not well.


AUSTIN: No, I meant none of you have the swim skill was my question.


ART: [Cross] but we can all— [Audio Cuts Out]


ANDREW: [Cross] Oh, but like...yeah


AUSTIN: “You could all” what? Sorry, you cut out.


ART: Roll Bear.


AUSTIN: You can all roll bear, that is a general bear thing.


ANDREW: Can we steal a boat and drive it in there?


AUSTIN: That would be a Criminal for sure. Not a bear.


ANDREW: Sure


AUSTIN: But you would be able to— King Charles would be able to drive a boat. Doesn’ t say you couldn’t.


ART: [Intrigued] Hmm...


ANDREW: We could also kick this door down, but I’m worried that they would up security.


AUSTIN: So what is the play?


ANDREW: Hmm...


ART: Yeah, let’s drive a boat in here!


AUSTIN: [Under Breath] God…


ANDREW: Yeah let’s do it! 


AUSTIN: Alright, so you find a boat that’s docked nearby.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Is it like a rowboat? Is it like an offboard motor? What is it?


ANDREW: [Pleading]God let it be a rowboat. Let’s just row this boat on home.


ART: Yeah, ‘cause you would need keys for a motor boat!


AUSTIN: That’s true. Yeah, okay. So it’s [Takes A Breath] King Charles, the black bear, and Snoopy Doo [Laughing] the sun bear— who is wearing a flat cap, I remind you. King Charles has a crown on— rowing a boat out across the lake. King Charles, give me a driver. Give me a 2d6— this is a Criminal again, for sure.


[Long Pause]


ART: Oh, my caps lock was on, that still worked, right?


AUSTIN: Yep, that’s a success! So you rode the boat out from the dock. Do you untie it? Do you just cut the line? What do you do?


ART: Yeah, just cut the line.


AUSTIN: Love it. And you just start rowing it out there together, out into the water and you turn around, you come back in. The— I’m gonna say it’s motion sensor or something. Or— you know what? I bet this thing has an RFID chip in it— that, as it gets closer it goes like “Oh yeah this is from the docks” if it’s raining or something you can bring it in overnight. So it opens up, and you’re able to go inside, you can see it’s all set up with the fishing stuff for the weekend. Like it will be Like the tables— like it’s card tables that are out, and the stalls are all empty. Maybe a couple of local vendors have already started moving in cardboard boxes and stuff. It’s basically empty— in fact, there is no security guard here— there is STILL. Though, a camera. That is watching. Um, and once you’re in here— Whew, that smell is almost overwhelming, Randy. Oh sorry, Snoopy Doo.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Yeah, I gotta get that honey!


AUSTIN: Yeah. But it’s almost so overwhelming that, unless you roll well, I don’t know if you’re gonna be able to like, find it, y’know?


ANDREW: Hmm.


AUSTIN: So, that’s a Bear. Finding honey is definitely bear-stuff. Right?


ANDREW: Is this…[Cross] 2d6


AUSTIN: [Cross] This is 2d6, yeah. Because of your skill, Because of your bear skill.


ANDREW: [Relieved] Oh it’s a 2!


AUSTIN: That’s a 2— it’s a success! So you like— you manage to like, figure out the— again, you think about a really, really, spicy hot sauce, and like, if you push through the heat, you can start to find flavor, do you know what I mean?


ANDREW: Mhm.


AUSTIN: And you finally do, and you realize, there are all these different stalls, right? But in the back left corner— the back right corner, let’s say. Of the big, um...boat? Like internal boat dock, there is a refrigerated, electronically-locked, steel room. Or steel door, on a room. And it’s like a vault, basically. I will now tell you that the two security features I’ve rolled are: “Electronically-locked doors” and ”’Impenetrable vault’”. Impenetrable is in quotes. But this is it. There is a big door that has an electronic lock on it. And I don’t know that it’s a vault in the traditional human sense, so much as it is an office— it’s a corner office. And it is Georgia Heights’ corner office with an electronic lock on it with a steel door. You could look in the win— there’s a window you can look in, and you can see that there’s an entire box of her BougBee Honey, right on the fuckin’ table. Right on the desk. And you can see behind that on the shelves is like, cases and cases and cases of it, because she runs the Yolk Harbor like, fishing dock, and it’s where she’s doing— it’s where she’s holding the whole HoneyCon, and so she’s already moved her supply in. Bit the rest of the supply, the honey from around the world— which who knows? Maybe some of it is even better than this bougie honey— is not here yet. [Whispering] But hers is right there! Hers is right there!


ANDREW: I mean, it is right there. Alright what does the store look like?


AUSTIN: It’s like, it’s like— did you ever have one of those big doors? Like big steel door, you know what I’m talking about?


ANDREW: Mhhmm.


AUSTIN: Where’d it go? I just had a steel door and it disappeared. There we go, there we go. Oh it’s too small so it won't— so it’s just one of those, it’s not anything special.


ANDREW: Like a big freezer door?


AUSTIN: Oh no, not even that. Not even that. Like one of those, like… [Clicks Tongue] Um… Just like, someone has like a— go ahead, someone had a way of explaining this that wasn’t me. [Silence] It sounded like?


ALI: No, sorry [Laughs]


AUSTIN: Oh, okay. Like a security door! [Typing] I was doing a search for a security door on twitter...or on—


ANDREW: You said it’s got like a keypad-lock-thingy?


AUSTIN: It has like an electronic keypad.


ART: But not like a bank vault.


AUSTIN: Not like a bank vault, it’s more like an office door.


ALI: Oh is it more like an Airbnb “check yourself in” keypad sort-of things?


AUSTIN: It’s a hundred percent like one of those keypads, yes.


ALI: Okay.


ANDREW: Alright austin, I put in the code “420”


AUSTIN: Beep Beep Beep


ANDREW: [Under Breath] Dammit.


AUSTIN: I know, good check.


[Pause]


AUSTIN: Yeah, it‘s like one of those here. This is exactly it.


ANDREW: Oh okay.


[ALI Yawns]


AUSTIN: Someone has linked in the chat bluffcitycrab.com


ANDREW: Mhm!


AUSTIN: Is this real?


ART: Uh-huh.


ANDREW: It is real! In memphis!


AUSTIN: We should go to memphis...


ANDREW: We should go to memphis!


AUSTIN: And we should go to Atlantic City, and do a fun team Atlantic City Trip, so we all have that to draw on. But also...


ART: Didn’t we have— [Mumbling] I shouldn’t talk about that in a live... [Trails Off]


[ALI Laughs]


ANDREW: Did you say there’s like, windows or anything into this room?


AUSTIN: There is. Yep There's like big office windows with like, bad blinds, y’know?


ANDREW: Wait, hold on.


AUSTIN: Yeah?


ANDREW: What’s the roof made out of?


AUSTIN: [Takes A Deep Breath] Damn that’s a good question... What does this bear know about materials?


ANDREW: I don’t know. Does it look like I can break it? Is it ceiling tiles or what?


AUSTIN: No it’s not even tiles, right? It has to be like some sort of like... It feels like it would make a crinkly sound if you walked on it, do you know what I mean? Like a thin metal.


ANDREW: Okay.


AUSTIN: I don’t think this is well-insulated.


ANDREW: ‘Cause I was thinking that what if—  you know— climb over this door.


AUSTIN: Ohh, right ‘cause I’m imagining this as like a really high ceiling. It has [Laughing] a really high ceiling in the overall like… like the building has a high ceiling— a high roof, rather. But this office doesn’t. Right? ‘Cause this office is like, a low office. It’s like a low, flea market stall, right? That’s just been converted into an office. It might not have a roof at all. It might just have kind of a tall ceiling [Laughs] Or a tall wall.


[SYLVIA Laughs]


ANDREW: Great. Yeah I’m gettin’ in there.


AUSTIN: Um... Alright.


ANDREW: This is what she gets for going for that loft apartment style.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh, totally. A hundred percent. Give me a Bear.


ANDREW: It’s not bear-proof.


AUSTIN: it’s not bear proof. You’re not the one with the good climb though.


ANDREW: No. No I’m not.


AUSTIN: Um, and your Bear right now is only a 2. Do you wanna— I guess you don't’ have any honey to eat, yeah, right?


ANDREW: No?


AUSTIN: And you wanna do this? You don’t want King Charles to do this, who’s good at climbing? Okay, I guess you’re the—


ANDREW: I mean… [Pause] So, on one hand, that would make sense. But on the other hand, I sense that honey. And I’m Snoopy Doo.


AUSTIN: You are Snoopy Doo. Alright.


[SYLVIA And ART Laughs]


AUSTIN: I guess it’s gonna be— give me one Bear roll.


[Bleep]


ANDREW: Nope.


AUSTIN: No,no. You just can’t get up there. In fact, as you start to get up there, there’s a...I think it’s one of those things where your claws just can’ t get into the side here. It makes a loud creaking— or a loud scratching noise. And that sets off a motion sensor, inside of her little office. So that’s why she doesn't have a ceiling. She has a motion sensor. And it just starts going 


AUSTIN (as Alarm): ALARM! ALARM! ALARM! STAY WHERE YOU ARE! THE POLICE HAVE BEEN CALLED! [ANDREW: Oh, shit.] REMAIN SEATED! THE POLICE ARE COMING TO ARREST YOU!


ANDREW: I sit down, I sit down. Really quick. I sit down.


ART (as King Charles): that’s your pl— let’s get outta here!


[ALI Laughs]


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): But there’s the honey! It’s right there!


ART (as King Charles): You’re not gonna get it! The police are gonna get you!


AUSTIN (as Alarm): THE POLICE ARE GOING TO GET YOU! PLEASE STAY WHERE YOU ARE!


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Just, just...let’s just kick the door down and let’s get this honey!


AUSTIN (as Alarm): ALARM! ALARM!


ART (as King Charles): [Skeptical] You’re gonna kick the wall in?


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Yeah! We’re bears, man!


[Pause]


AUSTIN: What do you do?


ART: Um… I think Charles books it.


AUSTIN: Alright, so you’re just gettin’ the fuck out. Are you going to the boat? Are you just going fast row or are you gonna try to go through the door? Are you looking for an emergency exit or something


ART: I don’t think the police are gonna think that the bear in the rowboat is responsible for the—


[AUSTIN Laughs]


AUSTIN: Does that make you more or less likely to use the rowboat?


[ANDREW Laughs]


ART: More likely!


AUSTIN: Okay. So you go back to the—


ART: No one is gonna think that the bear in the rowboat is the same person as who set off the alarm.


AUSTIN: Okay, so you get on the rowboat. Snoopy Doo what are you doing?


ANDREW: [Hesitant] I guess I go with.


AUSTIN: But that honey smells so good. The honey’s right there. Alright, you get out, you get out. And you wait and you watch. And you know, and you’re rowing back and I think that it maybe hits— Hmm, one of you is a thief, one of you is a driver. Maybe I think King Charles is— Eh, King Charles is incompetent though. Between the two of you, you put together that there is an 8 minute response time by the police. Add it to the list of facts you know. Alright. And you’re able to get back. I’m not gonna make you roll to get back to the zoo.


[1:30:18]


AUSTIN: Slushie/Snowcone. What’re you— and also Randy the Cowboy— what do you wanna know from your internet research?


[ALI Laughs]


SYLVIA: Alright. So [Laughs] Well the first thing we need is definitely a map.


AUSTIN: Got it. Got it


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Get off the Garden State Park— or it can’t be the Garden State Park— eh, it’s New Jersey. Get off the Garden State Parkway at exit 7S. And then [Laughs] get onto the Red Card Pike, and go east. And then— it says “You’ll see it, when you see it!”


[Bleep]


AUSTIN: That’s what it says!


ALI: Is there also a map of the show floor?


AUSTIN: Yeah it’s a flea market. So it’s like— 


ALI: Oh [Laughing] okay.


AUSTIN: It’s gonna be like, a flea market but its inside of a giant boat garage. [Laughs] What you do see though is like “150 different honey suppliers. Here in Yolk Harbor” And so you get to see like “Wow, that’s a 150 booths and each one is gonna have different types of honey or different types of bee supplies.” The other thing here is...um, Uh sorry, yes yes yes, Dre. You’re right. We do need to move a point to Bear for tripping the alarm, Yes, absolutely. So Snoopy Doo, move that point from Criminal back to Bear. Um, and I think, actually… King Charles, though— Mmm...It didn’t go off without a hitch. But I don’t think you were the one… [Exhales] I’m gonna say you're not the one who ran into frustrations here. You got out. Your part of the plan is the driver, so your part of the plan didn’t fail. So yeah. Okay. Other questions about this place? You get a map. You know where the best honey is, is what I’ll say. And i think the best honey is gonna be actually out in the northern end of this of this little, uh.. the boat garage. Um and also outside on the docks. Those are where it’s where the best honey is gonna be and it’ll all be stored inside for the night, In fact you probably find a page that says something like, you know, “”indoor storage to ensure your product stay safe and secure”


ALI: Oh okay.


AUSTIN: So yeah, all of it will be inside by Thursday night. In fact, you probably also see that that says, like, “make sure your supplies are all in by Thursday night at 11 pm. That’s when we go into lockdown.


ALI: Um, may we also get a parking pass?


AUSTIN:  [At A Loss For Words] You… You’d hafta r— [Sighs]


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh Hard]


ALI: [Coy] Hmm?


AUSTIN: You [Sighs]


ALI: What would I hafta do? That was not done? [Laughs]


[SYLVIA Catches Her Breath]


AUSTIN: I’m gonna handwave that we already established that you can get into that computer room and do this.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Here’s what I want. I want a shot of you practicing how to do this as quickly as possible.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: ‘Cause like you hafta do it without a hitch this time. You know what I mean? We cannot run into Jerome again.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: And so, we gotta get a shot of Slushie/Snowcone practicing the process of quickly registering for, and printing out, a parking pass. But yes, she can do that without getting into trouble.


ALI: [Laughing] Wonderful, thank you.


SYLVIA: She made a fake keyboard out of rocks in her exhibit, and just practiced on that [AUSTIN Sighs, Impressed]


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: [Sighs] Thank you so much. Perfect. [Takes A Breath] Anything else from this website. Or the internet? From internet team?


ALI: I mean, if we’re registering, can we have a Compass?


AUSTIN: I mean that takes t— do you— that’s a different that’s hacker. You know what? That’s the line between parking pass and— and uh, Compass. Which wouldn't even help you, you’re breaking in at night. [ALI: This is true.] Also, also..here’s a thought: you’re bears! [ALI Laughs] But you do have a parking pass. Parking pass is free, Anton. Anton says “how are they paying for parking?” Parking is free okay? You just hafta register. It says free “parking to all registrants.” Good question Andrew Kazune in the chat. What is the name that snowcone registers under?


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: What does snowcone think human name sounds like?


SYLVIA: Ohhhh maaaan. I thi— [Takes A Breath] Oh that’s good… I think that snowcone tried to write something like— she heard a name from someone in the park recently that was like… “Shirley Johnson” or something. But it came out— because she’s a bear and doesn’t know how to spell things— as like, “S R” she put in a bunch of R’s  because she was thinking that was the “Srrrr” and then… a J? Because she didn’t know the difference between what a j and an l was, and ie because slushie is spelt with an ie


AUSTIN: “Srrrjie. You must be Srrrijie.”


[ANDREW Laughs]


SYLVIA: Yeah. Shirley. But we spell it differently.


AUSTIN: Gotcha, gotcha.


SYLVIA: Umm... A lot of very— just a lot of consonants, basically.


AUSTIN: [Under Breath] God. Alright. Great. Perfect. Anything else from internet team? Before we jump ahead?


ALI: [Takes A Breath] I mean... this is a final call [Laughs] if there’s anything we need?




AUSTIN: Got papers. Got—


ART: Is there a section on the website about this special security for the— 


AUSTIN: No, this is her personal… I think there is just a whole page for Georgia Heights’ personal BougBee brand of honey. And it does say like, um…. “While tasting will be available, it will be limited to one sample ice cream— sample spoon per convention goer. You cannot have more than that, over the course of your three days. So ration it out.” That is the sample size for the BougBee Honey.


[Silence]


SYLVIA: Okay. We’re not gonna listen to that one.


AUSTIN: No, of course not. C’mon you’re bears. Alright, any more prep before the night of the heist?


[Pause]


AUSTIN: Also how do you explain— I’m gonna say everyone gets back safely. Snoopy Doo and King Charles, how do you explain to Randy and Snowcone/Slushie what you know from scoping this place out?


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): OH GOD it smelled so good!!


[Silence]


[ALI Inhales To Begin Talking]


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): [Very quietly] Okay.


[ALI Laughs]


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Good to know.


ART (as King Charles): We can just take a rowboat, it’s gonna be fine.


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Listen y’all you didn’t get up to any [ALI Struggles With Laughter] funny business there did ya? ‘Cause we gotta get the big honey pot.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): You...you coulda smelled what I smelled.


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Listen Snoopy [ALI Laughs]


ALI: Wait how am I gonna say this?


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Don’t put your head off the swivel. I need you focused.


AUSTIN: [Thoughtful] Mmmm.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): I don’t know anatomically how much I can rotate mah head.


[Austin Laughs]


ALI: Randy is just like, the two claws pointing at his own eyes and then to Snoopy’s.


[SYLVIA And AUSTIN Laugh]


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Randy?


[ALI Laughs]


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Yeah?


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Do you know why you can trust me?


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy) I do but go on.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Because I’m gonna bear my heart and soul!


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy) That’s very funny.


[ALI Trails Off Laughing]


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Thank you.


AUSTIN: [Quietly] Good conversation. Not a bad one.


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh]


ALI: I— there’s like...I feel… So, combined with the more complicated aspects of me getting out of here, and also the introduction of the door, I feel like there should like, a door-unlocking training montage.


AUSTIN: Okay. What...what’s that look like? [ALI Laughs] And we can do this— this can shift to anyone’s point into Criminal at this point if you wanna do that


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): What if—


AUSTIN: Uh-huh?


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): What if we just drive a car into the side of the garage? Get that honey. And then get in a boat? 


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie: That would hurt the honey


ART (as King Charles): Ain't drivin my car into the side of no garage I’ll tell you that.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): [Cross] It is a nice car.


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): We can’t risk this honey [Pause] Snoopy Doo, you’re...Listen: we’ll make the plan.


[ALI Laughs]


ALI: I think that maybe there is [Laughs] there’s like, also a safe room at the zoo. And we like, break into it every night, Just to like, see.


[Silence]


ALI: [Laughs] That doesn’t make sense.


ART: How does that help us break a number code door?


[AUSTIN Laughs Hard]


SYLVIA: To be fair...bear ha—- paws, not hands. Paws— bear paws aren’t exactly built for...


AUSTIN: Electronic locks. No, not so much.


ANDREW: Aw fuck. I just— man— I just figured out how I get the code for this lock.


ALI: Oh?


AUSTIN: How do you do this?


ANDREW: Georgia Heights.


AUSTIN: Yeah?

ANDREW: She’s got the code right?


AUSTIN: [Cautious] She does have the code...


ANDREW: I bet when she—


ART: Please don’t say “seduce her,” please don’t say “seduce her.”


ANDREW: [Off-Put] No, god. 


[ALI And AUSTIN Laugh]


ANDREW: I'm a bear, not an animal.


AUSTIN: Okay.


SYLVIA: [Beneath Laughter] Fuck off
AUSTIN: Good.


ART: Some people like bears, so…


[ALI, SYLVIA, ANDREW, And AUSTIN Laugh Hard]


ANDREW: Wocka wocka! [Takes A Breath] Fozzie Bear says that.


SYLVIA: Yeah


AUSTIN: Yeah, he does. He’s another bear [Laughs]


[ALI Laughs]


SYLVIA: Really on-brand.


ANDREW: I bet— I bet… y’know she’s in there. Working with that honey all day. She probably has that honey residue on her hands.


AUSTIN: She got that sticky fingers.


[ALI Gasps]


ANDREW: I could just sniff out which numbers she punching in.


AUSTIN: Yeah. I think this just comes to you in the middle of the night one night between now and the heist. You’re just like, laying down and on whatever the bed is— the ground? The ground— and you’re looking up at the stars thinking about ”I gotta get that honey” and it like, comes to you in a flash. You realize you sense some extra honey on the keys and you don’t know for sure. but you think that if you could get back there, you can sense what the keycode is. And you’re beating yourself up for not seeing it— you were honey-crazed y’know?


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: So yeah, I think that’ll work. Cool. Anything else before it’s heist night?


[Silence]


AUSTIN: So I think it’s heist night.


ALI: Yeah we don’t need disguises, we have hats already, so we’re good to go. [Laughs]


AUSTIN: So, tonight is the night you all escape— oh wait, you don’t all escape from your cages.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Very easily, we get Snoopy Doo— you unlock that cage. You take a step back. You're already smelling for that honey.


ANDREW: Well I gotta use my tongue to open the lock.


AUSTIN: Yeah, of course. Well you don’t hafta roll for it because we’ve already established that we did for you already. King Charles you get freed by Snoopy Doo, same with you Snowcone/Slushie. But um... they did something finally. On Randy the Cowboy’s cage. They turned the key, Randy’s locked in there right now. What do you do?


ALI: Um…


AUSTIN: And the three of you are waiting there at Randy the Cowboy’s gate like “wha— did they change the lock?”


[ALI Laughs]


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Y’all bears don’t have a lockpick?


[ALI Laughs Hard]


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): I mean, I use mah tongue.


AUSTIN: You're trying it doesn't work. It’s locked. There’s a gate between you and them.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Ugh, it tastes terrible.


AUSTIN: It’s real bad. It’s one of those new anti-tongue locks.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Yeah, the guy who does my lock he eat Cheetos so it’s kinda nice when I unlock my lock.


ALI: What kinda structure are we looking at with this door? Where is the latches?


AUSTIN: I don’t know. You’re the zoo expert. You tell me.


ALI: Oh yeah. Um… Can I— you know— ‘cause I’m the muscle I think I can break outta here.


AUSTIN: Bend Bars Lift Gates, yeah.


ALI: Yeah [Laughs]


AUSTIN: Uh-huh. This is Bear


ALI: Um, yeah.


AUSTIN: “Strong and Mighty” Roll 2d6, under 4.


ALI: Under 4?


AUSTIN: Under a 4. Your Bear is 4.


[Bleep]


AUSTIN: 3. you got it.


ALI: [Quietly] Yessss


AUSTIN: Tell me what it looks like as you break out of your gate.


ALI: [Laughs] Okay. I think that it’s, um...I don’t know doors. [Laughing] It’s like it’s like a gate with a padlock with a chain around it.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh?


ALI: It’s just like, a firm like, run into the door.


AUSTIN: [Impressed] Damn.


ALI: Chain snaps.


AUSTIN: [Quiet And Impressed] Damn.


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Do you straighten out your cowboy hat afterwards?


ALI: Of course.


AUSTIN: Perfect. Randy is ready to go. You all sneak out over the c— whatever, the cyber-animal room. Across the conservation zone. Over the gift shop. Into the parking lot. And into King Charles’s beautiful, red 1965 Cadillac Eldorado convertible. Question number one: Is there enough room for four bears in this thing?


ART: It’s a big car!


ALI: Yeah!


ANDREW: We might bear-ily fit


AUSTIN: Boo!


ART: It’s a long body Cadillac.


[ANDREW Laughs Hard]


AUSTIN: Boo! [Takes A Breath] Alright. Now it’s time to do the drive again.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: ‘Cause now there’s four bears and I’m gonna say that the situation has changed. King Charles? Can i get a Criminal roll? As you pull out of the parking lot. And I think that— what time are you going? What time are you trying to get there by?


ART: Uh, 10:15?


AUSTIN: 10:15, perfect. Oh, 10—  I wanna say, a thing  we already established— 


ALI: 11:15


AUSTIN: Thank you. Good job ALI.


[ALI Laughs]


ART: But it’s a lockdown at 11, so I thought that we'd wanna get there before the lockdown.


AUSTIN: Yeah but this is a good debate tot haver ‘cause—


ALI: Well we wanna wait until there’s no one there. We didn’t spend so long talking about this lock to walk in when there’s people there.


ART: Well what if we get in there before the lockdown and we hide. And then they lock it down and we come out.


Ali Ohhh. That’s risky!


ART: It’s all risky!


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Slushie, do you have any feelings of this stuff as the bear leader?


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Now...It is risky, is the thing.


[Snoopy Doo Grunts In Agreement]


ART (as King Charles): Which one are you talking about?


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Yes.


[ALI, ANDREW, And AUSTIN Laugh]


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): I am talking about it all. It is risky. [AUSTIN: She’s so pure!] And I think… I think what we’re gonna hafta do...Okay, what we’re gonna hafta— let’s go n— at— it’s a— we can get there by 10:30. Right? Okay.


[ALI And AUSTIN Laugh]


AUSTIN: Alright. King Charles give me a Criminal. Sounds like you’re gonna get there while there might still be people there, depending on this roll


[Bleep]


AUSTIN: That is a 3, that is a success. Alright. And I’m gonna need you to increase your Criminal to 5 and reduce your Bear to 1.


ANDREW: Jesus


AUSTIN: It’s goin’ off without a hitch! Four bears inside of a bright, cherry red, 1965 Cadillac Eldorado convertible take off [Bleep] at 10 pm leaving the Bluff City zoo, going east, on the Red Card Turnpike, towards Yolk Harbor. You pass five police officers on the way there. None of them bat an eye. It is, after all, Thursday night. And thursday is the new friday. [Quiet Giggles In The Background] You make your way past some suburban neighborhoods, and into Yolk Harbor, a commuter town ,and fishing village, where everyone there is anticipating the upcoming HoneyCon 20...teen. And you pull into the parking lot. With your parking registration, proudly displayed in the windshield. [ALI Laughs] There is— the lights are on inside of the convention— inside of the boat garage. And the smell of honey is In. The. Air. It is everywhere. There is honey in trucks. There is honey in cars. There is honey inside. There is honey in boats. There is a big boat of honey being loaded— unloaded into the big flea market hall, as we speak. I’d say there probably is a dozen people around. As a reminder there are 1e0 exhibitors, so a dozen is not that many, all said. I’m gonna say it’s probably like, five rows of— oh no, it’s probably like, ten rows of 15 exhibitors per row. And so that’s how it’s laid out inside. And y’all are in a car outside, parked. What do you do?


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Alright. What if… we get one of those tarps. We just put it over us. And then that way whenever somebody looks at us, we just stop. And we just look like a tarp?


[Silence]


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushi): Okay good idea. One detail: what’s a tarp?


AUSTIN: Shoutouts to Janu for more incredible Honey Heist art, in the chat.


ANDREW: [Laughing] Oh my god [Laughter Builds]


[Everyone Laughs]


AUSTIN: That fuckin’ sun bear tongue.


SYLVIA: Oh, good god!


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): That...its the— it’s the blue thing covering the stuff over here.


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): I like the idea to disguise ourselves somehow here ...but I think a big blue thing might stand out a bit


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Alright, Drizzly Bear, if you’re gonna rain on my parade, what’s your plan?


[ALI And ART Laugh]


ART: Oh my god…


ALI: Drizzly?


SYLVIA: Excuse me?


AUSTIN: [Recovering from laughter] Mhm. He’s a rapper from Toronto.


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh]


AUSTIN: Drizzly!


SYLVIA: Okay, it was a Canadian joke. I’m fine with that, then.


AUSTIN: Mhm!


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Well, I mean—


AUSTIN: Drizzly Drake!! Okay, sorry.


[ANDREW Laughs]


SYLVIA: Oh my god, what— where could we get…


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie) Could we, now, the— Could we use the tarp to sort of make it a— something a little less conspicuous than a big blue— could we make a disguise out of the blue thing. The big blue thing you call a tarp?


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Like...do you want like, a windbreaker?


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): I mean, I wouldn’t say no. I think it might look— we got all these nice hats, so...why not? Besides, the security guards wear them. Why don’t we take one of their jackets!!! Hey now!


AUSTIN: Are you about to make...okay, you know the security guard jackets— which are the same blue color as the tarp— would not fit you. So I think you’re gonna hafta do something better with the turning the tarp into jackets.
‘
ANDREW: We can’t find a super ripped security guard that would fit over a black bear?


AUSTIN: Maybe one. Maybe one. You could get one security guard who is super ripped. [ALI Laughs] Who is just a biggun. Who King Charles could wear that one. But the rest of you: you are not gonna— uh, y’know, the sun bear isn’t that big either.


ALI: Pandas aren’t especially big either.


AUSTIN: No, these’re— you’re kinda tiny bears aren’t you?


ANDREW: Yeah none of us are like, grizzlies. Polar bears are big.


AUSTIN: Polar bears are big. Polar bears— yeah exactly, Slushie, you’re gonna need a tarp.


ART: A black bear is only four-and-a-half feet and 240 pounds.


ANDREW: A sun bear is only four-to-five feet long and only 60 to 150 pounds.


AUSTIN: Yeah you could all- you could definitely wear some security guards— do you knock out some sec—


ART: You’d probably have trouble finding a security guard that small, even.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: [Laughing] Like a child security guard.


ART: We should've gone to the halloween store and gotten you a child security guard costume.


AUSTIN: You could still do a flashback!


[ANDREW Laughs Hard]


ART: I can’t. I can’t push my Criminal up anymore.


AUSTIN: Yeah, that's a bad idea Laughs]


SYLVIA: Alright, I think I wanna try and steal some nice jackets for my friends that can fit in them.


AUSTIN: Okay I think that this is a Criminal. And you are a thief. So what’re you looking for here, what're you looking— you're still outside right? Are you looking for sec— actually yeah, I think you find a van that says like, y'know, uh, “Green Felt Security.” And it’s like, a local security company, that’s been contracted to do security for HoneyCon. And I’m guessing that you can find that stuff in there.


SYLVIA: Um… Alright.


AUSTIN: Yes. Yes, absolutely. You do shift up to Bear 5, Criminal 1.


ALI: Okay.


AUSTIN: Because of breaking out. A hundred percent.


ART: No but it’s not what you roll, it’s if it succeeds.


AUSTIN: Oh you’re right! Sorry sorry sorry sorry, you’re right.


ART: The plan works.


AUSTIN: The plan works, you’re right. So you would shift back from Bear 4 and Criminal 2, to 4 and 4. Good catch.


ALI: Oh, okay. Perfect.


SYLVIA: Alright um… I guess I’ll just swipe some jackets from these guys while they’re preparing to leave work. Great way to end the day.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Give me a Criminal.


[Bleep]


AUSTIN: That’s a 4!


SYLVIA: Oh I got—


AUSTIN: That's success.


SYLVIA: Okay.


AUSTIN: That’s a success. So you come back with some jackets, plus a tarp, for yourself. And you go back to the convertible, which I’m guessing is parking kinda far away? Right? Like It’s in the parking lot but on the corner or something? I’m guessing?


ALI:; Yeah, yeah.


AUSTIN: Or do you wanna be closer than that?


SYLVIA: We have a parking pass!


AUSTIN: You do have a parking pass—


ART: We have a parking pass!


AUSTIN: Yeah, but you’re bears.


[ALI And Art Laugh]


ART: Bears in a car!


SYLVIA: And jackets!


ALI: Is it a multi-ground parking garage?


AUSTIN: No, this is a dirt lot.


ALI: [Laughing] Okay.


AUSTIN: That has every fifty yards, someone has a big stick in the ground, that’s tall that has a letter, like, stapled to it.


ANDREW: [Thoughtful] Mm.


ALI: Is there at least an awning?


AUSTIN: pIncredulous] No there’s not an awning!


ALI: [Laughs] Like attached to the building? No?


AUSTIN: Absolutely no.


ALI: Like if you were driving to the side of the building to put stuff in the—


AUSTIN: I rolled “rundown fishing village.”


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Not “lavish fishing village.” Not even “busy fishing village.” “Rundown”


ALI: [Laughing] [Cross] You don’t think there’s an unloading zone?


AUSTIN: [Cross] You know what? You’re right. You’re exactly right, Randy the Cowboy. There WAS an awning. You can see where once an awning was attached to a thing. No more.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Um… Alright. You all have jackets on.Snoop—


ART: And we look great.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: You look incredible. [Cross] You have security jackets.


SYLVIA: [Quiet] [Cross] Really brings out your eyes.


AUSTIN: Y'know what? Here’s the other thing you all have, is— I’m gonna, this is a little bonus for you: sunglasses if you want them.


ALI: Wow.


ANDREW: [Laughing] Of course!


AUSTIN: Aviators if you want them. Whatever you want, really.


ART: It’s nighttime!


AUSTIN: It is nighttime, but you look cool.


ALI: My hat covers my eyes, so...


AUSTIN: I gotcha I gotcha. So who has sunglasses. Snoopy Doo?


ANDREW: Me, yeah. Yeah.


AUSTIN: King Charles?


SYLVIA: I’ve got a—


ART: Yeah, I’ll do the sunglasses. Sunglasses and crown: great look.


AUSTIN: Snoopy— sorry Slushie/Sn—


ART: I'm ready to drop an album at this point.


AUSTIN: You really, truly, are. This is like, I’ve see notorious BIG in this outfit.


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh]


AUSTIN: Not the security jacket— he would never. Uh, Snowcone/Slushie what were you saying?


SYLVIA: I got the glasses but they’re tilted up like, out of my eyes, but resting on my head, because it’s dark out, but I like how they look.


AUSTIN: Agreed. It’s like a fashion statement.


ALI: I do happen to have a bandana, I just wanna say.


AUSTIN: Do you pull it up, over your face? Make sure you keep that honor?


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Just wanna make sure. Who makes the first move? What do you do? Got about a dozen people left. I’d say they probably left behind 3 sec guards for this place.


ALI: Is the plan to then… are we still doing a boat after this?


AUSTIN: I dunno. You’re the heisters.


ANDREW: [Tempted] You did say they were loading up that boat.


AUSTIN: They’re unloading the boat to go inside. Everything’s going inside tonight.


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): We ...We load that boat back up— get outta here, and we’re out!


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Hundo percent.


AUSTIN: Hundo percent.


ART (as King Charles): Alright so we should take a rowboat over to the boat and tell them that we’ll handle it.


[ALI Laughs Hard]


ART (as King Charles): And they can take off.


AUSTIN: Incompetent. Thank you whoever put this immediately, in regular Bluff chat. Thank you so much, for this Big Bear Doin Thangs.


ANDREW: [Laughing] I did, I stole that from Terrance Hector.


AUSTIN: Thank you Terance Hector, for Big Bear Doin Thangs.


[SYLVIA Laughing Hard]


AUSTIN: In the chat— just do a Google search— here’s what I like about this image: the letters? They’re honey.


ANDREW: Mhm!


AUSTIN: They’re honey.


ALI: Oh, are they?


AUSTIN: Oh yeah, they are. Look close.


ALI: [Jokingly] Would you take a look at that? [Laughs]


AUSTIN: Would you ever? [Whispering] God, just look at the fuckin’ sunglasses on this one.


[ANDREW Laughs]


AUSTIN: Just perfect. Perfect, y’know? I think zoos should be illegal. Bears should be allowed to live like this in their natural habitat.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: This is what a true king looks like, right here.


[ALI Laughs]


[SYLVIA Catches Her Breath]


ART: You’re gonna do away with zoos and—


AUSTIN: Free bears, yeah.


ALI: [Laughing] Tell the bears to smoke cigars!


AUSTIN: [Cross] I don’t have to tell them.


ART: [Cross] give robes to all the bears?


AUSTIN: This is what they do already.


ANDREW: [Laughing] Yeah, until we domesticated them!


[ALI Takes A Deep Breath]


AUSTIN: That album is an hour and 13 minutes, FYI.


[ANDREW Laughs Hard]


ALI: Good.


AUSTIN: Do you— can I just go over the list here?


ALI: Yes, please.

AUSTIN: Trap— did I say trap? [Laughs] Track 15: Chop It Up. And Track 16: Be Real. And then an outro. [Cross] You have some thoughts?


ANDREW: [Cross] Guys, the lyrics to Doin Thangs is not good.


[AUSTIN And ALI Laugh Hard]


AUSTIN: Yeah I’m not surpi- [Laughing]-sed


ANDREW: Uh: “I don’t care if it’s the first date/I’ll take you back to my place/We can skip first base/Because a playa like me tryin’ slide into home plate”


AUSTIN: He’s just tryin’ to be active. There's nothing wrong about— listen: I’m not trying to shame anybody who’s trying to do some thangs.


[Windows 10 Chime]


AUSTIN: I was hoping it was the wrong one though, I hafta say. I was looking to see if it was a different Doin Thangs.


ANDREW: Austin. How would you feel if I told you that “Your body lethal/And I might LA freak you”?


AUSTIN: I would be incredibly flattered.


ANDREW: Oka—


[Everyone Laughs Hard]


[2:00:30]


ANDREW: My name ain’t Apple/But they call me the Mac


[Austin Half-Scoffs, Half-Laughs]


SYLVIA: Boo!


[ALI Giggles Excitedly]


ANDREW: Also, this is all the same song.


ALI: That’s really good! You know what? If Kanye said that, I’d say “that’s genius” [Laughs]


AUSTIN: You— yep. Uh-huh?


[ANDEW Coughs]


AUSTIN: Okay. we’re gonna go back  to this right now.


ALI: Uh-huh, we’re stealing a boat, we’re stealing the—


AUSTIN: God... You know what I love? Is there’s this guest artist on this album, called 11-11 Boys, which I’m pretty sure [Laughing] King Charles is part of.


[ALI, ANDREW, And Art Laugh]


ALI: [Voice High-Pitched From Fighting Laughter] So good!


AUSTIN: [Laughing] Anyway, okay.


ALI: [Takes A Deep Breath] Um…


[Pause]


AUSTIN: I need to know what you‘re doing. You’re all in security jackets, someone needs to make a move here. I’m gonna default to Slushie.


ART: I presented a plan.


AUSTIN: I— what did...what was your plan again? Talking to people.


ART: We get in the row boat. We row over there, we tell the people loading the boat that we’ll take care of it. And they take off.


ALI: They should be gone by now, right?


AUSTIN: No,it is still 10—  it is— there are still people here.


ALI: Okay.


AUSTIN: You have not done enough things here since getting here at 10:30.


ANDREW: Mmm. I mean, if we— alright what can we do to make people leave?


ALI: Just stake out.


ANDREW: Yeah, I dunno, what is—


AUSTIN: So yeah, here's the window— I’m gonna be very clear: At 11— if you move now there will be security measures that are not in place.


ANDREW: Mmm.


AUSTIN: And if you wait until 11 they will be in place.


ANDREW: Okay


ART: That’s what I’m sayin’! There’s only a few people in the docks. We’ll just be like ‘we’re your relief, take off. We’re the night crew for the unloading”


ANDREW: You mean:


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Graaughh gright greww.[6]


ART: Yeah!!


AUSTIN: Well save it, for if you do it.


[ALI Laughs]


ART: My voice on— on the dry run? I only got a bit of bear voice in me.


[SYLVIA Laughs]


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Now listen pardner, I don’t know if you knew this, but we’re bears. [ALI And AUSTIN Laugh] I know we got these fancy coats… [ALI Trails Off In Laughter] I can beat some people up but I dunno if…


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Damn…


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): I’m convincin’ them I’m a man [ALI Laughs]


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Oh! Beating them up can be plan B!


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): [Thoughtful] Mmm!


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Hell yeah!


AUSTIN: Mhm!


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Then I’ll hang back. You do the talkin’ and if ya need the knuckles I got ‘em. 


AUSTIN: Alright


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: You sneak over to the rowboat. It's a little heavier this time, King Charles. But you know— you’re rowing out there—


ANDREW: What if we split up?


ALI: [Under Laughter] God...


ANDREW: Three— or two in the rowboat, two in the front door. Or I’ll just go in the front door.


AUSTIN: The front— Oh, the front door’s not locked yet, ‘cause they’re still loading!


ANDREW: Yeah! I’ll just walk in!


AUSTIN: Mhm, you could.


ALI And SYLVIA: [Thoughtful] Hmm.


ANDREW: We’ll just confuse them.


AUSTIN: I like this idea— I don’t have to like it, it’s up to you.


[ALI Laughs]


ALI: So me and Charles to the boat. You guys go to the office?


SYLVIA: [Cross] I can work with that.


AUSTIN: Right that’s a good plan. [Cross] Half of you get the good stuff, the other half got the most stuff. Alright, who wants to go first? Let’s start with the rowboat plan.


ALI: Okay.


AUSTIN: King Charles and...who’s going on the boat plan?


ALI: Me and Charles.


AUSTIN: Randy? Okay. You’re rowing on the boat. And you're going up to the people unloading the big boat which is parked inside. The door’s open— the garage door is raised up so this big boat can park inside and um… you can see there are three people unloading— it’s like a river boat, basically. [Laughs] It is a riverboat— it is a converted river boat that’s been turned into a barge. And uh...they’re unloadin’ it. It’s a couple people. What do you do?


ART: Is trying to talk to them into letting go, a Criminal or a Bear?


AUSTIN: That is a...lemme just double check real quick… [Under Breath] “Bear: used to maul stuff, run, climb, scare people” [Trails Off Into Muttering] “Criminal: used to do ANYTHING NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO BEING A BEAR” it’s Criminal!!


ART: Alright I can’t roll this. Randy, you gotta do this.


AUSTIN: No it’s— it doesn’t— Wait, you can totally do this, you have a 5 Criminal


ALI: Yeah!


ART: But if I do it I hit 6 Criminal!


AUSTIN: [Suggestive] If you do it you hit 6 Criminal


ALI: But… [Laughs] Alright


AUSTIN: So Randy’s gonna do it? Randy you’re gonna talk?


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Charles you gotta tell me what to say!


ART (as King Charles): what I said  over there: “We’re the relief”


AUSTIN (as Worker): Hey uh… We weren’t expecting any other boats, who’s there?


AUSTIN: And they’re looking— it’s dark outside so they can’t really see. They see the hats.


AUSTIN (as Worker): I thought security was inside tonight, is there a problem sir?


ART (as King Charles): [Whispering To Randy] “There’s a report of a...of a— of a robbery! And we’re gonna take over the unloading.”


[Silence]


ALI: [Inhales To Speak But Laughs Instead] Um...


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): [With A Growly Bear Voice] Night. Shift.


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh Hard]


AUSTIN (as Worker): [Confused] Night shift?


AUSTIN: Give me a roll. Give me a Criminal. This is 1d6. Oh wait! You’re slick! Does slick help?


ALI: [Voice High-Pitched From Laughter] I don’t think so! [Laughs Hard]


ANDREW: It’s gotta help.


AUSTIN: “If you’re doing a bear special skill or something related to your role—” I don’t— [Uncertain] Mmm….


ART: No, that's descriptor.


AUSTIN: That’s descriptor, I don’t think it does, I’m sorry. I think it’s a 1d6.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: I think it’s a 1d6.


ALI: [Beneath Laughter] What if I do it cooler— what if I say— [Takes A Breateh]


AUSTIN: Go ahead, give me a cool— a slicker, bear-wearing-a-cowboy-hat-and-security-jacket.


[ALI Laughs]


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): [With A Growly Bear Voice] Y’all can go home


[ALI Laughs]


ANDREW: [With A Growly Bear Voice] Pardner!


[ALI Laughs Hard]


AUSTIN: That was prett— gimme a partner. [Cross] You gotta give me a good partner and I’ll give you a 2d6.


ART: [Cross] Hey, [With A Growly Bear Voice] parrrrgghdnerrrr!


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): [With A Growly Bear Voice] Listen there par—


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: I gotta hear it!


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): [With A Growly Bear Voice] Listen there pardner. You can hit the hay.


[Everyone Laughs Hard And Some People Clap]


AUSTIN: Alright gimme a 2d6!


Art; “Hit the hay” is go to sleep! [Laughs]


ANDREW: Yeah it’s what Ali’s gonna hit them with if they don’t leave!


ART: Hit ‘em with the sleep!


AUSTIN: [Laughing] Oh god, and you failed! You rolled a 4 and a 5. I gave you an extra one and you failed! Catches breath. One of them goes like:


AUSTIN (as Worker): Uh… He.. Hey, security?


AUSTIN: And one of them raises a flashlight and points it right at you, and you’re a bear in a cowboy hat [Laughing] and a security jacket.


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh]


AUSTIN: And one of you is wearing a crown. And they see that there are bears coming for them. Uh, Frustration. You’re going to need to move one of your Criminal points into a Bear point. Please, Randy the Cowboy.


ALI: [Voice High-Pitched From Laughter] Alright.


ART: Alright, I’m gonna try to maul one of them.


AUSTIN: [Appalled] Oh my god.


[SYLVIA And ANDREW Laugh Hard]


AUSTIN: Give me a Bear? Your bear is 1!!


ART: But I’ll fail and get a second Bear!


AUSTIN: This is not the plan! Mauling them is not the plan!


ALI: It was a plan B!


AUSTIN: It was plan B. Alright, mauling them was the plan. Alright Give me a Bear.


ART: Ohhhh!!!


AUSTIN: You failed, that’s good! Your Bear goes up— [Laughs] I mean it’s bad because...you charge one of them and try to maul one of them, and miss, and slip on the wet— the dock. And fall into the water.


ANDREW: Unfortunately for you Art, that man’s wrestled a bear once.


AUSTIN: Yeah just judo tossed you, like bop.


AUSTIN (as Worker): Gotchu! I’ve been going to MMA gym. You don’t even know. Brazillian Jiu jitsu!


AUSTIN: Also, it’s Mero, it’s Kid Mero, I don’t know why? Something of a Kid Mero voice—


[Everyone laughs]


AUSTIN (as Kid Mero): Work as security now. Come get me! BK all day!


[ALI Laguhs]


AUSTIN: Bx, Bx, Bx— what slander did I just do to poor Mero?


[ALI Catches Her Breath]


AUSTIN: Yeah, you’re in the water. Let’s go to the front door team, really quick. Snowcone, Slushie/Snoopy Doo[7].


SYLVIA: Right.


AUSTIN: You walk in the front door.


ANDREW: Mhm?


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: At this point there’s no one around, but there is the smell of a lot of honey. And you can hear some people setting up stands, but that’s about it. And you have kind of a direct line right to this door— this steel door. With a numpad lock on it.


ANDREW: Yeah, let’s do it, let me sniff this pad.


AUSTIN: Alright. You go over, give me a Bear roll to snif— Mm...Give me a Criminal roll to sn— Mmm… Give me a Bear roll. 


ANDREW: I mean, they're both 3.


AUSTIN: Yeah, they’re both 3. I mean it’s a perfect mix of both Bear and criminal!


ANDREW: 2d6 right?


AUSTIN: 2d6, ‘cause you’re a thief, yeah.


[Pause]


AUSTIN: That’s a 1 and a 3, that’s—  both of those  are successes nice work. You notice, you see what her code is. And it is 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9. It’s all of them. She’s gonna have a 9 number lock— 0, also. It’s 10 numbers.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: And she..they all— actually it wouldn’t work, because then you wouldn’t know which one it was.


[Everyone Laughs]


AUSTIN: So then you hit another thing. It is 1, 2, 3, 4, but you don’t know what number it is. You just hafta try them all over and over again.


ANDREW: Yeah okay fair. [Laughs]


AUSTIN: So while you’re doing that...I think … Snowcone/Slushie, you’re like, Rookie-Sense is tingling. Like, y’know— like, what’s that called? When...you have luck for the first time. First-timer’s luck? There’s a thing for that, right?


ART: Beginner’s luck?


AUSTIN: Beginners! Beginner’s luck. Words. [ALI Chuckles] It’s 11 Pm. You sense something is wrong. Two things. You know the sound of a bear hitting the water anywhere. And you hear the sound of a bear hitting the water, as Snoopy Doo is putting in various key lock combinations. Two: you hear something else and it sets you off. maybe because you’re not used to this sound that much. You’ve had honey before right?


SYLVIA: Yeah! Yeah.


AUSTIN: But you’ve never had it in a natural habitat— you’ve never been “Oh, I found some honey out in the wild.” Not the way these other bears have or— y’know. Genetically have a history and a mental connection to certain sounds being associated with honey, like the sound of bees, for instance. So now you hear this buzzing that is scary to you, because you don’t have— there’s something in you that’s like, you don’;t know what a bee is. “I’m not the type of bear that hangs out where bees is.” There aren’t bees there right? There aren’t bees in like, Antarctica?


SYLVIA: I don’t think there would be bees in the polar areas.


AUSTIN: No I don't think so. Um, it’s bees. It’s bees. And they’re angry. And you peek inside, past some of the blinds, and at her office, and you see that there is a big jar of bees on top of the shelf, with all of the honey. And it’s like, every time that Snoopy Doo puts in a new code and it doesn’t work, it shakes the door. The jar gets closer and closer to falling off the shelf. And finally—


ANDREW: So is that’s the Heat or the Dark?


AUSTIN: That’s the Heat AND the Dark.


[ALI Laughs Hard]


AUSTIN: We talked about in Hieron about how the Heat and the Dark is like a jar of bees, and the fear is “oh lid would open up.” So, this falls and breaks under your— actually you know what? You didn’t fail that roll. So it’s up there, it’s teetering, you hafta be very careful at this point, not to make this jar filled with angry bees fall, break open, and then go everywhere. In fact I think what you get is— we get the shot of, it’s not just one jar. Georgia Heights is so proud of her Bougie Bees, that she has piled them here, inside of— not just a jar, but like, I think one of this is like uh… You know how— you ever have an ant farm as a kid?


[Silence]


SYLVIA: No, but I’m aware of the concept.


AUSTIN: You know what an ant farm is?


[ALI Laughs]


SYLVIA: Yeah


AUSTIN: You ever see a fancy ant farm? [Typing]


[Silence]


ANDREW: ...no?


ART: No.


AUSTIN: Okay well that's fair. You ever see like— so sometimes they do a thing that’s like— “Oh look there’s a thing on top that makes it seem like there’s a farm y’know? Or like “” Oh it’s  a whole diorama up top or a terrarium up top,. And like, below it is the ant farm” This is like that. It’s like a doll house for bees. And so it's just like, a big fancy condo for bees, that is huge. It’s almost like— when I was a kid, I had the Ghostbusters toy firehouse playset. Which is like a giant two-and-a-half foot thing. It’s like that but it’s an apartment building, but for bees. And that is also on the shelf and also shaking. So I think we get the jar falls and breaks and there’s a handful of loose bees. But if this fuckin’ fake condo falls, there are gonna be so many bees everywhere in this entire place, and they are furious. They do not want to be here. They don’t want to have fancy honey, They wanna be bees. They wanna like their bee lives. They don’t wanna live in a bee condo, they wanna live in their beehive. So, you finally get the door open Snoopy Doo. There are a few bees buzzing around— not enough to bug you, necessarily. Slushie you’re a little more concerned…


SYLVIA: Yeah...I don’t know what these small angry things are so I’m a little nervous.


AUSTIN: So sweet. And I wanna be clear, you also heard a bear hit the water.


SYLVIA: Yeah also nervous about that. But I assume it’s swimming practice ‘cause I told them tips earlier.


AUSTIN: Yeah, good catch. Good catch. Good call. Snoopy Doo, the good honey is right there. Just boxes and boxes. Like crates and crates. What do you do?


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): There’s all these bees!


AUSTIN: There’s a few bees here. There are more up top. You gotta be careful.


ANDREW: Hm...hm…


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Snowcone!


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Ye--yes...hello. I’m here. Wha...what do you need?


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): What if we let these bees out, man?


[AUSTIN Laughs]


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Oka— I’m listening, but I’m concerned.


AUSTIN: I can't believe I spent 12 minutes setting up the angry bees as a problem...okay


ALI: But you also said they desire to be alive and free!


AUSTIN: IT’s true. It’s ‘cause that's who I am


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): It spoke to me!

AUSTIN: I'm always gonna side with the bees and not the beekeeper


ART: Beekeepers are good for bees.


AUSTIN: That’s probably true.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Snoopy Doo didn’t always live in a zoo in a cage.


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Oh really? I have.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): And neither did these bees, man!


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Okay...would...do we need ...I don’t— I don’t know much about bees. Do we need—


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): It’s where the honeys comes from!


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): I know that. Do— do we need to take them to the water?


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): I think they would drown.


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Okay, so not fish. Not like that. I know fish, that’s why I asked.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Oh okay. Fair.


SYLVIA (as Snowcone/Slushie): Okay, I don’t… [Cross] So these—


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): [Cross] We let these bees out! We let them…


AUSTIN: [Disbelieving] Oh my god.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): Fight back!!


AUSTIN: Okay..I’m gonna need…


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): They can cover our escape, man!


AUSTIN: Okay, I’m gonna need… [Exhales] It doesn't matter,. This is a 3 and a 3 for you Snoopy Doo— actually this is...who wants to roll this? I think it’s Snoopy Doo, this is your— Who’s rolling this? Who’s handling the bees and who’s handling the honey loading?


SYLVIA: Um...I’m gonna offer to handle the honey, because the bees thing was Snoopy’s idea?


ANDREW: Yeah, no. That’s fair.


SYLVIA: And they’re scary.


ANDREW: That’s fair. I can point out what the good honey is.


AUSTIN: Okay. So then, you point out what the good honey— I mean it’s all— all the honey here’s the good honey, it’s just about who’s like, running it back. Also where are you taking it?


SYLVIA: Uh…


AUSTIN: [Cross With ANDREW] The car?[8]


ANDREW: [Cross With AUSTIN] The boat.


SYLVIA: [Cross With AUSTIN] The car?


AUSTIN: [Cross With SYLVIA] The boat.


SYLVIA: [Cross With AUSTIN] The boat


AUSTIN: [Cross With SYLVIA] The boat?


ANDREW: You’re taking the boat out right? That was the plan?


AUSTIN: Aw this is...thank you to— someone… Emily J just sent in the beehive I have in mind. Perfect. Look at these. Look at these perfect, fancy 200 pound 300 pound or euro rather. 300 euro not pound, sorry— beehives. Look at this. It’s like this, but even more— like imagine it was on the upper west side.


ANDREW: Man…


AUSTIN: Alright. So then, yeah. Sorry, I was so distracted by this beehive. [ALI Laughs] who was doing the bee— or the honey loading and who’s doing the bee release?


SYLVIA: Snoopy Doo’s doing the bee— 


ANDREW: Yeah I’m doing the bee release?


AUSTIN: Alright Snoopy Doo, you give me. It doesn't matter if it’s a 3 and a 3. Again, right in the middle. 2d6


[Silence]


ANDREW: Is it a 2 or a 1?


AUSTIN: Oh I guess it’s only 1


ANDREW: Yeah, it’s only a 1, I mean look: I’d love the extra one….


AUSTIN: Yeah, I can’t give you an extra for thief or whatever your ability— sense honey?


ANDREW: It definitely meets my descriptor but I don’t think I get a bonus for the desc— 


AUSTIN: No you don’t.


[Bleep]


AUSTIN: That’s a 6! It wouldn’t matter no matter what! Yikes. Alright so...I think this is what we have happen a couple of ways here. [Laughs] First of all, you shift your Criminal into Bear. Two: we get Snowcone/Slushie, you’ve got a couple of boxes out, and you’re like loading them all— or are you loading them out one at a time or are you loading them on something and carrying them?


[ANDREW And SYLVIA Laugh]


SYLVIA: Uh...I—  [Laughing] I like the idea of using a pushcart or something around.


AUSTIN: It’s like a shop— it’s like a grocery store shopping cart. 100% you know what I mean? Like they don’t have— they’ve just taken— they’ve— this whole fuckin’ flea market area has slowly been stealing shopping carts for years— 


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: And when people say “you can’t just take—” “we just found this.this wasn’t from there. This was donated. They donate— someone donated this shopping cart to us. We didn’t take it” Yeah they—- okay. So, you have like, three of them on there, and you’re ready to push back the first load, and that is going to the bees— that is when the bees— they get loose alright, but they get furious with you also, Snoopy Doo.


SYLVIA: Aww.


AUSTIN: And they start stinging; at you. They get all over your face. You got a whole new beard. You got a beard of bees on you. But they do get everywhere also, and so I think this is a combo of things. You’re gonna need to deal with this bees all over you— they're furious. This is by the way what I rolled as the um...the “But little do the bears know: the bees are angry!” Meanwhile, back at the dock, y’know, I think, one: you can see Randy the Cowboy, you see Snowcone approaching with the big shopping cart filled with honey crates. And at this point King Charles is in the water. What are you doing Randy the Cowboy? And also people are screaming at you.


AUSTIN (as the Workers): BEAR! BEEEAAAARRR!! Itsabear! Security!!!


AUSTIN: And I think probably, Snowcone/Slushie you see a security person running this way now. Down a different aisle basically. 


ALI: Okay, long term goal is to help Charles out of the water. Short term goal— can I engage with the security guard?


AUSTIN: I’m gonna need to know what you mean by “engage”.


ALI: [Laughs] Well, I’m a bear! And I have claws, and I’m strong and mighty, and also I’m a cowboy, so I know a rough and tumble life. So I’m not above—


AUSTIN: Throwin’ down.


ALI: When I’m in danger, yeah..


AUSTIN: So give me the GD bear then.


ALI: [Laughing] 2d6?


AUSTIN: Yeah, a 2d6.


[Bleep]


AUSTIN: Yep, that’s a success.


ALI: Okay.


AUSTIN: So the security guards come running in with— probably not with bear mace at this point, right?


ART: Were they expecting bears?


AUSTIN: No, probably batons right? Or tasers— it doesn’t matter because you knock the shit out of them. One security guard’s running out at you— just knock him out. The other one gets knocked out the other direction. One of them runs— 


AUSTIN (as Security Guard): That’s my jacket!


AUSTIN: And [Laughing] you just knock him out. One goes in one direction off the dock and the other goes the other direction. Third one’s charging at you and you just bop him right on the head, and he just falls over. The people who are loading the honey have— are fleeing at this point. One of them pulls a fire alarm and [ALI Gasps] the interior sprinklers...do not come on. But they like, go to come on, and a little bit of drip comes out— this place is rundown. It has not passed the fire inspection in years— they just pay the fire chief a couple bucks to keep that inspection going. But! The alarm is now sounded.


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): We gotta get outta here!


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Snowcone/Slushie can you—


ART (as King Charles): Glub glub glub glub glub glub glub glub


AUSTIN: King Charles is underwater.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: And now there are bees everywhere.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo): [With A Growly Bear Voice] BEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!


[ALI Laughs] Again, long term goals: help Charles. How am I gonna— um...We’re on a boat. How big is this boat?


AUSTIN: You had a little boat, and you’re next to a river boat.


ALI: Like a river boat?


AUSTIN: Like a river boat.


ALI: Oh is there like...Are there big nets? Like—


AUSTIN: Sure!


ALI: Like a pool net, but on a boat, y’know?


AUSTIN: Sure!


ALI: I would like to attempt to save Charles, by like, reaching that out to him.


AUSTIN: I think this is a Criminal— using tools is a Criminal thing


ALI: Okay [Laughs]


[ANDREW Snickers Quietly]


SYLVIA: [Reluctant] Yeaaah...


AUSTIN: Give me 1— 


ALI: Is that a 1 or a 2?


AUSTIN: That’s a 1— [Uncertain] Uh...


[Bleep]


AUSTIN: Uh, that’s a 2.


ALI: Okay


AUSTIN: Give me that other one, you’re gonna need a 1 or a 2. This is being strong and mighty, you need to pull him out of the water.


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: So give me one more roll.


[Bleep]


AUSTIN: That does— none of those are good, unfortunately.


ALI: [Dejected] Okay [Laughs]


AUSTIN: King Charles you are bubbling— you are under the dock. It is scary down there.


[ALI Gasps]


[SYLVIA Gasps]


AUSTIN: King Charles what are you doing? Also, Snowcone do you put together what is happening here?


Sylvia; Yeah I think like, once I see what’s going on— One: I think I can hear the bear drowning at this point.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah definitely.


ART (as King Charles): [Quiet] Glub glub


SYLVIA: So, if I’m able to like— I don’t wanna steal if you’re gonna give Art the option to act there. But I— as a polar bear— I do possess the ability to swim pretty well.


AUSTIN: Yeah


ALI: Fair.


SYLVIA: So if I can jump in there and help my fellow bear, I would love to.


AUSTIN: Okay, also, really quick: Randy the Cowboy, you should shift— the plan B has gone off without a hitch for you, as the muscle, in terms of the plan— the plan there was “be the muscle”.


ALI: “Engage” yeah.


AUSTIN: So you engage— that goes back to 3/3. Saving is not part of the plan right? The plan has been this other shit.


ALI: Right.


AUSTIN: Related: I think Snoopy Doo you should be shifting the plan failing, so Criminal back to Bear again. Because of the bees getting out.


ANDREW: Yeah, I already did that.


AUSTIN: You already did that, great. So you dive in. This is probably Bear. If you’re just swimmin’. So give me 2d6 you only have a 2.


SYLVIA: I got a 2!


AUSTIN: Oh you got a 2! Hell yeah! Nice work! So what’s this look like?


SYLVIA: I mean, I like— you know how like… mother animals will like, grab their babies by the back of the neck? With their...


AUSTIN: Yeah.


SYLVIA: I think it’s a lot of that, where it’s just like— ‘cause i dont wanna — I like the idea of like...Charles has been shown laying around a lot. I think he’s really good at going limp. [AUSTIN Laughs] So it’s just Snowcone like, paddling out with him in tow. LIke, the scruff of his neck in her jaw.


AUSTIN: Love it. Perfect. You pull him back up on the rowboat on the dock and… King Charles, you’ve made it back onto dry land.


ART (as King Charles) [Sigh Of Relief]


AUSTIN: Snoopy Doo, how are you doing?


ANDREW: Bad, probably!


AUSTIN: Yeah...are you staying there? Are you getting out?


ANDREW: Uh, I think  I’m like...kind of like, running back and forth, like I’m grabbing some things of honey and just like… [Cross] Throwing it in the general direction of where I think people are.


AUSTIN: [Cross] Oh, buddy. [Laughs]


ANDREW: [Laughing] Like, [Cross] slapping at my face and my eyes.


AUSTIN: [Cross] I think we cut to, yeah. We just a solid 30 second shot of the aisles. And it’s just like, the aisles— the end of the aisle is the office, and we just get Snoopy Doo runs out of the office, covered in bees, carrying a crate of honey, throws it in the middle of the aisle. It hits the ground, some of the honey goes all over— not all of it, but some of it— you [Laughing] go to grab another one, go back out. Same single shot. Shot doesn’t move. There’s no soundtrack. It’s just the natural foley. It’s shot Dogme 95 sty— it’s just— throws it!


[Everyone Laughs]


AUSTIN: Natural lighting— it’s just miserable!


ANDREW: There's a doppler effect of a bear screaming at the top of its lungs.


ANDREW (as Snoopy Doo):…rrrrrrrRRRRRRRRAAAAARRRRrrrrrrr… ...rrrrrRRRRRAAAAAAAAARRRRrrrrrr…[9]


[Everyone Laughs]


AUSTIN: That’s where we’re at! Dock crew you can load the honey that’s already here, on the boat. The regular honey—  which is good honey—  and three crates of the great honey are on there. You don’t know where Snoopy Doo is. You have started to notice bees in the air though, as they filter out of this place


ART (as King Charles): SNOOOPY!!!


[ALI Laughs]


ART (as King Charles): COOOMMEE ONN!!!


[ALI And AUSTIN Laugh]


ANDREW: Are we leaving?


AUSTIN: That’s what I think that is, yeah. You're gonna hafta do something to get past those bees. Those bees are gonna getcha if you don’t make a roll here


ANDREW: Okay, um… [Takes A Breath] Well, what’s home to a bee?


AUSTIN: [Confused] I don’t know.


pALI Laughs]


ANDREW: It’s honey. It’s honey. Right? And there’s nothing safer than home.


AUSTIN: [Dissenting] I don’t…


ANDREW: So what if I just slather myself in honey [SYLVIA: [Quiet] Oh god...] to show that I’m just home and safe to the bees?


[Silence]


AUSTIN: [Under Breath] Okay that’s… I...


ALI: Excuse me? [ALI And ANDREW Laugh]


AUSTIN: Are you eating the honey? Because this is moving a point of Criminal into Bear.


ANDREW: No I think I’m just covering my face in honey.


Austi: Why would they l— so you’re just like ”Oh they’ll just calm down and sit on my—”


ANDREW: No they’ll just smell the honey be like “oh this is fine, that’s just home.”


AUSTIN: I see. Give me...


ANDREW: It’s like when, you know— you’re out hunting and you put like, the deer pee on you or something.


AUSTIN: Thank you to Lily for completing the thought I had in my head, but I couldn’t figure it out quick enough. Lily in the chat says “What’s a home to a bee? What’s a bee to a bear? What’s a bear to a nonbeeliever?”


[SYLVIA Laughs]


ART: Doesn’t believe in anybee.


AUSTIN: [Laughs] Alright. Give me a...I don’t know if this is a Bear or a Criminal. Where is this coming from inside Snoopy Doo? Is this coming from an innate bear sense, or this coming from a “I know how bees work. I’m smart.”


ANDREW: [Laughing] It’s probably the latter!


AUSTIN: Alright, that’s a Criminal. I’m sorry.


ANDREW: Which is why it’s not gonna work. [Laughs]


AUSTIN: Give me one die. Oh! Skill: honey sense. This is definitely honey sense.


ANDREW: [Laughing] Okay, sure!


AUSTIN: Two dice. Gotta get a 2 or under— that’s a 5 and a 4. Bad. Bad. Bad.


[ALI Laughs]


ART: Honestly, what was it gonna look like if it was a success?


[Everyone Laughs]


AUSTIN: You gotta be a fan of the players, y’know? Play to find out what happens.


ART: You’d be like “Yeah, yeah, it worked. Bees love honey!”


ANDREW: Shift another one into Bear.


AUSTIN: Yep! You are covered in honey, and also covered in bees. [Laughs] And they’re sticky, it’s— no one likes this, this is terrible!


[2:30:19]


ANDREW: So now I’m just rolling on the ground.


AUSTIN: No!! Oh my god. You can all hear Snoopy Doo. And the alarms are goin—


AUSTIN (as Alarm): Alarm. Alarm. Fire Alarm.


ART (as King Charles): [Gasp] Oh let’s hit the fire alarm! And the water will sto—


AUSTIN: We’ve already gone— we’ve gone over this, you missed this. You were underwater.


ALI: [Laughs] There’s none.


AUSTIN: The water doesn't work. The sprinklers aren't working because this place is so rundown.


ART: I do remember that, I was underwater/


[ALI Laughs]


ART: Fire extinguishers?


ALI: Oh...Yes


AUSTIN: Alright. I’m gonna need a Criminal. Y’all go find Snoopy Doo rolling around on the ground covered in bees?


ART: Well someone should stay with the boat, and it should prob be me, so y’all have fun with the...with the bee removal


[ALI Laughs]


ART: I'll get the boat running.


AUSTIN: Yeah that makes sense. Yeah, you needa— this is a big boat. This is a bigger boat than you’ve ever used before. So we just get— yeah. Y’all go back and we get a smash cut back to King Charles in the engine room of a big river boat.


[ALI Laughs Hard]


AUSTIN: And we come back to you— we’ll get that Criminal roll from you in a moment King Charles. Randy and Snowcone, how are you helping Snoopy Doo? Y'all get your fire extinguishers?


ALI: Yeah. Yes. That’s how! [Laughs]


AUSTIN: One of you gimme a Criminal roll.


ALI: [Laughing] This better be Criminal at this point.


AUSTIN: Snowcone.


ALI: Okay.


SYLVIA: I’m an incredibly good Criminal.


[ALI And ANDREW Laugh]


SYLVIA: 1d6 then, for this?


AUSTIN: Uh….


SYLVIA: I’m just spraying him with.


AUSTIN: Yeeaaah, 1d6.


[Silence]


AUSTIN: That’s a 3!


SYLVIA:  Yes!


ANDREW: Oh, thank god.


AUSTIN: Snowcone just unload— I think both Randy and Snowcone use the fire extinguishers. Randy, yours doesn't work, it’s too old. It’s dried out in there. Snowcone you point— some kids played with— Randy’s was definitely used for some fun game by some kids who snuck in here  one night. Snowcone, yours works and covers Snoopy Doo in very cold...whatever’s in— what’s inside fire extinguishers? 


ART: Uh...foam?


AUSTIN: Is it foam now?


ART: What is it? It's not like a gas right?


ALI: It’s been foam right?


ART: Yeah I think it's always been foam.


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Hm.


ART: It’s like a foam explosion.


AUSTIN:” I thought it was— yeah: “fire squelching agent”.


SYLVIA And ANDREW: [Intrigued] Hmmm.


[ALI Laughs]


ART: Yo someone write that name down!


[ALI Laughs]


SYLVIA: My new character, Squelching Agent.


AUSTIN: I hate it. Thanks.


SYLVIA: Yep!


[AUSTIN and ALI Make Noises Of Disgust And ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Alright so yeah that happens. So foam, bee, and honey-covered Snoopy Doo, you’re able to stand up and slowly walk to the— to the boat.


ANDREW: [Laughs Hard] I’m bringing my little thing of honey with me.


AUSTIN: Oh yeah, I bet you do. You each could carry one more crate of honey.


ALI: Nice.


AUSTIN: And you get to the boat and now it all comes down to this. King Charles. I’m gonna need a Criminal. 2d6— you’re  a driver. Get them outta here.


[Long Silence]


[Bleep]


AUSTIN: [Relieved] That is a success. I was so worried.


[Everyone Laughs]


AUSTIN: I was so worried.


SYLVIA: [Chuckling] Just drive it into the water.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: I know, right? You get it in the river boat, you pile it in. You know there’s a path, basically west towards the ocean—  east towards the ocean— west on my map because this map is backwards. East towards the ocean. And uh….like, down the marshes and in the creeks and the boat barely fits in down that way, but y’all figure it out. And I think we just get a wide-shot of the river boat. All you covered in honey. You can open the honey and eat it if you want to now. It’s the best stuff. It’s so good. We get to watch as it slowly pulls out the river boat going down the river, and you see all the fire engines rushing towards Yolk Harbor’s fishing docks. Just like, dozens of them, headed down that way. And you all make it back to the zoo, and the river runs right behind the zoo. I think it turns into a big marshland basically right behind the zoo. And—


ART: Wait, can I pitch you a shot?


AUSTIN: Yes, always.


ART: You know the end of Ocean’s Eleven?


AUSTIN: Yes.


ART: Where they’re all standing in front of the Bellagio Fountain? And it’s just like that but it’s bears and it’s just like— [Audio Cuts Out] the mist comers off the—


AUSTIN: [Laughing] Of the—


ART: Of the river, as the fire trucks go by.


AUSTIN: Yes. As the sun begins to rise...Fuck.


ART: Jars.


AUSTIN: Perfect. [Laughing] Exhales in relief


ART: And whatever that song was. It’s that song.


AUSTIN: We couldn’t license it, so it’s that but “what if bears played it?”


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Any other final—


ART: It’s the country bear jamboree cover of that song.


AUSTIN: Yeah, thank you. Yes. Are there any other epilogues for these characters as everyone gets back to the zoo and everyone gets back to their regular life?


ART: Yeah there’s an epilogue of a few days later.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


ART: When King Charles comes back to get his car.


AUSTIN: Oh riiight! Wait how does he get back?


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh]


AUSTIN: It’s so far!


ART: He gets a taxi.


SYLVIA: Gets an Uber


ANDREW: He gets an Ubear.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: [Half-Heared] Boooo!


[ANDREW Laughs]


AUSTIN: Booo-ear!! Okay so—


ART: No I think it’s an old checkered cab where the guy’s like “Yeah, okay. It’s just a fare. Whatever.”


AUSTIN: Holiday weekend. Get in.


ART: Yeah, you got 20 bucks? Great.


[AUSTIN Laughs]


ART: He doesn’t have a costume or anything. He just gets out of the thing, and like, scampers up to his own car.


[Everyone Laughs]


ART: Looks furtively around and then like… Just jumps over the door. [Laughs]


AUSTIN: Alright, there’s King Charles. Snoopy Doo? Randy the Cowboy? Snowcone/Slushie? Final shots.


SYLVIA: So… Snowcone’s gotten really good at using the internet.


AUSTIN: Yeaaah.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: You got a Criminal 5— you know all sorts how to use the internet.


SYLVIA: Yeaaah. So...she started a blog. And it’s mostly incomprehensible.


[ALI Laughs]


SYLVIA: But she managed to get— [Laughs] I don’t know how this works but she sends pictures of the tarp being used for various like, decoration purposes.


AUSTIN: Oh my god


SYLVIA: And her— in her pen. Also, she finally started signing with her own name, which is Sorbet—


[AUSTIN Laughs]


SYLVIA: But she can’t spell it properly so it’s just an S an R and a B with varying numbers.


AUSTIN: SRB! I love SRB.


SYLVIA: Yeah


AUSTIN: Oh my god. I think the zoo loves it by the way. So many people come to see the blogging bear


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh]


AUSTIN: Are you kidding me?


SYLVIA: Yeah! Of course!


AUSTIN: [Catches Breath]  Thank you Sh...wait did you say Sherbert or Sorbet?


SYLVIA: Sorbet.


AUSTIN: [Laughs] Alright, Snoopy Doo or Randy the Cowboy?

ANDREW: Hmm…


[Silence]


ALI: I have a— I wanna go last, so you have all the time you need Dre [Laughs]


[AUSTIN Laughs]


ANDREW: Snoopy Doo—


AUSTIN: 5 Bear, 1 Criminal.


[ALI And ANDREW Laugh]


ANDREW: [Exhales Loudly] [Pause] Snoopy Doo becomes a beekeeper.


AUSTIN: Wooow. Sustainability!


ANDREW: Mhm!


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Protect the earth, actually.


ANDREW: Yeah.


AUSTIN: So what’s that look like? Is that like, did you happen to bring back like, one of the like— one set of bee stuff with you?


ANDREW: Yeah. Yeah. There was actually— nah see when they spray me with the foam..


AUSTIN: Yeah?


ANDREW: They actually kept a queen bee, like alive [AUSTIN Gasps] in the foam.


AUSTIN: Perfectly— 


ANDREW: Yeah, perfectly preserved.


[ALI And SYLVIA Laugh] 


ANDREW: [Laughing] So I started my own colony.


AUSTIN: Out in the marshes, you sneak out every day…


ANDREW: Nom I just— I don’t got back to the zoo.


AUSTIN: Oh My God! You just don’t go back, there’s just a missing bear!


ANDREW: Yeah I’m Bear 5 now, man.


AUSTIN: [Amazed] Wow!


SYLVIA: Damn.


ANDREW: Can’t go back.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Can’t go back. You're Right, Bear 5. Bear 5 don’t go back to the zoo. You and the bees, you're livin free out here.


[ALI Laughs Harder]


AUSTIN: Shoutouts. Y’know what I’m sayin’? Shoutouts. Alright, Randy the Cowboy.


ALI: [Still Laughing] Oh not that ruins my plans a little bit. I had a very specific— I had a very specific shot in my mind which is like, we’re back in the bear bar. It’s just a bunch of empty cups, and it cuts to the door and it shows each of the bears walking out and it cuts to their epilogue and the camera zooms out and it’s Randy standing at the laughs tipping his hat at everyone who comes out. He got that full time.


[SYLVIA And ANDREW Laugh Hard]


AUSTIN: Oh my god. So yeah, I guess what we get is. What we get is the… we get the round table of Snoopy Doo, King Charles, and Sorbet being like… y’know it’s the first time you’ve connected backup as a group to like— since the heist basically right? I’m guessing you still go to the bar every now and again. Snoopy Doo? For this maybe?


ANDREW: Sure yeah.


AUSTIN: And we get the three of you going like “damn I can’t believe it all went down like that.” And I think someone— Snowcone, maybe—  Sorbet, sorry. You say like, “what ever happened to Randy?” And then yeah, it’s like “when we leave, you’ll see” and then we get the follow out shot of you at the door.


[ALI Laughs]


AUSTIN: Makin’ sure everything’s going good.


ALI (as Randy the Cowboy): Howdy ma’am.


SYLVIA (as Sorbet): Howdy!


AUSTIN: [Laughs] Scene. Cut. Print.


[ALI Laughs Hard]


AUSTIN: [Laughing] It’s time to pay the price.


[ART Laughs Hard]


AUSTIN: [Catches His Breath] Oh my god. Alright. That is gonna do it for us tonight. Um… you know what plays over the credits right?


[Big Bear’s “Doin Thangs” Starts Playing]


ALI: Hm?


ART: Bare Necessities?


AUSTIN: Sorry I just started playing “Doin Thangs” by Big Bear.


[Everyone Laughs Hard]


AUSTIN: I’m gonna turn this off.


SYLVIA: Paddington could never.


[Music Stops]


AUSTIN: Alright I’m gonna turn this off so we don’t get sued. [Laughs] Yeah okay. You can find me on twitter @austin_walker Where can people find you Sylvia?


SYLVIA: You can find me on Twitter @captaintrash I have another show called Emojidrome, it’s on  iTunes and Google. You can find it.


AUSTIN: Hell yeah! Ali where can people find you?


ALI: You can find me @ali_west on twitter.com. Two things: Bluff City 15 was just published, I just hit the button so you can go listen to that right now!


[Everyone Cheers]


AUSTIN: Nothing but content.


ALI: [Laughs] Yeah. And then, also Thursday I’m going to be back with Jack and Janine playing Shooting The Moon.


AUSTIN: Hell yeah, that games seems really cool. I’m excited to hear it. What about you Art?


ART: People can find me on twitter @atebbel People can listen to One Song Only [Audio Cuts Out] podcasts, we’ll probably get back to that now that patreon has caught up.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


[ALI Laughs]


ART: And next week I’ll be back streaming Hitman 2, with Jack over on Mixer— a totally real streaming platform, apparently.


AUSTIN: [Laughs] Oh boy, perfect. I love it so much. Alright everybody, that is gonna do it, as always, thank you for supporting us. If someone has been like “no, sit down. You have to hear this thing about bears!”


[Everyone Laughs]


AUSTIN: And if you want to hear more you can do that by going to friendsatthetable.cash to support us over at Patreon. For 5 bucks a month, you’re able to hear things like this, live. It is a blast to do this stuff. So thank you for your support, thank you for allowing us to do this. As Ali has said, we’ll be back with even more Patreon stuff shortly. I can tell you about this that we are text final on the upcoming postcard package. [ALI: Yessss] We have some incredible art, associated with it. That I’m so excited to talk about but can’t do yet. Um, and I will say that— speaking of Bluff City— these upcoming postcards are tied to some upcoming events that— already-teased events— inside Bluff City. If you were like “what was up with that Masks intro? With that third Masks intro?” You might wanna get those postcards. So— I guess it’s already— people have already subscribed to the postcard level get those, Ali?


ALI: Yeah [Laughs Hard]


AUSTIN: So...hmmm.. So, look forward to it basically.


ART: We’ll do a postcard catch up some day.


AUSTIN: We’ll figure it out. We’re doing patreon catch up right now. Next up is postcard catch up, we do—- I will say that’s a thing we wanna do internally. We just wanna make sure that it's, that it makes sense both for people who pay us postcard-money every month and for people who wanna later pay us for some postcards. So we’ll figure out a solution to that, probably at some point probably in 2019. Anyway look forward to those. Is there anything else we should talk about?


[Pause]


AUSTIN: OIh we might take a break on Chr— we probably will take a break the week of Christmas.


ALI: Oh we’ll definitely take a break on the 27th, for sure.


AUSTIN: Right? Yeah, so 27th  there will not be an episode— but that’s still a couple weeks out though. So until then, enjoy all the content!


ART: Are we gonna have like, a placekeeper episode like “Hey I’m Austin. See you next time!”


AUSTIN: Probably one of those. I mean that's just me being “Hey I’m Austin. See me next time!”


ART: I mean, you can just use that.


AUSTIN: Hey it’s austin. We don’t have an episode this week because it’s Christmas...weekend— week? Maybe I’m in the dentists? I don’t know. I’m not gonna be here. Who could say?


ANDREW: Hey before we go?


AUSTIN: Yeah?


ANDREW: Can I tell you my favorite bear joke?


ALI: Sure.


AUSTIN: Absolutely.


ANDREW: It needs to— it really works better in person but I'll try.


AUSTIN: We can just pretend, where are we at?


ANDREW: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Gimme the scene.


ANDREW: we’re just sitting at a table


AUSTIN: Where though? At a diner? At a library?


ANDREW: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Which of the two?


ALI: Like an Uno’s?


AUSTIN: Uno’s that’s—


ANDREW: Not a library, not a library.


AUSTIN: This is words?


ANDREW: There’s audio involved, yeah—


AUSTIN: So we’re at an Uno’s Pizzeria Kitchen.


ANDREW: Yes, absolutely— 


AUSTIN: I have a ribeye steak, which you shouldn’t order form an Uno’s Pizzeria Kitchen.


ANDREW: Probably not—


AUSTIN: But I’m in the mood.


ANDREW: Yeah.


AUSTIN: We have a basket of mozzarella sticks together, that's good.


ANDREW: Perfect.


AUSTIN: And I’m looking at you and I’m just like, “yeah, game was good tonight huh?”


ANDREW: Yeah it was. Hey lemme tell you my favorite bear joke Austin.


AUSTIN: Okay


ANDREW: Alright, so a bear walks into a bar. [AUSTIN: Alright.] Bartender says “hey bear, what can I getcha?” and the bear says “I’ll have a Jack aaand… coke.” And the bartender says “okay, but what’s with the big pause there in your order?” [Everyone Sighs] And the bear holds up his hands and says “I’m a beeeeaaarr!!”


AUSTIN: Thank you, good night!!


ANDREW: “Paws,” get it?
