[music intro - “Atop the Marchmont Mountains Cold” by Jack de Quidt]
Janine: And we’re back.
Ali: Hi!
Janine: Hi.
Jack: Hello. Hi.
Janine: We all settled? We all good?
Jack: I think so.
Ali: Yeah. Oh, are we—
Janine: [overlapping] I blew out my nice pine-scented candle cause it was too hot. We are back on, yeah.
Ali: Okay, perfect. I wasn’t sure if we were… speaking to the audience, but—
Janine: I had a nice three-wick pine candle burning, and it’s like, right at the bottom, cause I tend to burn it, like, the week before and the week after Christmas. I tend to get a pine candle. But it’s like, right at the bottom, so it’s… very hot, and I, once, didn’t pay attention when it got to that point, and it left a nice little vaguely-yellowish mark on my white desk, so I’m now very careful about that.
Jack: Oh, no.
Ali: Ohh.
Jack: Yeah.
Janine: Need to put it on a dish or something.
Ali: Maybe you can get—can you—oh, well it’s like a burn mark, so it’s not something you can, like… Clorox, or… just clean the sponge out?
Janine: [overlapping] I’ve, like, peroxided it, and it’s sort of faded over time, but.
Ali: Oh.
Janine: I also just like—that’s also where I put my ceramic paint palette, so it’s—it’s fine. [laughs] It mostly is fine.
Ali: Yeah, yeah. It’s weird, I should’ve candled this year. I had my first experience with a fake tree.
Jack: Ooh.
Janine: Oh, mm.
Ali: And, um… No, don’t—no, I’m—
Jack: Ooh, get a tree!
Janine: There’s so much less cleanup, though.
Ali: No, you—but, I mean—
Jack: But like, you can—[sighs] oh. [laughter]
Ali: You’re supposed to go to an empty lot, give a fireman $50, go home with a tree, and it’s your beautiful tree!
Jack: [overlapping] Uh-huh! He hands you a tree!
Ali: And you care for it! [sighs]
Jack: If you water it, it drops its leaves less. Um…
Ali: Yeah!
Jack: And—and that’s what Hoovers were invented for.
Ali: [laughs] Exact—there’s tree skirts, you know, it’s fine.
Jack: There’s tree skirts.
Ali: And you have the pleasant smell.
Jack: I’m sitting next to a Christmas tree right now, and it rules.
Ali: [laughing] It rules!
Janine: Yeah…
Jack: Like, I can touch it. I’m touching a Christmas tree.
Janine: I feel like I really enjoyed real Christmas trees when I was little, and all I had to do was sit in a car for a bit, and then walk around, and then sit in a car for a bit again.
Ali: Mm-hmm. Mm. [laughs]
Janine: I feel like, as an adult, I’m not as interested in like—
Jack: [sighs] This is…
Janine: Like, now I’m the person who has to vacuum and deal with the sap and stuff, if that…
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: I mean, if we got a real tree, so it’s like, meh, I don’t know.
Jack: [overlapping] This is not very Dovie Bluett of you, Janine. [laughter]
Janine: I—I also just have a really weird, complicated relationship with Chri—we—[sighs] we don’t even set up a tree anymore. So, it’s—it’s like a—it’s like a bleak—[laughs]
Jack: Yeah.
Janine: It’s a bleak holiday around here.
Ali: Yeah.
Jack: It’s the bleak midwinter, from the song.
Ali: Uh-huh.
Janine: It’s part of why the pine candle is such a thing for me now, is like, every Christmas, I need the pine candle, cause the pine candle’s like—that’s the thing.
Ali: Right.
Jack: Yeah.
Janine: That’s the thing where, like, I know it’s Christmas. 
Ali: Yeah. I mean, I—you gotta make Christmas for yourself, which I think… the candle’s a perfect way to do that, and, uh, yeah.
Janine: Yeah.
Ali: [pause] So we’re back. [laughs]
Janine: We’re back.
Ali: Hi! Welcome back to Shooting the Moon. While we were… during—doing the break, I was reading the end game rules.
Jack: Mm.
Ali: And I feel like I’m just gonna let everybody know how this works, so we know how it works going into it. It’s pretty simple. Really, the big thing is that we roll dice pools again, but the dice that we get are equal to the number of points that we’ve received overall. So, it’s not like a whoever-gets-the-most-points-wins situation.
Jack: [overlapping] Oh, wow. [laughs]
Janine: Huh.
Ali: It’s… yeah.
Jack: It’s like we’ve been accumulating dice.
Ali: Because we all have our own—right. Because we all have our own individual goals, so… you know. The Beloved could win, the Suitors could win, there could be ties, there could be three-way ties… There could only be a tie between the two Suitors, and not the Belo—so—yeah. Just so we know, going forward, that is what we are gonna be doing in… [pause] maybe an hour and a half. [laughter] Hour or six. [laughs]
Janine: [laughs] Probably won’t be that long. We’ll see.
Ali: Yeah, we’ll see.
Jack: We’ll be here tomorrow.
Scene One - Carroway [00:06:17]
Ali: [laughs] But yeah, Jack, it’s your turn. Set up the scene. Appeal to your Beloved. Use your traits.
Jack: Okay. The blizzard is now fully in effect, as we see… [pause] We see Carroway riding Ransom through the… did we say… did we say the… What was the—what was the name of this mountain pass? Through the—through the Marchmont Mountains.
Janine: [overlapping] Praline—Pragen?
Jack: The Pra—Pragen? Pragen?
Janine: Pra—or, Pra-
Jack: Prager Pass? I don’t know. 
Janine: Pragel? Was it… [laughs] Sorry.
Jack: Pragel? I don’t—[laughs] um… And I think that—I think that Dovie is with her, riding on the back of Ransom, up in the… up in the Marchmont Mountains, looking for the… for the orange wagon. I think that we have, like, a lantern on a stick, in that old-fashioned way where you can like… you can swing the lantern out, and try and like, cast the light. But the blizzard is falling really, really heavily. And I think it’s—it’s kind of all we can do to see just in front of our faces. I think we have, like, big blankets on back of the horse.
Janine: Can I make a suggestion about specifically why Dovie is tagging along for this?
Jack: Of course. Please.
Janine: So, I think that Dovie, specifically, is—cause this is like, this is like a dangerous thing. Like, [laughs] this is a thing that I think a lot of people would be like, “I don’t—I don’t know if—wouldn’t it be faster if the horse just had you on it?”
Jack: Right.
Janine: That kind of thing.
Jack: Ransom cares not for speed. [laughter]
Janine: I think the thing with Dovie, though, is that… you know, we’ve established that this is a world that has, like, small amounts of mundane magic in it. And probably, like, big amounts of less mundane magic, but most of what we have onscreen is sort of a more mundane thing. I think that Dovie knows a kind of magic that is like, not really flashy. It is specifically a magic that she uses when she is… is crafting something, when she’s making something, that is, like, grip-based. Like, it makes her grip a lot more sure.
Jack: Huh.
Janine: So, she doesn’t have to worry about fumbling with her needle, or, you know, dropping fabric and stuff on the floor. Like, it just makes her… it doesn’t really affect her dexterity, but it makes her a lot more effective, and a lot less, you know, clumsy, in the way that everyone would be normally.
Jack: Right.
Janine: And I think probably when Carroway mentioned her plan, Dovie was like, okay, well, that’s super dangerous. [Jack laughs] But if I go with you, then I can make sure that Ransom doesn’t lose his footing.
Jack: Yeah, yeah yeah.
Janine: Like, I can apply this ability, and make sure that whatever happens, you will at least come back safe. Probably. Unless there is some other snow-related, horrible thing. But at least in terms of slipping and falling on a mountain, that probably won’t happen.
Jack: Right. Yeah. And it’s treacherous. This is some real, um… [pause] like, hair—like, hairpin turns. The horse is obviously very stable, made doubly stable by the fact that Dovie is here with us. And I think, like, occasionally, like, through the—through the drifts of snow, we see the lights from the clocktower in the village below, or the town below, the lights from the town as we come around another bend, ice under the horse’s feet. I think it’s mostly silent, other than the sounds of the bridle. I assume that Carroway is focused on riding, and Dovie is focused on… I don’t—is it—is it an active or a passive magic? I’m not sure. Everyone’s very cold, which I think is also not really helping. 
Jack: But at least from Carroway’s perspective, there is definitely this sense of like, being on an adventure with someone you care about, as treacherous as it is.
Ali: I find your [laughs] sexy horse so annoying. This is such a good scene. [laughter] Um.
Jack: Oh, can we also have those sheets back, Janine? On the screen.
Janine: Yeah, I know, I just—I just switched. I just switched. Yeah.
Jack: Okay, cool.
Janine: Also remembered. [laughs]
Ali: Um…
Jack: Ali, if you kill my horse… [laughter]
Ali: No. Never. Oh my god. No. Who do you think that I am? No.
Jack: It’d be a real heel-turn moment.
Ali: My—no! No no no. I just—I’m complimenting you by negging you.
Jack: [laughs] Okay.
Ali: And… yeah. By being annoyed, is how I’m complimenting you. I think that the hurdle is that you arrive at the oranges. You find the [laughs] the… [Jack laughs] You find…
Jack: Does it just loom out of the snow, suddenly? Like an overturned carriage or something.
Ali: Right, yeah. I think it’s one of those things where it’s like, you know, it’s one of those—those mountain paths, where it’s like, you’re kind of in between two, like, different mounds, and it’s, you know, you’re going up this kind of tunnel, and there’s like, trees on one side, and the other side is more of like a cliff, and you turn the corner, and you kind of see the—the ditch that the oranges ended up in. And the hurdle of the scene is that the oranges are there, and the cart is there, though in bad condition—one of the wheels is broken, and also, there is a family of squirrels going to town on those oranges. [laughter] They’re very happy to have found some food of this manner in the middle of the winter. They do not get a get like this… basically ever. Well—I guess, you know, other people drop fruit [laughs] on mountain trails. It’s treacherous. But this is a score.
Jack: Yeah!
Ali: [laughs] So not only are these squirrels very hungry, they are delighted, and they are defensive of these oranges. [Jack laughs]
Jack: [pause] Mm. [Ali laughs] 
Ali: [pause] So. You guys get three responses.
Jack: Shit. [Ali laughs]
Ali: Three responses. You get… I’m scrolling down…
Jack: I mean, I think—I think first of all, Carroway just shouts,
        Jack (as Carroway): No!
Jack: And the squirrels just do nothing. [laughter] Just continue—don’t even look up, just continue to enjoy the oranges.
Janine: [overlapping] One of them flicks its tail, and like, that’s it.
Jack: Yeah. Yeah, that’s absolutely it. Cause these are warm oranges as well. These are oranges that still have the vestiges of travel magic on them, so it’s like… It’s not even like these are frozen… frozen oranges.
Janine: These are summer oranges in winter.
Jack: These are summer oranges in winter!
Ali: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack: Goddamn.
Ali: They’re like, so juicy, they’re—they’re prime oranges.
Jack: A squirrel’s delight!
Ali: And also, they’ve been, like—they’ve been like—they’ve been preserved in the snow. They have not been damaged by this.
Jack: No.
Ali: In fact, it is like, even more so of a get. Because it’s like nice, chilled orange juice, as you’re like eating these—like, these squirrels are ecstatic.
Jack: That fucking sucks! [Ali laughs]
Ali: So, you get three responses. You get… two dice when you use one of your traits, and one dice if you use a second one. Or, you can get a fifth dice if one of you makes a suggestion for the other that the other suggests—uh, accepts.
Jack: Okay. Okay. Um, hm. Hmm. 
Janine: [pause] I’m gonna suggest—like, I would like to suggest something. [laughs]
Jack: Go for it.
Ali: Sure.
Janine: Can we walk Ransom around the squirrels and force the squirrels to make eye contact with Ransom?
Ali: Of course.
Jack: Oh, ho ho. [laughs]
Ali: The horse is so powerful that—yeah, of course.
Jack: Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Janine: Cause right now they’re—all those squirrels, they have their back to us, but if we get in a position where they can’t, you know, look away.
Jack: Yeah, absolutely.
Ali: Mm-hmm.
Jack: Yeah. Yeah, it’s a kind of Medusa situation, except if Medusa was a massive horse. [laughter] 
[00:15:00]
Ali: Genius.
Jack: Okay, so I’m gonna take two dice for that. I’m also going to… [pause] Hm. [pause] I’m going to—I’m gonna take two dice for ‘determined.’ Which is that after shouting at the squirrels, and before the Ransom ploy, [Ali laughs] Carroway just like drops down from the horse and like strides confidently towards the squirrels. Um, and just tries to like, first, shoo them away, and then grab at an orange, and then… I guess like receive a scratch, or whatever, and then maybe try to just like kick some [Ali gasps] snow at the squirrels.
Ali: Oh, okay. [laughs]
Jack: Not kick the squirrel! [laughter]
Ali: Scared—I was scared, I’m very—
Jack: Ali! No!
Ali: I—you know—
Janine: My mom kicked a squirrel once, by accident, and she was very upset about it.
Jack: I bet!
Janine: It was like she was—she was reading outside. We were camping, and she was sitting, and the little bit—like, a little tiny squirrel [Ali gasps] started scampering up her leg, and she kind of freaked out and flicked her leg, and it just like kind of flew off into the forest. [Ali laughs]
Jack: That’s awful! I’m not doing that, but I’m—
Janine: She felt very bad about it. [laughs]
Jack: I am, like, kicking snow at them. I’m… just, like, basically, like… Beat one is despair at the squirrels that have stolen my oranges. Beat two is unsuccessful [Ali laughs], time to take this to the squirrels that have stolen my oranges! Beat three is defer to my powerful horse.
Ali: Yeah.
Jack: I’m gonna take two dice. Two dice for that.
Ali: Um, two—
Jack: Oh, sorry—
Ali: You get two more—yeah. You get two more dice if Janine uses one of her traits, one of Dovie’s traits. Or you can get one more if you use one of yours again, Jack. Carroway.
Jack: Oh, I see. That includes the two that I’ve just—just got.
Ali: Yeah. Um, yeah, you get—yeah.
Jack: I—I get two from Janine’s suggestion—
Ali: Yes.
Jack: No, Janine gets—wait.
Ali: Well, you share them.
Janine: Yeah.
Ali: It’s a shared pool.
Jack: Oh, okay.
Ali: Right.
Jack: Okay.
Janine: I have a suggestion for how I might use ‘ingenious.’
Ali: [pause] Sure. It’s your trait, so. [laughs]
Janine: Yeah. No, I—I’m—I’m just saying that in case, like, Jack has something else that they want to suggest, instead of…
Jack: No, I would just try and suggest something for you, and I’m not sure… what. So, you—you go.
Janine: So, Dovie is still on Ransom, right?
Jack: Yeah. I mean, you can be wherever you want.
Janine: [pause] That’s true. [Ali laughs] I think that what Dovie does on top of Ransom is Dovie scoots up a bit in the saddle, takes the reins, and maybe, like, unclips them so that she just has, like, a sort of leather strap. And I think she holds one end of the leather strap, and… uses the other, like, swings it up at some, like, overhanging branches, that are kind of like… I imagine kind of like a rocky, slopey thing, kind of nearby, with, like, some of those really hardy little trees that cling off the side. But there’s like, a lot—it’s been—it’s a blizzard, so there’s like a lot of snow on them. And it’s like, just over these squirrels, and I think she like… swings the end of the strap so that it knocks the snow down onto the squirrels. To like, freak them out a little bit.
Jack: God. Yeah. Hell yeah! War—squirrel war.
Janine: Yeah. [laughs] Sur—I mean—gently—it’s—it’s a gentle thin—like, you know, it’s not gonna hurt. It’s not like a ton of snow. It’s not gonna bury them.
Jack: [overlapping] This is our campaign! [pause] Right. No. Yeah, no. What I’m saying is we are—we are going for these squirrels. [pause] So how many dice does that give us, Ali?
Ali: Two.
Jack: Two?
Ali: Yeah.
Jack: So we now have six dice, total?
Ali: Mm-hmm.
Jack: Okay.
Ali: Two for the suggestion, two for using your own trait the first time, and then for Janine using her own trait.
Jack: Okay. Phew.
Ali: And then I get five for being the hurdler.
Jack: Being some bastard squirrels.
Ali: [laughs] Alright. I am gonna roll my dice.
Jack: Uh-huh. [pause] Ooh!
Ali: So that—ooh. You’re a winner. You’re a super winner. I don’t even have a 5.
Janine: Oh, wow.
Jack: Sweet.
Ali: Well. So… you get…
Janine: Ali, for some reason your die aren’t turning up in the sidebar when you roll them.
Ali: Oh, um…
Janine: I don’t know why. It doesn’t—
Ali: I think—
Janine: [overlapping] It doesn’t really matter, it’s just weird. 
Ali: Yeah. I guess because… yeah, I don’t know.
Jack: [laughs] The mystery tool.
Ali: Sometimes they do, and sometimes they don’t.
Janine: Yeah. They haven’t for the past two rolls, is all. It’s just weird.
Ali: Huh.
Janine: Doesn’t matter.
Ali: If the active Suitor and the Beloved win, they each receive one point towards their own goal, and check off one… yeah. Check off one box. They also may add a new trait to their character.
Jack: Hmm.
Janine: Isn’t it—it’s three points right now, right? Cause we’re on…
Ali: Yes, yes yes yes. Yeah.
Janine: Yeah, okay.
Ali: Round three.
Jack: Hmm. Okay. Can this new trait be related to the narration for having won the scene?
Ali: Absolutely, yeah.
Jack: So, I think that what happens is we hear, through the snow, in the distance, like, a—a… perhaps, first, mistaken for the sound of the wind, but then coming through the sound of the wind, we can hear singing. And it is kind of like… it is—it is wrapping around us, and above us, and it’s this, like, unearthly sound of voices. And I think that these are the witches. [Ali gasps] I don’t think that they’re interacting with us directly. I don’t know if the witches are interested in, like, two weirdos, their horse, retrieving some oranges. [laughs] But like, in the heart of this blizzard, on top of the Marchmont Mountains, the witches who live up here are just kind of doing… they’re doing their own thing, I guess. And at the sound of the… the witch song, the squirrels, like, fucking… [laughs] They’re done. Even—
Ali: Yeah, they gotta go. [laughs]
Jack: Yeah. Even—possibly—I don’t know whether or not they’re frightened of the witches, or they’re being called by the witches… It—it’s not my place to say. [Ali laughs] Ransom, like, his—his eyes fla—his nostrils flare. His—you see the whites of his eyes. He like, stamps his feet, but like, sort of—he’s a good horse, so he—he stays steadfast. And Carroway is sort of just like wow, okay, gather up as much as you can, put it in the things, it’s time to go. But I think in a sort of… it’s a holiday miracle sense, I think that both retrieving the oranges and having heard the song of the witches in the middle of this blizzard is a sort of magical experience for Carroway. So I’m going to put—nope—I’m just gonna put a little square there, apparently.
Ali: Mm-hmm.
Jack: I’m gon—[laughs] I’m gonna put ‘heard witches sing in the mountains,’ as my trait.
Ali: Oh. [pause] Okay.
Janine: Um…
Jack: [pause] And now we have as many oranges as we need. [laughter] Ransom is a big horse. We got fucking tons of them.
Janine: I get to add a trait too, right?
Ali: Yes.
Janine: Um… I think I just want to add something kind of simple. [pause] I think just like, ‘adventurous,’ or some—like, something of just like, this was a big, going out of her comfort zone to help someone kind of thing. Like, I kind of picture Dovie as a bit of a homebody. Like, she kind of just likes staying even within a certain district in town, like, that’s… what she’s used to, so going up in the mountains to—during a blizzard, to help someone retrieve, like, oranges and stuff is like a big thing, and then it ended up being a big thing. So I think something just like a—just like… [pause] Maybe, like, ‘went out on a limb,’ or something.
Ali: Yeah. I think that works.
Jack: Yeah. It’s kind of a date.
Janine: Yeah.
Ali: [quietly] It’s not quite a date. [laughs] If you—okay. If you know someone who owns a horse, and they take you on their horse, um…
Janine: That’s a date.
Ali: Alone, on a mountain?
Jack: No, that’s a date.
Ali: Yeah, that’s a date.
Jack: Yeah! To get oranges?!
Ali: So yeah. Yeah. That’s a date. [pause] I mean, horse owners out there, be… be careful about the signals that you’re sending. [laughter]
Jack: Yeah. [laughs] This is not complex.
Ali: [laughs] Once the horse is involved, you’re, you know. 
Scene Two - Mellow [00:24:30]
Ali: Okay, perfect. So you won. And then it’s my turn to set up a scene with… Mellow and the Beloved. Uh-huh. [clicks tongue] Where’s Mellow at this moment… [pause] I think that there’s… It’s so funny, cause when we—when I was like thinking about this game for like a year, I was always thinking of like, oh, we’re gonna go all find out about this curse, and then I listened to it and realized that that was all put on Carroway’s plate. [laughter] 
But I think that there’s still—there was that, um… There was that desire in Mellow to be like, you know, I’m someone who has a curse. I believe curses are very liveable. I don’t think that we—we should… you know. Be making all of this, the—the—[laughs] toys, and stuff, out of velvet that we’re not… unsure of. But, you know. I think that she—she sort of wants to get the… the, like, neighborhood curse understanding onto, like, a higher level. [laughter]
Jack: You know, fair!
Ali: [laughs] You know! So I think that, you know… her…
Janine: That’s a huge breakthrough. If you figure out—if you figure out the curse on that velvet that’s just gonna get thrown out, or whatever, and you figure out the curse is just, like, you don’t want to eat bread on Sundays, then…
Ali: Right. Yeah. And you’re like, you know, that’s fine.
Janine: [overlapping] That’s—that’s like, a bunch of free velvet, basically. [laughs]
Jack: Yeah!
Ali: Right! Yeah!
Jack: Holy shit.
Ali: What if the curse was like, ‘loved carrots?’ People would be buying seven of them for each of their kids.
Janine: Yeah.
Ali: Like, it would be fantastic. So I think that she has… She’s kind of—kind of a—I’m going to involve Carroway in a scene too, even though it’s supposed to be like a—a thing, just between the Beloved. I think she has enlisted Carroway, and Mellow, and Dovie, and her friend Stacy, and that they are putting together… essentially like zines, but they’re like little pamphlets about, like… here’s ways that you can figure out what kind of curse that you’re dealing with. If it’s—if it’s a fabric-based curse, and you put it in a window for three hours in the moonlight, and it’s orange, then you know that it’s a transformation spell. Or like, things like that. [laughs] Yeah. Yes. I think that’s what’s happening. That she’s trying to sort of make this community effort to like, have a, you know. Inform the masses about curses. And I think that it’s, like… it’s not at the Glacier Express, but I think that she is like sort of… [laughs] She’s sort of almost had the event like sort of catered by them, right? She kind of got, like, a cookie plate to sort of invite everybody to her—her home, probably. To be like, 
Ali (as Mellow): Hi, welcome! Come sit down, and we can talk about these curses. And Carroway, thank you so much for getting those oranges, oh my god. I didn’t realize that that would be such a… you know, such a stressor on you.
Ali: She’s lying. [laughter] But.
Jack (as Carroway): You’re fine. You’re fine. I went up into the mountains.
Ali (as Mellow): Oh, my god!
Jack (as Carroway): I heard some witches.
Ali (as Mellow): You heard some witches?
Jack (as Carroway): Dovie came too. [Mellow gasps] Yeah, it was beautiful. It was terrifying, but it was beautiful.
Ali (as Mellow): Ohh.
Jack (as Carroway): I kept thinking, is this the witch that did the curse? But I didn’t want to, you know, stick around to find out.
Ali (as Mellow): Oh. I mean, did you talk to them at all? Or were they j—you know, kind of, um, busy.
Jack (as Carroway): [pause] I think they were busy. 
Ali (as Mellow): Yeah.
Jack (as Carroway): I—I couldn’t tell how close they were.
Ali (as Mellow): Oh! So you—you heard them, you didn’t see them?
Jack (as Carroway): W—no. I didn’t—no, I didn’t see them.
Ali (as Mellow): Ohh. That’s...
Jack: This is a point to Mellow. [laughter]
Ali: [laughing] I don’t think that she means that like—
Ali (as Mellow): [patronizingly] You know, a witch sighting is, you know, a big deal!
Jack (as Carroway): Mm-hmm.
Ali (as Mellow): And a—no. Not—not a witch—you had a witch sighting. You had a witch sighting, even though there wasn’t sight. And that’s it—I just—that’s amazing!
Jack (as Carroway): That’s okay. That’s okay. [laughs]
Ali (as Mellow): Um, what was the song like? I—you know—hearing them is even more incredible, in my opinion, honestly.
Jack (as Carroway): Oh.
Ali (as Mellow): There was a song? Was it like—uh, you know, jovial? Or…
Jack (as Carroway): It was like… it was like—it was like, ethereal? It was like, uh…
Ali (as Mellow): Oh?
Jack (as Carroway): It sounded like the wind. [Mellow gasps softly] It was beautiful. Ransom didn’t think that it did.
Jack: Cut to Ransom, [laughter] staring outside the window at some poor individual. 
Ali: [laughing] Stacy and Ransom are just having a staring contest.
Ali (as Mellow): Well, pr—well, thank you, again. Um, you know, I… I feel like the—the entire town has sort of really come around. I’ve tried to come together on this velvet thing, but no one has done more than you.
Jack (as Carroway): Oh. Thank you.
Ali (as Mellow): You know. To go to a mountain with your horse to collect horses is just really… um, it’s incredible. 
[00:30:00]
Jack (as Carroway): Thank you. [laughter]
Ali (as Mellow): [laughs] [pause] Um… yeah. [pause] So, um, I—I’ve—I, you know, I told you all about the curse that I’ve had. So, I collected some of the materials that my parents were given… when I—when the curse was found out. And then also just some other, you know, what to do if you have a curse, things like that. And I’ve—I’ve sort of already made the list out, and we just kind of have to collect… you know—you know, just find all of these, and I think it would be nice to give out to people, cause you know. [sighs] There’s been a lot of talk on the town about these—these curses, and I just want to make that people, you know, are really informed about this, because I feel like there’s been a lot of… undue stress on the community, that there might not need to be. Given the nature of a majority of curses.
Jack (as Carroway): [long pause] Hm.
Ali: [laughter]
Jack (as Carroway): [long pause] Hm. Heh.
Ali: [laughter]
Janine: Dovie’s there too, right? Dovie’s also folding…
Ali: Yes.
Janine: Okay.
Ali: Yeah yeah yeah. Everyone’s here.
Janine: [pause] What was… Hex’t… Lewis? What was his last name?
Jack: Oh, Linus.
Janine: Linus. [laughs] I think Dovie, like, smiles, as she’s like folding pamphlets or whatever. Is like,
Janine (as Dovie): I heard that Hex’t Lewis is at the—the warehouse—
Jack (as Carroway): [overlapping] Linus. [laughs]
Janine (as Dovie): Sorry, Linus!
Janine: [laughter] Shit! [Jack laughs]
Janine (as Dovie): Hex’t Lewis and his twin brother Hex’t Linus both came in from the mountains, and they are… they’re in the—the warehouse. I heard that they are… you know, it’s slow progress, but they’re freeing up some of the supplies, and… eating their oranges.
Ali (as Mellow): Oh, perfect. Yeah, um… [pause] Yeah, yeah, you know, I wonder… I really wonder what curses we’re—we ended up getting with them. I’m not, you know. I don’t want anyone to be cursed. But. [pause] You know, it’s fun to—it’s like a grab bag. You know. I don’t know. [Janine laughs] I would—there’s—there’s so many curses in the world. You know, sometimes you just… your fingernails are blue. And sometimes, you know, you hiccup on Thursdays. Sometimes carrots taste like, uh, bananas, and that’s weird, but you know, you live your life.
Jack (as Carroway): [pause] Hm.
Ali: [laughter]
Jack: [pause] I’m looking at your list of traits. [laughter]
Ali: Yeah, I was like—I’m—I keep talking, being like, [vaguely] mm. [laughs]
Jack: Yeah, no, I’m trying to—I’m trying to—
Ali: [overlapping] [vaguely] Yeah, you know. [laughs]
Jack: Hmm. [pause] I’m trying to work out, like, like, you’re furious… What are you specifically—are you just broadly furious at…
Ali: I think that… yeah. I’ve characterized Mellow as this sort of, like, hot-headed, but also, like, really… She’s, like, very indignant about being sort of anti-... the department store,
Jack: Mm.
Ali: and, I guess, establishment, in that way. But not in a way that’s like… I don’t know. Very active, I guess? I don’t know. She did burn all those bridges. [laughs] Told that guy to fuck off! [Janine laughs] But, yeah. I don’t know. I think—I think that she’s—she’s… I’ve—I’ve been playing furious as both quick-tempered, and also, like, having these deeply rooted, like, fuck… that… store. [laughs]
Jack: Okay. Yeah. Alright. Mm-hmm. Okay. So, I think—what—are we in Penny Many—Many—Penny Many-Things?
Ali: Um… oh, that probably makes more sense. I was like, they’re at Mellow’s house. But [laughs] I think it would probably make—the story makes more sense. [pause] Either way you want to go on that is fine. 
Jack: I think—then I think—I think there is like, a face. Like a—like a Undertaker pale face at the window, and the bell of the—of Penny Many-Things opens, and stooping under the door comes Mr. Click from MaGuddans. And if anything, he’s dressed more expensively than last time. [Ali laughs] I don’t think Mr. Click is dressed well, I think he’s just wearing, like… like smart, you know, shop manager gear, but like… that’s probably kind of slightly ill-fitting, but like, clearly the quality of the materials has gone up… than it was the last time—the last time we saw him. And he comes in, and he says, 
Jack (as Mr. Click): [posh RP accent] Miss Bluett. Hello.
Janine (as Dovie): Good—good to see you. How are you… how are you doing? What can I help you with?
Jack (as Mr. Click): Well, same as ever, same as ever. Mellow! Mellow Aster. That’s—[sighs] I’ve heard word has been going around the town that you think you’re… better than us.
Ali (as Mellow): I do think that.
Jack (as Mr. Click): [sputters] Well. [Janine laughs] Well I don’t know if the bottom line quite corresponds to that notion, Miss Aster.
Ali (as Mellow): And that’s how you measure things?
Jack (as Mr. Click): Ah, well, yes.
Ali (as Mellow): Well, that’s not how I measure things. And I don’t care about your measurements. Which I—
Jack (as Mr. Click): [overlapping] No, I’m sure you don’t. But your customers might.
Ali (as Mellow): [sighs sharply] I… have a healthy amount of customers. I’ve been doing very good this holiday season. My, um… my dogs are wagging, is all I’ll say.
Jack (as Mr. Click): Do you? You see, I have a distinct feeling that you… said go “f” yourself [laughter] to someone who is simply trying to help! What message do you think that sends to your customers, Miss Aster? You cannot simply go around telling people to go “f” themselves, or the chickens will come home to roost.
Ali (as Mellow): I don’t need to defend myself to you. And… I did say that.
Jack (as Mr. Click): I’m sure you did. I heard it on very good authority.
Ali (as Mellow): I bet—bet you did. You should trust whoever said that, cause they’re right that I said that to them.
Jack (as Mr. Click): Well… [sighs] I’ve simply come to deliver, first, the message of—of shock and disappointment at your, ah, [pause, Ali laughs] your conduct, and secondly, to let you both know that MaGuddens will be beginning a very new, very, ah… aggressive advertising campaign to, ah, draw focus away from smaller, more cursed establishments, and towards the, ah, comfort, the bright lights—
Ali (as Mellow): [interrupting] MaGuddens is cursed enough. MaGuddens has their own curses. And it’s not even the kind of curses that we’ll deal with, the curses of the people. You’re cursed in your heart. You’re cursed in your business practices. You’re cursed in the way that you… are dressed right now.
Jack (as Mr. Click): Do you think that I care, even—
Ali (as Mellow): [overlapping] And I would like it if you left.
Jack (as Mr. Click): [pause] Well, me leaving isn’t going to change anything, you know.
Ali (as Mellow): Well, you know, this is a fine town, with fine people in it, and everybody likes toys. And I think we’re going to be fine. Cause you know what? People can recognize when people like you try to squish other people down. And we’re not gonna be squished, okay?
Jack (as Mr. Click): [pause] Okay. I mean, f—fine. [accent slips] Let’s—let’s roll some dice. [laughter]
Ali: [laughing] O—okay. Um.
Janine: I really appreciate that Mr. Click is just a Burn Gorman character. [Ali laughs]
Jack: He’s fucking—it’s the fucking worst.
Janine: It’s perfect. [laughter] Like, perfect casting.
Jack: He’s just—he’s just—he’s just the most… He’s like, what if they cast the wrong guy in You’ve Got Mail? [Janine laughs]
Ali: Yeah.
Jack: They meant to cast Tom Hanks, [laughs] and instead they cast Burn Gorman. It was like, ah, role’s fucked now. Okay. [Ali laughs] So I have five dice.
Ali: Yes. I am going to… I think that I have used my ‘determined’ trait in this manner, by having Mellow be someone who is like… [laughter]
Jack: “You’re cursed in your heart.”
Ali: [laughs] Yes! Um, by being, like, very sure of her ideals, [Jack laughs] and also very sure of, like… Because ‘determined’ was like a thing of being like, you know what, I can be—I can make my own version of success. And her being like, “the town’s gonna see through your advertising that says that we suck,”
Jack: Right.
Ali: is her being determined about that. So yeah. [laughs] 
Janine: I’d like to use a trait?
Ali: Yeah?
Janine: I think? Or an attribute, technically? I think I want to… I think I want to use ‘best stuffed dog face design.’
Ali: [gasps]
Jack: Yes! Hell yeah! [laughs]
Janine: Because I think that… I’m picturing Dovie sitting on, like, a little… one of those little stools on casters that you can kind of like scoot around a workspace, or behind counters, and stuff, with. And I think that’s probably her… there’s probably a lot of those kicking around her shop, especially in the back, but also in the front. And I think she just kind of… as this conversation is happening, I think she is like, extra aware, like, he came into my shop.
Jack: Right.
Janine: Like, he’s—this is—this is not an argu—this is not, like, a sternly worded letter he is sending in private. This is—he is rolling me into this, and I am not a little shop owner. Like, I’m not a little—I’m not a little—I’m not in the market, like, I own Penny Many-Things.
Ali: Right.
Janine: I make the best stuffed dog faces in town. So I think she kind of… you know, she’s aware that there is a display of really amazing stuffed dogs, directly, like… [Jack laughs] It’s probably like, behind and to the left a little bit. I think she like, straightens up, and just kind of like, pivots just enough that if he looks at her—if and when he looks at her, at any point in this conversation—she is framed just by a wall [laughter] of really fucking adorable stuffed dogs. They’re all so good. They all look so happy. Some of them are winking. And like a thing—a thing you don’t notice, when you look at one of these dogs on its own, is that they are all a little bit different. They all have some little bit of character, like, they are not—it is not a wall of identical dogs. Every single dog has a slight… variation in its personality. A slight variation in what makes it special and distinct. And MaGuddens has nothing like that. Everything in MaGuddens is the same. [laughs]
Ali: So take that.
Janine: So take that.
Ali: I’m also going to suggest… ‘feeling connected,’ as a trait we can use for this.
Jack: Mm.
Janine: Oh.
Ali: Because I feel like there is [laughs] in the… in the activity of having a weird jerk walk into your store, and then having someone you sort of barely know, and [laughs] are, like, considering a professional relationship with, like, screaming at this person could go either way. But I think that like, in Mellow trying to speak of the—you know, the community, and the strength of—of… them being independent… toymakers, that Dovie feeling, you know, an attachment to both of the—the Suitors would strengthen the argument in terms of either, like, Dovie backing her up and being like, yeah, you—you do have to leave, and fuck off, or just, you know, in some other way.
Jack: [pause] Okay. So that’s one extra die?
Ali: That’s two extra dice if Janine accepts that suggestion.
Jack: Oh, right.
Ali: Which… yeah.
Janine: Yeah.
Ali: Unless—okay, cool. Perfect. Let’s roll.
Jack: [groans]
Ali: Am I gonna lose you?
Jack: [gasps]
Ali: [gasps]
Jack: Aw, hell yeah! [Janine laughs]
Ali: Three sixes! Yes baby! That’s what you want, a clean win, after telling off a weird… jerk… guy. And that’s three points for me. There we go. Hell yeah! And then we each get a trait. [pause] Hm. [pauses, laughs] Um. I—I want my trait to be like, kind of a positive spin on this, like, deep… indignation. This, like… passionate soul that Mellow keeps displaying.
Jack: Yeah, it’s like—it’s like Mr. Click, like, decided to bring the fight to your door, and you just withstood it completely. [laughs]
Ali: [laughs] Yeah!
Jack: It’s like, there’s some kind of, like, apotheosis of your… your… hot-temperedness, being like, oh, actually, this is working out great for me.
Ali: Right. Yeah. There’s—there’s—there’s value in being hot-blooded, 
Jack: Yes.
Ali: when you’re able to kind of defend yourself and your—your community, in that way. [pause] I do want to just write ‘hot-blooded.’ I’m just gonna write that, because I—
[00:45:00]
Janine: ‘Righteous?’ It’s something—
Jack: [overlapping] Yeah.
Janine: ‘Hot-blooded’ is good.
Ali: Yeah. [laughs]
Jack: We know what this is talking about. [Janine laughs]
Ali: Right. Yeah. It—it’s a great trait to have when someone eventually writes an anime theme about Mellow, so. [laughter] Very happy for her to have it. [pause] And you get one too.
Janine: Um… I think I want to go with something like… [pause] Mm… I want something like ‘fired up.’ You know? [laughs]
Jack: Mm.
Janine: I want something that like, mirrors Mellow’s… condition.
Ali: Mm.
Janine: Like ‘fired up,’ or ‘inspired,’ or like… Especially going into this—this last turn, or this last leg thing.
Ali: [laughs] Yeah. I… I feel like ‘inspired’ works. I wonder if there’s, like, a… is there like a more emotional version of ‘inspired?’ Cause ‘inspired’ feels like creatively inspired to me, in a way that like… 
Jack: Is it like—
Janine: [overlapping] Can I be ‘fired up?’
Jack: Yeah.
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: What were you gonna say, Jack?
Jack: Like ‘uplifted’ or something, I don’t know.
Ali: Right.
Janine: Mm.
Ali: Or like, ‘encouraged,’ or something.
Janine: ‘Bolstered?’ Or like there’s a…
Ali: Oh, ‘bolstered’ works.
Janine: word that’s like ‘bolstered,’ that’s… [pause] um… I kind of like ‘bolstered,’ though.
Ali: Okay.
Janine: We don’t really need to dwell on it.
Ali: Yeah, because Janine, now it is your turn once more, to—
Jack: Oh, I mean, do you want to narrate—like, is there a particular satisfying way you—
Ali: [overlapping] Oh, yes yes yes.
Jack: ...you dispatch Clerk?
Ali: Yeah. [laughs] [pause] I do think it’s exactly that, though. It’s like, Mellow being like,
        Ali (as Mellow): You should leave the store.
Ali: Have no, sort of, grounds to say that to somebody. Not in her own store. [Jack laughs] But Dovie sort of being like,
        Ali (as Dovie): Yeah. You should go.
Ali: And like, just having them sort of be shoulder-to-shoulder that way owns, and is a win. [laughter]
Jack: [overlapping] Like a deeply satisfying kind of, like…
Ali: Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. It’s really satisfying both to be in synch in that way, and also to… make a grown man… snicker and walk out of your store. [laughter] I think that’s exactly what happens. He—you know—he’s like,
Ali (as Mr. Click): [mumbling indistinctly] You know, you’re gonna see the day. [mumbling]
Ali: But. [Janine laughs] You know. He knows that he’s done.
Jack: It’s like he’s taken a wound. He’s like, visibly taken a wound. 
Ali: Right.
Jack: Yeah.
Ali: Yeah. And he kind of shuffles out, and he… he, like, looks at them through the window, but then his gaze is immediately taken away by Ransom, who is [laughter] staring him down as he… 
Jack: [laughing] Staring daggers!
Ali: Yeah yeah yeah. He like… he goes to look over his shoulder to look out of the window, but as his head is turning, he sees Ransom, and sort of just like… that kind of like, you can see his body shake in shock. [Janine laughs]
Jack: Mm-hmm.
Ali: And then, just like, embarrassingly, and just still frustrated, sort of put his hands in his pockets and march down the street. [pause] And yeah. And scene.
Janine: Oh, I take three—do I take three points for that as well?
Ali: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Janine: Well, good news, cause one way or the other, Dovie’s not gonna have a bad time here, probably. Right? Cause we’re at three—
Ali: [overlapping] Yeah. Um, it’s all dice, so you could roll seven 1s. You know?
Janine: Yeah that’s true. [Jack laughs]
Ali: But.
Janine: That—that is true. [laughs]
Jack: Eugh.
Ali: We’ll see—[laughing] we’ll see how it goes.
Jack: Wowee.
Janine: Okay.
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: So. 
Ali: [pause] Yeah.
Scene Three - Dovie [00:49:10]
Janine: For our last, like, big conflict thing…
Ali: Mm-hmm?
Janine: I think I know how to, like, tie this all together. I think that Dovie approaches Mellow and Carroway, and says, like,
Janine (as Dovie): I want to give you the left window and you the right window if you can develop a toy to fill it for Christmas.
Ali (as Mellow): [gasps] Oh…
Janine (as Dovie): You have to—you like, obviously, you have to be able to produce more than one. Like, you have to be able to fill that window.
Ali (as Mellow): Right.
Janine (as Dovie): And you have to make a toy that, like, works, and stuff. But like, if you can produce that toy… and fill that window, that window is yours.
Jack (as Carroway): It’s a toy-off!
Ali (as Mellow): It’s a toy-off. It’s a toy-off. 
Ali: Yeah. I—
Janine: I don’t think this breaks how this game works? I think this is… right? Like…
Ali: Yeah, so, the way that the end game is gonna work is that we all roll and it determines kind of who wins, and you either win the prize or the… or your dream. So even if—if me and Jack tie, then we each get a window. If only one of us wins, then we get a window, so… I think that like… me and Jack, in overcoming this hurdle, wouldn’t be able to be like… I do it. You know? [laughter] So we should—we should be describing ways that, like, Mellow and Carroway are, like, dealing with the situation, but not the—the end game.
Janine: Mm-kay. I also want to—as part of this, I want to be clear that, like… that Dovie is also, like, offering her help.
Ali: Right.
Janine: Like, she is offering to—to collaborate on these projects. Like, if you want a good dog face, she will do that for you. If she want—if you want legs, like, you know, that’s… part of—part of this is, she is available as a collaborator.
Ali: Yeah. I—
Janine: [overlapping] In limited capacity, cause she’s doing two at once, but you know.
Ali: Right. Yeah yeah. The only—I guess the only, like, thing that I would want to keep in mind for me and Jack is that like, there’s gonna be a winner of this round. But again, it’s not like, I win the window.
Janine: Yeah.
Ali: But it’s like, I won… the toys exactly as I wanted, or however else. You know.
Janine: This is mostly me opening it up to if you want to have them flirting and stuff. [Ali laughs] Like, that’s—it’s not like she’s just like, “Go to your workshop. I don’t want to see you for a week.” You know?
Ali: [laughs] Right, yeah yeah yeah.
Jack: Right.
Ali: That would be very funny, though. And then, again, yeah. Two dice for our own traits, three dice if we involve—um… involve a trait, but then make it complicated in some way. Three dice if we create a complication for our opposite Suitor. Three dice for flirting. Four dice for taking a suggestion from another Suitor, and five for crossing off an attribute, but like, very deeply changing something about the character’s circumstance around that.
Janine: Oh, also, I think I wasn’t —I have to click—I have to pick a level for this too, right? Still?
Ali: Yes, yes yes. Um… it—yeah.
Janine: I’m saying this is a level 3, because if neither of you come through, Dovie has not had time to make a big—a big holiday toy.
Jack: Right.
Ali: Mm-hmm.
Jack: Empty—empty windows, and stuff.
Janine: Like, she’s kind of putting her—putting her hopes on you, here. [laughs]
Ali: Mm-hmm. [pause] Yeah. So, Janine, you get nine dice. Off of—
Janine: [overlapping] I just drew a big line. [laughs] I drew a huge blue line! [Ali laughs] Yep. Mm-kay. That’s fine. I can’t delete it?
Ali: Um… oh.
Jack: Can’t use that dice now. [laughter]
Ali: Well—oop—
Jack: You crossed out.
Ali: I can’t—I al—I can’t delete it. Oh.
Janine: There we go.
Ali: Oh, there you are. Yeah, you take your dice. So you have nine, for doing that. And then yeah, Jack, we each get three responses, and three responses only, so. Make it or break it.
Jack: Oh, god. Okay. [Ali sighs]
Janine: [pause] [laughs] Pitch your toys! Like.
Jack: Mm-hmm. [pause] Hm. 
Ali: [long pause] Oh, and just so you keep in mind, if you’re making a suggestion for another player… or asking for one, you… it is something that goes wrong, and that you gain a complicating trait.
Jack: Okay.
Ali: Not that it makes a huge difference right not, because we’re… almost done, but.
Jack: Okay. Um… [pause] Alright. I’m going to suggest a complication.
Ali: Okay.
Jack: For Ali, that is up for approval by Janine. Which, if I’m right, would give me three dice if Janine approves it. Right?
Ali: Right. Yeah. You would get four dice if it would have to be something that I would have to approve. But I don’t get a trait, so that’s the difference there. 
Jack: I see. Yes. Okay. So, the complication is… out comes, you know, three MaGuddens attendants, and put up a billboard [laughs] visible from your workstation, which is basically just like, “MaGuddens! Our toys aren’t cursed!” That’s not—that’s not a great billboard. Um. [laughter] I feel like that’s a real… my billboard saying “Our toys aren’t cursed” [laughter] is answering a lot of questions you… um… “MaGuddens!”
Janine: [overlapping] We could introduce a kind of curse-free guarantee, that’s like…
Jack: Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah!
Janine: Curse warranty, or something? [Ali gasps]
Jack: Oh, oh, oh, oh! I’ve got it! “MaGuddens! Turn in your possibly cursed toys—” [Ali and Janine gasp] “—from other retailers—” this sign is long. [laughter] “MaGuddens! Turn in your possibly cursed toys from other retailers for guaranteed NO curse toys.”
Ali: [softly] Wow…
Jack: “From the MaGuddens Toy Department, Spencer Crisp.” Says the sign. And it’s not like this sign is set up such that anybody looking in your window would also see the sign. It’s almost more like it’s been set up so that you are always seeing the sign, when you look out from your workstation.
Ali: Right.
Jack: It’s MaGuddens just trying to psych you out.
Ali: Yeah. That’s tough.
Jack: And I get three dice from that, if Janine approves it.
Janine: Yes. I had a—[laughter]
Ali: I really love that, cause I love the idea of like… a lot of the small businesses, like, having little cards on their desk, that say, like, “Have a curse? Here’s some curse facts!”
Jack: [laughs] Yeah. [Janine laughs]
Ali: “Curses and you! Information about curses, for more level-headed…” whatever. And then, in the wake of this is a sign that’s like, if you buy a cursed thing, I’ll just give you a thing.
Jack: Yeah.
Ali: It’s a bad look. I love it.
Jack: It’s no skin—we have warehouses full of uncursed toys.
Ali: That’s perfect. Cool. [laughs] [pause] Um… I think that I am going to… I’m gonna use my ‘determined’ trait by, you know, just, you know, working very hard on this new toy. But I am gonna take three dice, cause I am going to add the… a new trait, which is ‘fatigued.’
Jack: Mm.
Ali: I think that I’m like, overworking myself in a—a little bit of a…
Janine: Mm.
Ali: a way, here. But you know, it is what it is. This is—it’s make it or break it time. So that’s my first response.
Jack: I am going to take three dice and flirt with the Beloved. [Ali laughs] This is us working on, um… prototypes for animal leg length. I’m not committing to dogs yet. Or, sorry, cats. Or d—I’m not committing to cats or dogs. But—but we’re prototyping, like, maquettes, and, like, you know, how can I get the legs consistent. I think the issue is always, like, posing figures. It’s not like—I mean, obviously Carroway can see if certain legs are longer or shorter than others. But I think it’s like, how can I make the pose look good, and also the legs will be the right length, etc. And I think that’s a real challenge, and I think that that’s something that Dovie is really, you know, able to help with. 
But I think also, it’s just an opportunity for Carroway to, like… talk about, and look back on, the time that they spent with each other, over these last, you know, couple of weeks, or so. Like, back before the whole velvet thing started, back when they hung out in the Glacier Express for the first time, and they didn’t know that Marguerite Crisp was the manager, back before the trip up into the mountains, you know. And I think it’s, like, a moment of reflection for the two of them that is—that is quite an intimate moment.
Ali: Perfect.
Janine: Yeah.
Ali: I think that I am also going to flirt with the Beloved. [laughter] But I think it’s, like, a much more playful way. I think that the—the toys that Mellow are working on are… I think that she’s trying to, like, expand the tail-wagging mechanism to make a trio of, like, toy soldiers that walk together. So it’s like two tails wagging. [laughs] So it’s like, very—it’s much more complicated. [Janine laughs] It’s very ambitious, but she really believes in this project, and thinks that it’ll go over really well. 
[01:00:00]
And I think that it’s, like, her coming over with, like, the prototype that she has for one of the soldiers, one of her old dog toys, and, like… like a mixed drink. It doesn’t—it doesn’t necessarily have to be like alcoholic, but it’s like a… it’s like a seltzer, like a bubbled thing, and it seems like her—
Janine: White Claw. [Ali laughs] Christmas White Claw. Mulled White Claw.
Ali: Fuck off! [Janine laughs]
Jack: Mulled White Claw! [laughter]
Ali: I mean, I think it’s like—it’s like, even more romantic to come over to someone’s shop after it closes, with this, like, really nice punch that you made yourself, right? Where it’s like, oh, you know, I thought that we would—I had all of this extra seltzer because I had to do this anyway, but I also have this, like, jug for us to share, while we’re, you know, working together into the late night! Um…
Janine: [laughs] I’m just thinking about Mellow Aster putting White Claw into white dogs. [laughter]
Jack: Uh-huh! Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Ali: She’s clearly a very chaotic person [laughter] so she would do that. But, yeah, it’s a very, like, you know… come over after it’s closed, cook dinner, have this nice drink together and talk about these—these walking—these walking soldiers. I don’t know that it’s, like… I think it’s… like, it’s basically toy soldiers, but then she’s like, oh, it would be nice if you could do… other things that you associate walking around during holidays.
Janine: Ducks! Ducklings.
Ali: Maybe ducks.
Janine: Little geese.
Ali: Little geese. You know, a little trio of people dressed in their holiday best, so you can, like, you know… if you made a whole holiday town, and you made people walking around, and they were all working, it would be very cute. You know.
Janine: That would be very cute.
Ali: Yada yada. So. That’s my three points. [laughs] My three dice. Jack it’s your—your final response of the game.
Jack: Oh, okay, um. [Ali laughs] [pause] Hm. Okay. I’m going to cross off ‘easily distracted,’ because I think that being given this very structured task that has so much kind of riding on it has… sort of… enabled Carroway to realize the extent to which she has spent the last two weeks basically committed to one goal, which is the pursuance of Dovie’s, like, admiration, and… and respect. And that has been, you know, that has gone through… various lenses, like going up to try to fetch the oranges, and you know, various run-ins with different situations, going flat broke. But I think that, like, I think it’s been a moment where they realized, like, oh, damn, I… in the past, I would have drifted off and worked on something else. But here, as I am right now, you know, focusing on completing a holiday window as part of a weird, kind of, toy-... toy-off, this is something that I’m extremely focused on. So I’m going to cross out ‘easily distracted,’ and… Do I replace it directly, or do I just cross it out?
Ali: You can just cross it out. I, um…
Jack: Okay.
Ali: Yeah. When I cross—we know that there’s been that change, but I don’t think that you get a new trait in response to that.
Jack: Okay. And then I take five die—dice.
Ali: Oh, wait. Replace it with one that substantially changes your character
Jack: Okay.
Ali: that all players agree on. Don’t we.
Jack: So, what about… [pause] I want something more direct than ‘focused,’ because I think ‘focused’ can describe, like, a multiple—multiple—you know, I think Carroway has always been someone with the capacity for focus. I think… [pause] Is—it’s not ‘single-minded.’ Like, what I’m…
Janine: ‘Industrious?’
Jack: Oh, it might be ‘industrious.’ Like, that every task that has been thrown at her, she’s been like, ah, geez, okay. Right, let’s do this.
Ali: Right. Yeah. Or like something in, like, gaining the ability to prioritize?
Jack: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and acting on that.
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: ‘Organized?’ Or…
Jack: ‘Activated.’ Um… [Ali laughs] [pause] It’s fucked up that ‘prioritized’ doesn’t mean ‘someone who has got their priorities in order.’ [laughs]
Janine: Ex—‘Executive?’ 
Ali: Mm. 
Janine: Cause like, ex-
Ali: I mean, you’re right. You’re right.
Janine: Cause like you execute, you’re… [Ali laughs]
Jack: Exe—[laughs] Executive Ibex.
Janine: Not in like, corporate—not in the corporate sense, but in the sense of like, the word on its own. [pause] I think we need to go to WordHippo.
Ali: Yeah. This might be time.
Jack: [pause] It’s like ‘industrious’ and ‘prioritized.’
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: Uh…
Jack: I’m gonna put ‘industrious and prioritized’ in temporarily.
Janine: ‘Driven,’ ‘intensive,’ ‘motivated’...?
Jack: Oh, ‘driven!’ ‘Driven!’
Janine: ‘Driven?’
Jack: Yes, ‘driven!’ Yeah.
Janine: There you go.
Jack: I think—I think that’s absolutely what it is. Especially because I think that ‘driven’ is, is… a close enough antonym, or interesting enough antonym, to ‘easily distracted.’
Ali: Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
Jack: Okay. I’m going to take five.
Ali: Yes.
Jack: One, two, three.
Ali: And, Jack, I kind of want four dice. Do you have a suggestion for me? ‘Something that goes wrong for the active player and a complicating trait that they gain.’
Jack: [pause] Oh! Oh, um… [pause] [laughs] I don’t know exactly what could go wrong, but what if the complicating trait was ‘currently cursed?’ [Ali laughs]
Janine: Oh…
Jack: [laughing] Like, what if the curse—what if the curse begins?
Janine: It’s the first moon, or whatever.
Ali: Oh, yeah. And I didn’t—I was too busy—
Jack: You were too—you were too focused!
Janine: Oh no!
Ali: And I didn’t—I didn’t drink my rose oil. Sure. What kind of curse does Mellow have?
Jack: [pause] Legs uneven length. [Janine laughs]
Ali: God, what is a curse that somebody could have?
Janine: I found a curse generator, but these are all sad. Not sad, but like, a bit intense.
Ali: Yeah. My first thing was like, oh, she turns into a ferret. But then she has to like, make toy, like that’s not what it is. [laughter] Oh! No. So, shoutouts to… I’m gonna give a shoutout to my favorite Webtoon, which is A Good Day to Kiss a Dog? Er, A Good Day to be a Dog, which is about a woman who has a curse where… if she kisses a person, she turns into a dog [laughter] every night, until she kisses that same person again.
Jack: Oh!
Ali: And I really love how…
Jack: It’s a kiss werewolf! [Janine laughs]
Ali: Yeah. I really, like, I love—I’m obsessed with curses that are—involve transformation, have really specific goals like that, and a really specific timeline. So I think what happens to Mellow is that for three hours a day, between the times of… what’s like, the most moderately inconvenient…
Jack: Oh—oh, oh. What about—what about 11 to 3?
Ali: [laughs] AM or PM?
Jack: PM. 11AM to 3PM.
Ali: Yeah, obviously, yeah. I think that [laughing] between the hours of 11AM to 3PM, she turns into a ferret.
Janine: [pause] A ferret?
Ali: [overlapping] I’m right. She turns into a ferret. Yeah. She turns into a ferret.
Janine: Okay.
Jack: Like a long… mouse?
Ali: Yeah. Just, you know, one of those little…
Janine: They’re not mice. [laughs]
Ali: Pointy noses, little beady eyes, very cute. Can be stinky, but not if they’re well bathed. I think that she’s still present. You know, she can still interact with people, she has a human understanding, but she is a ferret for three hours a day. And she is going to be like this… [Jack laughs] is the reversal—um, I thi—we don’t need to know the reversal. Maybe that’ll be an endgame situation. But that is… she is currently cursed. Yeah. There we go.
Jack: God. Flashbacks to Carroway… “What’s the curse?” Mellow: “It’s very private.” Lord. Mellow is a ferret. 
Ali: [laughs] Oh my god, do I strongly recommend A Good Day to be a Dog on Webtoon. I strongly recommend Webtoon for the most, like, out there romances in the world. [Jack laughs] It’s like a very—it’s the best thing. It’s like, a slow-burn romance where she… accidentally kisses a coworker that she doesn’t think that she likes, who’s afraid of dogs. And it’s like them, like, slowly getting to know each other, and him learning to accept dogs, and… [laughs] really recommend it. Have fun on Webtoon, everybody. [Janine laughs] And that’s the final response! [laughs] And now we—now we’re gonna roll these dice! And see who wins. Um.
Jack: Okay!
Ali: Random aside.
Jack: Whoa!
Ali: Oh my god.
Jack: Ali has rolled four 6s already.
Ali: Mm-hm.
Jack: I've rolled one. Two!
Janine: I got no 6s.
Ali: Oh, wow. okay! Um. Perfect. Uh, resolving the Beloved's turn. After all of the [laughs]… Yadda yadda yadda, bububuh. Once the winner has been determined, that player gains points and adds traits to all of the characters. How many points do I get for this one?
Janine: This is a three pointer.
Ali: This is a three pointer? Okay, never mind. Oh, my points are off the charts!
Janine laughs
Ali: I have off the chart points!
Jack: I don't think you get to keep adding them!
[Janine laughs]
Ali: I'm gonna continue to! We'll see how many dice I end up with. Um. I guess it...
Jack: Game ends with Ali rolling 46 dice.
Ali: [laughs] It's so, cuz I, I'm just gonna—cuz I've been—oop, that's not what I've been meaning to do...
Janine: Hit my microphone, sorry.
Ali: That's fine, I drew a big line. I just wanna make sure, I wanna make sure that they all change when I do this. Cuz I, they all do change when I do this, right? Random side... Okay, I've just been having good rolls. Okay, cool. Um. Oh my god, what are our traits? So I... I think that Mellow is feeling like self-assured?
Jack: Mm. "Even as a ferret, I'm crushing this."
Ali: Yeah, exactly, like, she, um, she did  not anticipate this for herself, she is, it's been a very long time since she's not followed up on her sort of curse requirements there, um, and could feel very embarrassed and very ashamed about that, but I think in like, she already feels as though she's been dealing with a lot of like heavy shit right now, and feels like she's been killing it. So I think that she's like you know what, I don't care that I'm a ferret, I have... 21—I don't know that there's 24 hours in this universe, it's fine. I have other hours in the day! I, you know, I still have healthy relationships with my friends and family, even though I'm a ferret. I'm a talented toymaker. I have a killer idea for this window. And I'm good. [laughs] I think that Carroway... how does Carroway feel? What were you—you were... What were you developing? You weren't [inaudible]
Jack: I was like trying to perfect leg length, but like, yeah.
Ali: Okay. Um. It's weird, it's hard to just think of a negative trait and it doesn't even necessarily need to be one, but it does have to be... I think that you're feeling, I think that anxious is probably the most honest thing, I don't wanna paint Carroway as feeling dejected or.
Jack: No.
Ali: You know, feeling as though they're not, um, you know, that they don't have this in the bag or whatever, but there is that feeling of like, oh, there's someone who's of equal skill to me, um, and I don't know that I'm going to make this. Um. So. Yeah, that's the trait that you gain. Um. And uh for Dovie, what's your trait gonna be? [sighs] Um... It's weird, cuz the hurdle for you in this case was your feeling that you're putting a lot of faith into these two people blindly. And I think that the trait that you walk away from here is fulfilled? Which I think is a little different from bolstered, because bolstered was like a personal thing of being like, yknow, this is my shop, I can make this on my own if I really need to. Whereas fulfilled is sort of a thing of being like, even if these two people who I've sort of mentored in this way don't reach the standards that I'm putting forth, I feel that I've really touched their... um. I've touched their lives, I've helped them develop their skills, and that is a real feeling of satisfaction that she has. Um. And that's your trait.
Janine: Okay.
Ending the Game [01:15:30]
Ali: Okay! [laughs] To the endgame... Let me scroll down here. When each player has had three turns, the game concludes. The players collaborally decide on... Describe the climactic scene and set the stage for the final decision about their goals. This is the time to bring up any outstanding issues into, letting the characters and the players tie up loose ends and answer any open questions that they may have... arisen through the game. After the group has set the scene and described the situation, the players roll for their goals, the dream for the Beloved and the prize for the Suitors. Um. Dice for the goals. The players each have a dice pool equal to the number of points they earned towards their goal, as marked on the sheet. Set the scene for the final outcome and describe the situation. Let each player say what their character does to try to accomplish their goal, and then roll the dice to determine the results. Um. And then, yeah! Um. Compare the dice and resolve the rolls in the Suitor and Beloved turns. If one player rolls the highest value on dice or die, they are the sole winner. However, if they have rolled the highest value on the same number of dice, the endgame ties. And then there are rules for what happens if there's a tie. And then there's a little chart here which is, if you're the sole winner, if the Beloved wins, if there's ties... Um. Yeah! I don't know if there's... We, we kind of set up the—I feel like the last hurdle was sort of setting up this final scene?
Jack: Yeah.
Ali: But we can certainly paint more pictures here if there's more, um, if there's holes people don't wanna leave before we do the damn thing.
Janine: Um, I mean I can set the scene for like this... [sighs] It wouldn't be an unveiling of the windows, this would be like a backroom unveiling, right, like this would be, you've both had like a week or two weeks or whatever to work. Let's see what you have, kind of—like, does that make sense for... the preface to like our roll here?
Jack: Yeah, I think so.
Janine: Because this is the thing that decides like who gets a window, and if anything comes of that.
Ali: Yeah, I think that this would be like a private...
Janine: Yeah.
Ali: Um, yeah. Do we need more dice?
Janine: No, it's...
Ali: You have 12 points, I have 12 points, and then Jack has 9, so you need 3 more.
Janine: Oh right, yeah.
Ali: What's the rule? So I'll do that while you're talking.
Janine: Okay. So I'll set the scene here in terms of like how Dovie would frame this, cuz she probably wouldn't want it to be like a really nerve wracking like—she's probably... I would say it's after closing hours. Um. So it's, you know, it's dark outside, the snow is falling and kind of catching the light on the lamps, and the windows are papered over to sort of prepare for  like, they need to be dressed up, um, soon. They need to be dressed up either tonight or tomorrow—tomorrow, probably, tomorrow morning. So they're papered over so that people can't like peek in, and to build suspense and whatever. Um, and to buy time. And so I think Dovie... I don't think she really has any employees. Maybe she has like a couple people who come in now and then, but for the most part I think it's mostly just her. And again, some part timers. So I think here it's like, the store is empty, it is Dovie and Mellow and Carroway, she has like cleared that nice space in the center that's usually used for toys, like kids to play with and test out toys, there's probably a train table and stuff like that there. She's pushed all that stuff to the side, she's given each of them like a table to put whatever they bring on. But she's also set up like a little stand with, I think, some mulled cider, some like warm mulled cider. I think she has set out some like little, some assorted little cakes, from the Glacier Express. I think she has like brought the good padded chairs out from the back, instead of the little rolly chairs that she tends to use, so that everyone can be like comfortable and feel okay. Uh... I think she's also maybe like dressed up a little bit, like she's wearing something that's like slightly fancier than her normal clothes, she just kind of feels like it's a bit of an occasion, even though she can't really put her finger on why. Um. And so I think she maybe leaves Carroway and Mellow, like they have to wait outside cuz she has to unlock the door and bring them in. But then she does that, she meets them at the door and shows them in and offers them lil cakes and cider and shows them the tables and... and says like, "Show me what you've got."
Ali: Oh... Is it time to roll?
Janine: It's time to roll.
Ali: Okay. I have to roll my bottom three die separately cuz I can't figure out how to make them go. [laughs] With all of the other ones. This is gonna be very, it would be very suspenseful for me. Uh. [pause] My dice have been rollen. [coughs] And now you get to go. Oh my god.
Janine: Gonna keep an eye on these bottom three dice as well, in case they're... Oh, they rolled, okay. I mean, the one, I guess the one did, it didn't change. That doesn't mean it didn't roll, I guess.
Ali:  Same with mine, which is weird. Um. Jack, have you rolled?
Jack: I have rolled.
Ali: Oh. Um.
Janine: Oh!
Jack: Yep.
Ali: So we have—oh, wait, okay, wait. Uh. Wow! Okay.
Janine: We have a tie. Don't we?
Ali: Yeah, we do have a tie. Um, ties are allowed in the endgame, they are not broken, players can tie. There may be two winners, or they all lose. So yeah, we have two 6s and we tie! Um. Ties for the win, uhh, if the--
Janine: It also—wait, it counts as a tie even if you only get one 6, right? Or no?
Ali: Yes, yes yes—so if we each, if all three of us had one 6 it would be a, it would be a three-way tie. But because we both have two 6s, we, we tie.
Janine: Okay. This example, they give an example that's like two 6s, one 6, and and then two 6s and I feel like that's a confusing example. Anyway, it's, yeah.
Ali: Mm-hm. um. Yeah. Uh... If the Suitor players tie, neither—wait. If the Suitors play—[laughs] players tie, neither of them win! Um, the Beloved player narrates how the obstacles of the world blocked the Suitors—[alarmed] oh my god!!
Janine: [disappointed] Oh...
Ali: Um. The Suitor players describe how they, um, how what they have become defines their own characters' stories, and what the direction—and what direction they follow after this loss. The Beloved player neither wins nor loses, the Beloved is simply still on their journey. The Beloved player narrates the epilogue of how the Beloved continues to work toward their dream. Oh my god!! [laughs] That's fine.
Janine: So. So, I, hm. So a tie doesn't like... A tie just means there's nothing, it's not like they knock each other out and then my 6 counts as a win.
Ali: Right, yeah. No no no, yeah, so if it had been a situation where, um, you and one of the Suitors tied, both of you would obtain your goal and then there would be the losing Suitor, but I guess because both of us had the same goal, um, and we both don't get it. And because you didn't win, you don't achieve your dream.
[Both laugh]
Janine: That's...
Jack: Now hang on!
Janine: I don't—
Ali: If there was—yeah, I don't know! It's funny, cuz if there was a three way tie we would have all failed. Um. Which... is funny to me. I didn't design this game.
Janine: I don't think this is how relationships work, IMO!
Ali: Mm-hm! Well!
Janine: Everyone did a little too good, so you're all miserable.
Jack: I have some terrible news. [laughs] No one gets the window!
Ali: Um. We've certainly been loosey-goosey with these rules. And if e wanna say that, um—I think that there's a way to say, you know, they each get a window but neither of them feels the personal accomplishment that they thought they would, is a way to go about this. Or we can do it as written, and, you know, you, you know, it's, you know. I don't know! [laughs] I do think that there's probably a version of this of Dovie being like, you know, I don't, it was really great to know both of you and I don't think that either of your creations are there yet, and then we get Dovie—yeah.
Janine: No, I hate that. I hate that—here—I hate that, and this is a self-indulgent holiday game where...
[Ali laughs]
Janine: Where none of us have to feel pressured to do the thing that's like realistic and sad.
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: I also don't want to break the rules outright. Um.
Jack: Right, yeah. What is the—
Janine: I actually wanna cheese this, is the thing.
Ali: [laughs] Cheesing is allowed. I, you know, this is, I've been the facilitator here and I'm, you know, giving you the go ahead. [laughs]
Janine: So, the way that I wanna cheese this, you know, both Suitors, their prize is window in toymaker's shop. I think what I'm putting forward as the thing that happens is that asking someone to design a toy and then create enough toys to fill a window in the span of like, two weeks at most but probably like one week, is a lot to ask for? And like I think it's one of those things where Dovie is maybe a bit too close to realize how much she's asking, cuz she's like, she's been at this for a while, she kind of knows how to measure her time out a little more—she also knows how to fill out a window, whereas she's working with people who are used to filling out stalls, like they're used to having a smaller—having space for a smaller array of stuff. I think there are things that she did not prepare them for in that sense. So my suggestion for what happens is that they both made what felt to them like a suitable amount, but it's actually only enough to fill up half the window, so Dovie suggests that they share the window, and the other window will have like a diorama with like a Santa mannequin or something.
[Ali laughs]
Janine: So that way neither of them is getting the full window, really, they are both sharing it, they're not like—yeah.
Jack: There's a sting to it, right, cuz it's like, there's a sting to the compromise of being like, [sighs] I have to, I have to, I have to work with this person.
Janine: They've been low key rivals for this whole thing.
Jack: [amused] Low key—
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: And now it is this thing of like, now neither of them fully gets the glory, and I mean, also, y’know, Dovie doesn't get what she wants in terms of like, neither of these toys that she was really banking on really can make a dent, because there just aren't enough of them to go around even if they sell out. It's good that they sold out, but there's only so many of them. It can't be the hot toy if there's only a couple dozen. For the entire town.
Jack: Right. Yes. And—
Ali: Yeah.
Jack: Yeah.
Ali: I feel comfortable with this.
Jack: Yeah...
[Ali laughs]
Janine: And it's also, it's not a complete, it's not a full stop here, right, like it's, neither one of them, Dovie has not looked at either one of them and said, like, you, I want you to be my new partner, but there's, you know, this ends with an ellipses of like, this relationship still exists, it's just, we didn't see the full extent of it.
Ali: Right, yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
Jack: Right.
Janine: We didn't see the end point, we saw the first, like, test. The first trial.
Ali: Um, yeah, I think that's part of what's interesting in the way that this system works and that the way that this kind of outcome works, is that like, yeah, the players have always had a really clear goal. But in the course of the game, there's, it's understandable that those goals change, um, that the sort of like, bar for success changes in their lives, I think it certainly has for Mellow. And I think, you know, Carroway has also grown as a professional. Um. So it's, you know, there's the disappointment, there's the sting of like, you know, you look at the shop and you think to yourself, like, that is what I wanted.
Jack: Right.
Ali: But. You know. You don't always get what you want. [laughs and coughs] Oh my god, my throat is like, why are you a podcaster?
Janine: Yeah, we've been going for a few hours!
Ali: But I don't know why! Um! So. I think on that note, unless anybody has other final shots, um, for their characters? Which I think we should probably do. Um. 
[01:30:00]
This has been, um, Shooting the Moon. Um. I think for Mellow, her reaction to this is... There definitely is a sort of a dejection, um, because it's hard to really work really hard for something and not get it and then also be like, to be able to look back on the effort that you put into something and think, I—you know, she's a ferret right now! [laughs] She's a ferret for three hours a day, and she's also really fatigued, it's like, I worked really hard, I didn't get it, and like also I, um, I think that there's a part of her that is trying to figure out the ways that she can—not limit herself, but sort of identify the situations and the reactions that she has to things that she feels are overblown, um, and thinks that as she... improves on that she will become a better designer as well. Um. Yeah. [laughs] I think her toys look sick though, I think that they walk fine, the mechanism is fucking cool as hell. You don't have to wind—like, it's a thing that walks around your house that you don't have to wind up, no one's ever seen that before, and it, you know, it owns. But yeah.
Jack: I think that--
Janine: I also wanna hear about Carroway's toy, in this, heads up.
Jack: Oh yeah. Um.
Janine: Gotta know.
Jack: I think that Carroway is just like also like feeling this frustration of having worked toward something—and also, you know, the... like, Carroway has been shooting to be like looked up to by Dovie, you know, as they look up to Dovie, and I think that sort of going like oh wow, I fell short at this last hurdle stings, but I think that as they are kind of like carefully stacking their toy in the window along with Mellow's, they are thinking about Linus, the meeting with Hexed Linus that's going to happen in a couple of days, they're thinking about the new strudels, the new cakes that are on offer, they're thinking about, you know, further down the road, the springtime celebrations that are gonna happen when the snow melts up in the mountains. And I think that like perhaps their single mindedness that they acquired in this last awful push is just like, wow, um, you know, maybe I was too—maybe I spent the last two weeks too, too focused on one particular thing. There are other, there are other things out here for me to look toward. Not least of which is the like, the turning of the year and the snow melting.
[Ali laughs]
Jack: And Carroway's toy is, um, Carroway has been, you know, stick to what you know well, which is, make some really incredible looking cats. Really well designed cats. Legs, even length, brilliant. But! You know, taking into account the variability, the experience with variability of the legs being different lengths, allow for a kind of modularity in the toy creation that lets people customize their cats in the shop prior to purchase.
Ali: Hoh!
Jack: So a kind of, a kind of magical alchemical Build-a-Bear.
Janine: Mm!
Ali: Um.
Janine: Uh, so, I think the last shot of Dovie... um, is, y’know, she works the shop for the holidays, it's like, not the best season they've had. It's like, it's good enough that they're afloat for now, but not good enough that she's like not worried, in the same way that she was at the start. But like I think we get a shot of her like as the last customers kind of filter out of the store, on just some random day of the week. She like sits down at the front desk and like pulls—she has like a little, a lil tiny notebook on her chatelaine and a little pencil pinned to her skirt, and I think she sort of pulls those up, um, to hand and she's got like some sketches in there. And there's two, there are two that are way more developed than the others. One of them, um, one of them is a sort of like, a little witch with a musical mechanism, so it's like a little singing witch doll. And the other is a little walking Saint Bernard with kind of an ugly saggy face, but.
[Ali laughs]
Janine: It like trots around. And I think she's like basically, she's developing ideas that she could present to collaborate with.
Ali: Yeah!
Jack: Yeah.
Winding Down [01:36:00]
Ali: Perfect. Yeah. So this has been [clears throat]...
Janine: My goodness, we all need tea. [laughs]
[Jack laughs]
Ali: Um, no, I'm here, we're good.
Janine: Yeah? Mm-hm.
Ali: [laughs] Um, this has been Shooting the Moon, by Emily Care Boss, um, again, I got this as a part of the Romance trilogy, which I very strongly recommend—
Janine: It's neat.
Ali: I will just say that I scrolled, um, far enough down at the end of this game to get to Otherworlds: Alone Against the World, a mod for Shooting the Moon, a tabletop roleplaying game for one player. “Embattled and striving against your past, a rival, and the land itself.” Um, so this book is worth the fucking nine dollars that I paid for it. Um. Cuz not only does it have this game, it has two other games and also like a bunch of really cool hacks for them. For one people or six people or more people or whatever else, so. Thank you to Emily. Thank you to everybody for joining us. I loved this system!
Jack: Yeah. This is great.
Janine: Yeah.
Ali: I don't want it to feel like, meh, um, it didn't end up the way that we wanted it to, cuz I do think that like designing games is tough and there was, you know, there was probably, I don't think that, you know, Emily has never heard of a polyamorous relationship, and there's some reasons it was designed this way, you know! Especially when you think of like, this game as being something going for a goal, I feel sort of satisfied with, um,
Jack: Right.
Janine: Yeah.
Ali: you know, not everybody gets exactly what they wanted. Um. So thank you so much, this has been Live at the Table, thank you so much for supporting us on Patreon. Thanks for watching, thanks for listening, um, I have been and continue to be Alicia Acampora. [laughs] You can find me at @ali_west on twitter.com, you can find friends_table at... you can, no.
