Bluff City 14: When Justice Is Done Pt. 2
Transcriber: Cole
[Jack de Quidt’s “When Justice is Done” begins playing]
Austin (as Hector): I find myself thinking a lot about masks these days. Bluff City. And the people- the people who wear them. Maybe it’s all these masquerades I’ve been seein’ pop up around the shore recently. Have you been to any of those? Those fancy galas? The ballroom soirées? No? What? They don’t send out those uh, fancy calligraphy invitations to folks workin’ the late night shift like you and me. [light laugh] Heh. No. No. Of course they don’t. Folks like us. We don’t need masks, do we? We don’t need masks. We… One second. I got a call comin’ in, and it looks like, it is from one of my very favorite people. 
Jack (as Florence): Hector. Hector, this is Florence. Hector, are you ok?
Austin (as Hector): Florence. It is so good to hear from you. It has been too long. What’s on your mind tonight?
Jack (as Florence): Hector, can you hear me? We’re coming for you, Hector. I promise.
Austin (as Hector): Now Florence, you know I have a lot of complicated feelings about art. I mean it connects to what I was just talking about. The mask. Did you know that when Portugese sailors first sailed down towards Africa, and they started seeing tribal cultures with uh, jewelry and small statues and masks, they looked at those, and they said, ‘Now that. That right there. That is uh- That is fetishism.’ Not in the way that you and I might mean that word today. A different way. They were saying that these people that they were putting uh, a fantastical- a mystical- a false presence into the things that they made. Now I’m not sayin’ that each of those sailors was a skeptic, of course. Some of them believed in the power of faith regardless of which god you’re praying to, but by and large, they looked at those tribesmen, and they said, ‘You fools. God is not in a mask. God is not in a necklace. You are inserting the holy where there is nought.’
Jack (as Florence): [almost inaudible in the background] Hector, are you ok?
Austin (as Hector): And yet, what would these self-same sailors do when they went back to their quarters that night? Take out the rosary.
Jack (as Florence):  [quietly in the background] Can you hear me? 
Austin (as Hector): Say one Hail Mary for this bead. And Our Father for that one. 
Jack (as Florence):  [quietly] This is Florence. Hector, are you ok?
Austin (as Hector): And the necklace wasn’t nothing. 
Jack (as Florence):  [quietly] We’re coming for you. 
Austin (as Hector): It was the channeling device. It was-
Jack (as Florence):  [quietly] Hector, can you hear me?
Austin (as Hector): -something in the mind to connect you closer to God. 
Jack (as Florence):  [quietly] This is Florence.
Austin (as Hector): And this hypocrisy has continued to today. 
Jack (as Florence):  [quietly] Are you ok? Hector, are you ok?
[Music growing louder] 
Austin (as Hector): Those same folks would go out to those masquerade balls, and morning’s light-
Jack (as Florence):  [quietly] We’re coming. 
Austin (as Hector): -will tell you that you are the deceiver.
Jack (as Florence):  [growing louder in the background] We’re coming for you. I promise. 
Austin (as Hector): That you are the one who is hiding things from them- 
Jack (as Florence):  [growing louder in the background] We’re on our way.
Austin (as Hector): -because of the way you dress-
Jack (as Florence):  [growing louder] Hector, this is Florence.
Austin (as Hector): [growing quieter] -or the way you use language differently. But we all adorn ourselves-
Jack (as Florence):  Hector, are you there?
Austin (as Hector): [quieter] -with ourselves.
Jack (as Florence):  We’re coming for you. I promise. 
Austin (as Hector): [quieter] There is paint in front of us all. This sculpture. Architecture. All the different… [becomes inaudible]
Jack (as Florence): Hector… Hector…. Hector, this is Florence. Hector, are you ok? Hector, we’re coming for you…. Hector, can you hear me? This is Florence. Hector, are you ok? …. We’re coming for you…..Hector, can you hear me? This is Florence. Hector, this is Florence. Hector, this is Florence. Hector, this is Florence. Hector, this is Florence. [Music grows quieter] Hector, this is Florence. Hector, this is Florence. Hector, are you there? …. We’re coming for you. I promise. [Music ends] Hector.

Um… does anyone want to give me a quick recap of the first session?
Keith: Pass. 
Austin: Wow. [Keith laughs] 
Janine: [light laugh] Wow. 
Austin: Quick. 
Jack: Damn, that’s amazing. 
[crosstalking]
Keith: Yeah, yeah, I was-
Jack: Right out of the gate. 
Keith: Mhm. 
Jack: That’s a powerful move. 
Austin: You just say no to anything. Yeah. [Jack laughs] 
Janine: So, is- there’s a shark lady. 
[crosstalking]
Austin: There’s a shark lady. 
Jack: Yeah, she’s called Thresher. 
Janine: Um…
Austin: She’s called Thresher. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Keith: We fought her-
Janine: [interjecting] She also does illusions.
Keith: We fought her and her gang of toadies, boot-lickers, and uh… [Austin laughs] and hangers-on? [light laugh] What’s the last one?
Austin: God, I don’t even remember. There were at least num- There were a number of them, yeah. Um… did they have a name? Did they-
Janine: Henchmen?
Austin: Henchmen, for sure. 
Jack: They were… they were uh, robbing a casino kind of security van. 
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: And we’ve been tipped off to this uh… casino security van robbing by a man called Mr. E. Masque, which was a pun that I got only on relistening. 
Austin: Oh Jack. 
Janine: What!? [Keith laughs] Didn’t you say-
Keith: What!?
Janine:-you loved the-
Austin: No, that was Art. 
Janine: I thought- I thought you would’ve-
Austin: Art said it. 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: Art said he loved it. 
Janine: Ok. 
Keith: [over Austin] Lackeys.
Austin: Pretty sure.
Keith: Sorry, it’s lackeys. 
Austin: Or… Oh, lackeys. Thank you. 
Janine: Mm. 
Austin: Maybe Jack said that they liked it, but they just meant, ‘Oh yeah, good name.’
Jack: Yeah, I think- I mean I got that it was… [exhales] I got the Mask bit cause I kind of knew we were sup- [Janine laughs] But I got the- I failed the most important bit of the pun. [Austin laughs] Anyway-
Art: [over Jack] Keith.
Jack: -all this is to say...
Art: [interjecting] Keith, you are off the hook. You not getting whatever weight- counterweight thing is now not the biggest-
Keith: Wait, what?
[crosstalking]
Austin: Wait. What?
Art: -goof. 
Keith: Which COUNTER/weight thing did I not get?
Art: There’s some thing… there’s some… there’s some like, moment in COUNTER/weight where you wee like- like, ‘Oh... ‘ I don’t know. I saw this on the-
Austin: Weight-counterweight?
Art: Yeah, like… [Austin breathes a laugh] There’s some like, moment in COUNTER/weight where it appears that you did not understand that Counterweight and Weight were… 
Keith: Oh. There- That can’t be true. I’m willing to be proved wrong. [Jack laughs quietly] Someone- someone very industrious out there can go and prove me wrong. I would love that. Um….
Jack: Keith is saying, ‘check the tapes.’
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Check the tapes. [Janine laughs] Roll ‘em back. 
Austin: We have ‘em. Tapes are out there. 
Keith: Yeah. 
[crosstalking]
Jack: Anyway…
Austin: On a whim, just relisten to COUNTER/weight. 
Keith: Luckily, it’s- it’s act-
Austin: Ya know? Not that long uh-
Keith: By definition there are tapes. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: The- The reason that I mention Mr. E. Masque is that uh, at the end of the… at the end of the kind of mission, we got a- sort of a flash to Thresher somewhere deep under Bluff City, perhaps maybe in a sort of a lair. 
Austin: It was definitely a lair of some sort. 
Art: Perhaps. 
Jack: Being angry. Angry that she hadn’t gotten all of the money. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Or something else. Was it angry that she hadn’t gotten all of the money? She was like, ‘I need this money.’
Austin: Yes. She has a big reason to- She needs money. And...
Jack: And then this figure was like, ‘Don’t worry. There will be more money soon. I have a lead for you.’ [excitedly] And it was Mr. E. Masque!
Austin: It was Mr. E. Masque. Yeah. Exactly. Totally. 
Keith: Playin’ both sides. 
Austin: So- But you don’t know that. Playing both sides.
Jack: No. No. No. 
[crosstalking] 
Keith: Be- or being both sides?
Jack: But we know that. 
Austin: We know. Um, yeah, being both sides? 
Keith: You know. 
Austin: Hard to say. Hard to say which way. We should note- I’m pretty sure Grouse, you know the history with Mr. E. Masque. Did we- did I… Did we talk about that at all?
Janine: What? No.
Keith: No. 
Janine: I thought he was just some like...
Austin: Ok. 
Janine: -like… uh… I- Hm… I want to say the thing with him was that he’s like, kind of a…. He did some crimes, but is not like-
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: -explicitly a crime- a crimo. 
Austin: He did some crimes. Waxwing didn’t ever deal with him. Goldfinch dealt with him. That may have come up. It may not have. It’s in my notes. It has been over a month since we’ve recorded, so I can’t quite remember what came up, and I have not- We are deep in Hieron recording mode.
Art: [over Austin] It doesn’t feel that long. 
Austin: I- Yeah, I know. I know it doesn’t. And yet…
Keith: None of it does. [light laugh] But here we are.
Austin: But here we are. [light laugh] Four years in. Um…
Art: Just like, six months ago when we recorded the first episode of Hieron. [light laugh] 
[Austin, Keith, and Janine laugh]
Austin: Yeah, that’s- Yeah. Exactly. Um… so other stuff? There was a clue. You got some clues. Do people remember what the clues were you got for Thresher?
Jack: Um, it was something to do with the fact that the manhole cover was- was weird. Was that one of the clues?
Austin: That’s one of the clues. Yeah. 
Jack: It was sort of illusory. Um…
Keith: Was it-? Wait. Wasn’t it something-
[crosstalking]
Austin: The hole was-
Keith: The tunnel was weird?
Austin: Yeah, there was no tunnel. 
Keith: The hole was….
Austin: It looked like-
Keith: Right. 
Austin: -there’d been a tunnel where she like, popped out of the ground, but in fact, what she had done was climbed up a manhole like, sewer grate situation. 
Jack: And we had seen that.
Janine: Was I supposed to think of a… detail for her? I have like, a big thing… in my notes that says, plus some detail question mark- question mark. 
Austin: What are the…?
Janine: And there’s like, a big square around it. 
Austin: What are the other things you have written down?
Janine: [over Austin] I feel like I was supposed to provide you some kind of information. [light laugh] Um...
Austin: Yeah, but I think you have- You have a move called Been Reading the Files which is where you can provide information- 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: -about a… a- [reading] ‘On a hit, tell the team about one important detail you learned from your studies. The GM will tell you what if anything seems different from what you remember.’ Um, and I don’t remember… 
Janine: So, the thing here- Here are the notes I have about Thresher. 
Austin: Yes. 
Janine: Uh, she’s relatively new. She was empowered by that weird meteor shattering situation.
Austin: Yep. Dragonballs, etcetera, 
Janine: Um… She- I wrote brash robber, which I don’t know [laughing] if you- if those were your words or mine. Um, an illusionist with a tail, and she slaps people with it. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: And… con artist?
Austin: Con artist. 
Janine: I just wrote con artist. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Is it too late to start over, and I can make a hero whose real name is Brash Robber? [Austin and Janine laugh] And I- and I have to come up with a different hero name?
Austin: I’ll add it to my list of names that I’ll then forget who they were supposed to be. [Keith and Janine laugh] 
Jack: Should we know that she’s pretty um… She’s pretty laissez-faire with- with the lives of the people she’s attacking. Um… she like pulled that guy out of the- out of the thing and was like, ‘If you come towards me, I’ll kill him!’
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: And then he was not in a good shape by the time she was done. 
Austin: Uh, I will add that she was acting out of fear during that exchange. Um, so I want to be clear that she didn’t come across as her being like, ‘Human lives mean nothing to me,The Thresher.’
Keith: I… I can’t remember if this was part of what we already talked about today um…
Austin: Mhm. 
Keith: But you saying that made me remember that like, the um… like, the reason that… that Mr. E. Masque kept on reassuring her about the money was like- like she was- is- Was this like, a bigger job than she normally did or like, a different kind of job?
Austin: [heavy sigh] 
Keith: Was there something about that?
Austin: I think it was more of… um… Eh, I think this is in line with the types of jobs she had done. 
Keith: Ok. 
Austin: And the next job is definitely gonna be bigger than what she normally does. Maybe this is more public than what she normally does. But again, it has been two months since we recorded, and I have not personally had time to go back and relisten because of Hieron launch stuff. Um, I just have my notes, and I don’t have that particular note. Uh, there’s one other big piece, which is about something else you found at the crime scene or maybe in the sewers.
Jack: Oh! Oh!
Austin: Someone went back to the sewers.
Jack: We found like a- a flier. 
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: Um, for… 
Austin: A coupon actually. 
Jack: -for… um, for like, a Roll um… Rollin’s- Um… Rolling Cart.
Austin: Whatever you say is gonna be better, but-
Jack: Rollin’s Rolling- Roll and Go? It was like- it was like a rolling thing, right?
Janine: Like boardwalk carts. 
Austin: Yes. They’re- they’re boardwalk pushcarts. Yeah, rolling car- rolling chairs. You know what these are? Like, are you familiar with these?
Jack: Mayb? I don’t- I’m gonna Google bo- What should I Google to get this?
Austin: I’m gonna- I’m gonna- I’m just gonna post it. 
Janine: Is it like a wheelbarrow full of tourists?
Austin: Basically. 
Art: Oh, do you mean like a… Nope, that’s not what I was thinking. 
Jack: Oh, like a kind of a… 
Austin: I linked an image. 
Jack: -sort of like a… [typing] I want to make sure I’m saying the right thing. Yeah, kind of like a rickshaw-
Keith: It’s-
Jack: -sort of?
Austin: Sort of.
Keith: It’s like a gol- it’s a golf cart, but for a boardwalk. 
[crosstalking]
Austin: Yeah. No, but a person…
Keith: It fits like, eight people. 
Art: Is someone ever gonna be in the front seat?
Austin: A person pushes it from behind. 
Art: Oh, so that- That’s the employee- er the- the…
Jack: Oh, so these are empty?
Austin: Those are empty ones. Yes. 
Keith: Oh, I’ve seen a- I’ve- I’ve mostly only seen electric ones. 
Austin: Yeah, no. These are like, Atlantic City does this for real, for real all the time, and it’s- My dad used to do this. My dad used to push these. 
Janine: Oh. 
Austin: Uh, it’s like a- like, it’s one of those jobs that like, ‘Hey, if you’re- If you want to work in the summer, and you are like, twenty-two, and you have a strong enough back to- to fuckin’ push people around the boardwalk for six hours, eight hours-’
Keith: Oh boy. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: How long does that strong back last?
Austin: Ba- Not long. 
Janine: Hmmm.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: And also if you want to get paid nothing. So yeah, what you found is a coupon for-
Art: [interjecting] I like that you linked us to a picture with like, two like, smaller framed women- [Austin laughs] and then it’s like, ‘My dad, basketball player…’ [laughs] 
Austin: [laughs] Yeah, listen. 
Art: ‘Kevin Walker used to do this.’
Austin: Yeah. Uh huh. Um… I’m sure- I’m sure it’s- I’m sure the wheels help a lot, ya know? It’s not- They probably have better wheel tech these days. 
Keith: Yeah, I have not seen these. I- I’ve seen like, little like- like, six seater golf carts. 
Austin: Mm. Yeah, no. That’s different. That’s-that’s- We don’t have those in A.C. We got- we got… We got fuckin’ pushcarts with people inside. And also like, they do them in the rain. They have tops for the rain. It sucks. I mean listen. Get paid, you know? Do- do make rent. So. 
Keith: For- for the record, if you’re thinking about ri- driving a rickshaw in Providence, that’s also a scam. Don’t do that. 
Austin: Oh wow. Is it a scam?
Keith: Yeah, there’s like this like, fake uh… I know- I only know about it because I live here. But like, there’s a company that talks up being like, a work co-op and that you make your own hours, and actually it’s a big fucking scam. Uh, for rickshaw driving. 
[0:15:00]
Austin: Yeah, that sounds- that sounds right. 
Keith: Mhm. 
Austin: Um, the coupon found-
Art: [over Austin] I don’t think anyone in the history of the world was having a good gig as a rickshaw driver. 
Austin: Probably not. 
Art: I think that’s always been a bad gig. 
Austin: The coupon you found was two dollars off from Royce’s Rollcarts. And it had a motto on it which was, ‘If you’re rollin’, it’s gotta be Royce.’ If you’re- Sorry. ‘If you’re rolllin’ in quotes, [Jack laughs] ‘it’s gotta be-’ it’s gotta be also in quotes, ‘Royce.’ So, that is-
Janine: They definitely got a cease and desist at some point and had to go to a way worse motto, right?
Austin: Oh, maybe. Maybe? Maybe he just thought this was good. I don’t know. Um… listen, I’ve known those people. I’ve worked in this- in this city. They are people who just put quotes on things cause they think it’s like, capital letters, but polite. Um- [light laugh] 
Jack: It’s from the, ‘We don’t want fall, we want more’ school of slogan writing, right?
Austin: A hundred percent. Yeah. 
Keith: One of my fav- There is a- there is a…
Austin: ‘Two is too few.’ [light laugh] 
Keith: -a small- this small convenience store, and they had a sign that said that uh, ‘If you’re buying tobacco, we card.’ But ‘we card’ was in quotes. [Austin, Janine, and Keith laugh] That part of like, ‘we ID’ was in quotes was very funny. 
Austin: Wink. [Keith laughs] Perfect. 
Keith: It’s like, professionally typeface. It was like, a real sign; it wasn’t handwritten or anything. 
Austin: God. Some other little small things. Uh, y’all… I guess you went back to base and like, compared notes. I know Grouse, you kind of got a talking to by um, by your mentor. By Waxwing. 
Janine: Mhm. 
Austin: Which adjusted one of your stats. We should go over really quick, what your- just what your labels are currently and then what your bonds are. Your- your um- What are they actually called? They’re not called bonds, are they? They- Are they not even bonds? It’s just…
Art: It’s um-
Austin: Influence over?
Art: Influence. Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah, yeah. So, let’s go over- let’s go over- Let’s start with you, Mr. Good. Franklin Bano. Keith Carberry. 
Keith: Hello. Yep. 
Austin: What are your labels and who do you have influence over?
Keith: Uh, my labels- I have got- Let’s go top to bottom. Three in Savior. Um, two in Mundane. Negative one in Danger. Negative one in Freak. And I missed zero in Superior. 
Austin: There you go. And who do you have influence over?
Keith: Influence over…. Paternoster. 
Austin: Cool. And then for you, you’re specific thing is these drives. Do you have any of these four that you’ve taken that you’ve completed. Did we miss any of those at the end of the last session?
Keith: Um… I don’t… think I did any of these.
Austin: Ok. Do you wanna… read what they are just so we have them in our heads?
Keith: Yeah, sure. So, my drives- Does everyone have drives? I thought everyone had-
Austin: No, this is just a-
Keith: Oh ok. 
Austin: This is just a thing for Beacon. 
Keith: So, this is for-
Austin: Beacon is all about like, doing stuff that superheroes do-
Keith: Like, that you’re-
Austin: -because they’re not actually superhero- Cause they’re not-
Keith: Right. 
Austin: They’re don’t have superpowers, you know?
Keith: Yeah, like- Yeah, yeah. Um, ok. So, my drives are [reading] ‘Help a teammate when they most need me. Take down a threat all on your own. Stop a fight with calm words. And reject someone who tells you you shouldn’t be here.’ 
Austin: Cool. Uh, Grouse? Can I get your labels and then your influence stuff?
Janine: Yeah. Um… I have a one in Freak. Zero Dange. One in Savior. Two in Superior. Minus one in Mundane. 
Austin: Ok. 
Janine: And I have influence over Paternoster [pāte-er-nos-ter] and Mr. Good. 
Austin: Ok. Um-
Janine: Paternoster? [pah-ter-nos-ter]
Austin: I don’t- I think-
Janine: I’m always gonna say Paternoster. [pāte-er-nos-ter] [laughs] 
Austin: Eh. It happens. Uh… [thinking sounds] doo-doo-duh- Um…  [thinking sounds] tchoo-tchoo-tchoo. Paternoster, you go next. 
Jack: Um, I have Freak one. Danger minus one. Savior one. Superior one. Mundane one. And I have influence over The Champ and Mr. Good. 
Austin: Ok. Uh… perfect. 
Keith: You got ones in everything? Geez. 
Austin: Lot of ones and- and minus ones, so nothing especially good, but lots of thi- I mean, they’re labels. Labels change. 
Keith: Oh. Oh, wait. Jack, what was your minus one? I just- I thought everything was one. I was like, that’s bizarre. 
Jack: Uh, my minus is Danger. 
Keith: Ok. 
Austin: As a reminder, those change when- Those can change in a number of different ways. Those can change when someone tells you to- to change them. When someone with influence over you is like, ‘Hey, you should- you should… you should change that. You should be more superior than other people.’ Um, in which case, they- you adjust what those labels are. And then the other time is when you reject when someone tried to use influence over you, you can- you can do that. Likewise, if you get- If there’s a situation where you have influence over someone- over a teammate, and then you would shift- er and then you want- you would get more influence over them, you uh, shift one of their labels up and one of their labels down. Your choice. So like, let’s say- lt’s say Grouse has influence over- over um, Paternoster, and then would get more influence, you can’t get more than one influence, and so Paternoster, Grouse would tell you which labels to shift at that point. 
Keith: And you can’t resist that one?
Austin: I think you could because that’s when someone… when you reject someone’s influence. Yeah, you would- could totally roll to try to tune them out, basically. 
Keith: Ok. And can you choose to disre- to- to disregard that?
Austin: If you-
Keith: Or do you just-?
Austin: If you reject their influence and roll successfully. 
Keith: No, no. Sorry. I mean like, if I got a second influence of Jack’s character-
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: -could I be like, ‘No, I’m just going to throw it away.’
Austin: No. No. 
Keith: I have-
Austin: You have- If you have influence over a teammate and you would gain influence over them again, immediately shift one of their labels, as like- Yeah, you have to do it. Because that’s what the effect of influence is. Um… which is just a reminder that like, all of those things are so flexible. Like, this is not-
Keith: Yeah. Mhm. 
Austin: -like Dungeon World where it’s just supposed to go up. They should be flexing around. They should be moving. Uh, The Champ.
Art: Hey. 
Austin: Elena Flores.
Art: Freak is one. Danger is three. Savior is minus one. Superior is one. And Mundane is minus one. 
Austin: Ok. And you have influence…
Art: I have influence over Paternoster and Mr. Good. 
Austin: And that’s because they are your love and your rival, respectively, right?
Art: That is correct, and that is my… that is my thing. 
Austin: Ok. 
Art: That’s what I do.
Austin: Um, last specific thing here is you have men- a mentor’s resources. You have- you have the resources of Waxwing at your disposal because of um… the Grouse- er just Grouse. Do you remember what those are?
Janine: It’s- I think we have like, access to like, res- Ok, hidden base, a weapon of last resort, and a vehicle. Right. Here we go. 
Austin: Yes. The hidden-
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: -the hidden base is uh- We now know the name of it because Jack named it. [light laugh] In the- in the episode description of the first one. It is- it is ‘Saltwater Pier’ -er I guess it’s- it’s an arcade on Saltwater Pier, which is like, an amusement pier. I’m calling the arcade The Double Tilt Arcade. And then the...
Keith: [interjecting] Cheaters welcome!
Austin: [laughs] Right. Uh, love it. Love- love cheaters. And then the vehicle is that like, amphibious car thing, right? Um, and then we don’t know what the-
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: -weapon of last resort is. There’s- there is a weapon of last resort, as part of your vehicle, and you don’t know what it does. It’s just like a- It’s basically just an emergency button that Waxwing has given you. 
[crosstalking] 
Jack: We also have-
Janine: Yeah, it’s like a- ‘use this if you think you’re gonna get fuckin’ [laughs] killed’ kind of.
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. 
Jack: We also have like, one thousand uh, cheap flip phones. [Janine laughs] 
Austin: Right. Yes. Yes. 
Jack: Just like, in like, shopping carts- 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: -that are in the arcade.
Austin: [laughs] Yeah, cause otherwise you’ll get caught, you know? Keep those secret- keep those identities secret. 
Janine: Are they in shopping carts or are they in like, a shitty claw machine, and we just kind of pop one out when we need it? 
[crosstalking]
Jack: [laughs] They’re in a claw machine.
Janine: Cause I think that’s a little less obvious. 
Jack: They’re- Yeah, they’re in like a- Well, I don’t know. Do we have any- Are we- Do we have like… I bet we have like, arcade machines down in our hideout that like- They were broken arcade machines that we have somehow managed to get working or haven’t. 
[crosstalking]
Austin: Yeah, I think that that’s-
Jack: I think we’ve got a claw machine down here. 
Austin: Mhm. Mhm. 
Jack: We’re teens underneath an arcade. Like… we have to have an arcade machine. 
Austin: Yeah, you have some arcade machines. Yeah, you tell me whatever they are. Um… ok. I think that that’s everything we needed to know to jump back in. Oh, I guess, last thing that I almost said before and then forgot is that Thresher was um… One of the things that she kept hitting on was like, ‘Why do you care if I rob a casino?’ [light laugh] ‘Like, these people are rich assholes. Like, I’m not. Let me have this money, please.’ [laugh] And that was- That’s just an important character trait to- to keep in mind as we go forward. So, I think we probably open back up. It’s probably been a day. People have recovered and- and gotten back on their feet. I don’t think anybody has any negative conditions currently, right? Or does anybody still have one? [pauses] Uh, Grouse still had Insecure, it looks like.
Janine: Oh…
Austin: Um, but I think that those clear… with time, I’m pretty sure. [reading] ‘You can always clear a condition by taking a certain action. At the end of a scene in which you take the corresponding action, clear that condition.’ So, no. You have not cleared it yet. You have Insecure, and so to clear Insecure, you would need to ‘take foolhardy action without talking to your team.’ ‘You can also clear a condition when someone else comforts or supports you or when you defend someone.’ So, keep that in mind. Um, and that’s a serious thing cause that condition of Insecure gives you minus two to defend and minus two to reject what others say. So.
Janine: Mm. 
Austin: Very hard to speak up and- and help people until you clear that. [coughs lightly] So, what are y’all doin’? I think this is like- it’s- The timeline for this game has shifted so much, but I imagine it’s still late summer. [coughs] Um, unless there were classes. I don’t remember there being classes though. I don’t think we talked about there being classes actively. Regardless either it’s after school or it’s after your day jobs- you know, whatever your summer job is, and you are at The Double Tilt in the- in the basement prepping for- to go out and continue to investigate this. Waxwing is out on patrol right now. Y’all tell me- Or no, actually I think Waxwing is out being an adult and being a non-superhero right now. Basically doing- doing her Bruce Wayne equivalent thing. So, she is not uh- available at this moment. What are you all up to? What’s it like to just hang at base? At the base. 
Keith: I’m playing a game. 
Austin: What are you playin’?
Keith: Oooo…. Um…. 
Austin: We have a list. Again, we do have a list of arcade machines there. [light laugh] 
Jack: [laughs] Oh god. 
Keith: Oh! We have a list of what’s in there?
Austin: Yeah. 
[crosstalking] 
Keith: How did we do that?
Austin: I’ll pull- I’ll post it. 
Keith: When did we do that?
Austin: Cause Jack did it for the episode description. 
Keith: Oh, ok. 
Austin: There you go. [laughs] 
Keith: I’ll… 
Austin: Do you want to read these?
[crosstalking] 
Keith: Yeah, I’ll read these. 
Austin: Jack?
Keith: Oh, Jack?
Austin: Er- or yeah. Keith. 
Jack: Oh, no. Keith, please go- Keith, please go ahead. 
Keith: Sure. Oh, these are… Ok. [laughs] 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Keith: [clears throat] Salmon rOH-NO: a caviar game.
Austin: Great.
Keith: Horse chase 5 stack ‘em tall, pile ‘em high, let ‘em loose, our farm in the valley, yesterday’s gunslingers, today!, drink up the oceans…
Austin: [disgusted] Ugh.
Keith: ... Armageddon 4: they’re back, Asteroid- [laughs hard]
Austin: Just one. [laughs] Just one asteroid. 
Keith: -Timber! a lumberjack game, horse chase 3, lighthouse keeper… lighthouse keeper: rivals… oh, and then in parenthesis (competitive). [Austin laughs] Uh, drift ’n’ crash drum, drum, drum, cage of death, you’re the king now, chicken coop!, the end of the world.
Austin: There’s more. There’s more. 
Keith: Oh, there’s more? Sorry. Lighthouse keeper: rivals (cooperative). So, we’ve got competitive and cooperative.
Austin: Both cabinets, yeah. 
Keith: Uh, the reset, um… What the hell is this word?
Art: Calliope. 
Keith: Callio- [cah-lee-oh]... Calliope? [cah-lee-opee]
Art: Calliope. [cah-lye-opee]
Austin: Calliope. [cah-lye-opee]
Keith: Calliope? [cah-lye-opee] What is a calliope?
Art: It’s the- It’s like, circus instrument that like…
Keith: Oh! Yeah. Ok. 
Art: If you think about circus music in your head, that’s that.
Janine: It’s also an ancient Greek muse.
Keith: Ok. 
Janine: Muses.
Austin: There you go.
Keith: So, you got Calliope’s one- original, two and three.
Austin: Right. So, what are you playin’?
Keith: Um… 
Art: Do you think it’s the instrument or the- or the goddess?
Keith: I think the first one… I think each one has a different definition of calliope, and so the first one is the instrument, then the goddess, and then it’s whatever a different version of a calliope is. Anyway, I’m playing ‘drink up the oceans.’
Austin: Ok. [light laugh and resigned] Great. [Keith laughs] Uh, ironically it- the third game is about 22 Kalliope, an asteroid. It’s an Asteroid clone. 
Jack: Ohhh. Oh, it’s an Asteroid clone. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: Is it- So, it’s summer, right? In Bluff City right now. 
Austin: Yeah, I think we’re saying it’s late summer. Is kind of what we are saying. 
Jack: Yeah, so it’s like… it’s- it’s like, hot in the arcade. I think - or underneath the arcade. I think that whatever the ventilation is down here isn’t good. Um, and so I think that like, Paternoster is just like, slumped on a chair. Like, playing with their phone or with like a- like, a games console of some kind. The like, underneath an arcade with all these games, just playing like a Nintendo Switch or something. What year is this? We have flip phones, but… 
Austin: Uh, it’s Bluff City weird. 
Jack: Sure, ok. I’m-
Austin: I’ll tell you what it after. It’s after Fiasco. It’s post-Fiasco. It’s post… it’s post Inspectres. 
[crosstalking] 
Austin: It’s pre… it’s pre...
Jack: Sure, I’m playing just like a Nintendo DS.
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. You’re playing a device that- that we couldn’t get the Nintendo DS. We couldn’t clear that so it’s- it’s like, a prop department got the Nintendo DS, and like stuck an extra handle on it or something.

[crosstalking]
Jack: Right. Yeah. It looks weird as hell. 
Austin: A third screen. 
Austin: There’s a bottom screen. There’s like- you know, there- Instead of being a top screen and a bottom screen, there’s a top screen and a middle screen and a bottom screen.
Janine: [laughs] Hang on. Can it- [laughing] I just- I just had an image in my head of two PS Vitas connected by like, a door hinge. 
Austin: Yeah, perfect. [Jack laughs] 
Janine: And I know- that’s not convincing, but it’s just a really good image. 
Austin: And they’re book-shaped. It’s a book-shaped console. You have to op- you hold it. It’s vertically- it’s tall. [light laugh]  It’s tall instead of-
Janine: There were DS games that made you do that. 
Austin: Totally. And now- now there’s double Vita games that make you do that. [light laugh]
Jack: Lumines Lumines. 
Austin: Exactly. 
Jack: Um, and I’m just holding like, a can of- of soda to my forehead and playing a golf game with one hand or something. 
Austin: Perfect. Uh, what are you doing-
Keith: [interjecting] Is it cause you’re tryin’ to warm up the soda?
Austin: [whispering] Oh my god.
Jack: I’m just… [exhales and laughs; Keith laughs hard for 9 full seconds]
Austin: Uh, Champ and Grouse, what are you two up to?
Art: I was definitely gonna just let that laugh linger as long as it was gonna go. [Austin, Janine, and Keith laugh; Art exhales a small laugh]
Austin: Champ?
Art: I think Champ is like, lying on like, a table just like, throwing a ball in the air and catching it like, on their- on her back. Like… I feel like, that’s just like, an expression of- of passive boredom. Like, ‘I’ve played all these games.’ [Austin laughs] ‘All the times I want to, I’ve been the king now so many times.’ [Austin laughs again] I’m just- I’m just over it. I’m just doing this like, basic… I was gonna call it like, a reflex exercise, but that’s not really what it is, right? No one’s ever like- I’m not saying no one’s ever like, hit themselves in the face with a ball they throw in the air and tried to catch, but like… 
Austin: But I’m not gonna make you roll for it. 
Art: Right. 
Austin: Great. And uh, Grouse. What are you doin’?
Janine: Um… [exhales] I think Grouse is doing like… uh… probably like, advanced placement kind of coursework stuff. 
Austin: [deflated] Ok. Yeah. Perfect.
Janine: [laughing] Doing summer homework or whatever. Like…
Austin: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. You are like,- Well, it is- Maybe you’re about to go off to college. Maybe you’re about to- It’s the end of the summer, you know?
Janine: Mhm. 
Austin: I think that’s- Grouse is maybe the sort of person who has that- that track. Or- or maybe you’re a junior going into your senior year, and so maybe you’re, like you said, prepping- doing like, summer AP courses. So, you’re already getting college credit, even though you’re not gonna actually leave for another year. Um… who normally goes from like, passive mode to ‘Ok, we should do this superhero thing’ mode?
Keith: Me. It’s me. 
Austin: Ok. So, how does that happen in this case? You finish your game?
Keith: [over Austin] I- I lose the game, yeah. 
Austin: How- Ok, I’m not gonna ask you. I was gonna ask you-
Keith: [over Austin] I was gonna say, it’s an arcade game, so you- it’s- It only stops when you lose. 
Austin: Right. Right. And so, that happens. 
Keith: So, I lose the game, and then I notice that none of us are doing anything and… what are we doing here if we’re not doing anything? So, let’s you know- Come on. 
Austin: How do you say that? Do you just say ‘come on’? [light laugh] 
[0:30:00]
Keith: Yeah. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Come on. What are you- what are we- what are we doing here if we’re not gonna be doing anything? Come on. 
Art (as The Champ): Nothing’s happening out there. Nothing’s ever happening out there. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): There’s always some sort of thing happening out there. That’s part of it. 
Jack (as Paternoster): [over Keith] Did we check out… did we check out that Roland place?
[Austin laughs]
Keith (as Mr. Good): Roland. The…
Jack (as Paternoster): The- the Roland- the pushing. The pushing? The pushcarts. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Um, the tire swing lot?
Jack (as Paternoster): No, no, no. No. Who- who was it who… It was you. Found that flier. Like, a coupon, right? For the… When you’d gone down to chase Thresher.
Keith (as Mr. Good): Uh huh. Yeah. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Did you check it out?
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah, I checked that out. 
Jack: Did you? [laughs] 
Austin: Did you- did you check that out?
Keith: Yeah, I checked out. Yeah. Yeah. [stronger] Yeah. 
[crosstalking]
Austin: How did you check it out?
Art: What was it like?
Keith: I just-
Austin: Why did this happen offscreen? [light laugh] [Jack laughs] 
Keith: I- I don’t think it did. No, I think it happened onscreen, right?
Austin: No. 
[crosstalking]
Austin: You found that out.
Keith: What- wasn’t it an offer?
Janine: I don’t think that- [light laugh] 
Keith: Wasn’t it offered that we were gonna go back and look at the- after… 
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yea. I think- I think Paternoster-
Jack: Oh. Oh. Yeah. I meant did you-
Austin: -said ‘Did you go like, investigate the pushcart place?’ 
Keith: Ohhhh, no. No. I didn’t do that. [Austin laughs] Um… I have that. I take out my wallet, and I’ve got like- I don’t know like, twelve different clues from different things. [Jack laughs]
Austin: Great.
Keith: [laughs] Just sort of like, folded up into the- There’s no money. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Is there a-
Keith: I’ve got another wallet for that. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Is there a number on there?
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah, it’s the eight- eighth most recent thing, so… 
Jack (as Paternoster): No- no, I mean [exhales a laugh] is there a phone number on the… 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Oh, a phone number. Um… yeah. There’s a phone number.
Jack: Austin?
Austin: Yeah. There’s- Yeah, of course, the answer is yes. Um… it’s like, 555- um… it’s five-
Jack: It’s almost like, he has a different fake one. 
Austin: Oh yeah, but it- I don’t want to give a real one. 
Jack: Oh, that- [laughs] 
Keith: Five… it’s 555-ROLL.
Jack: [still laughing] That’s good.
Art: Yeah, we can’t give a real number. [laughs] 
Keith: Five- It’s five-
Austin: Yeah. It’s probably a 609 number. That is- That- or that’s the area code in Atlantic City. Uh, maybe this is 690 maybe. I don’t know. Uh, and like, yeah it’s- it’s actually 555-ROYC. R-O-Y-C, but there’s not any- The name definitely has an ‘E,’ but you can’t fit one. 
Keith: ROYC. [roh-eek]
Austin: Maybe… maybe he got 55-ROYCE so he could fit his whole name. [Jack laughs] Uh-
Art: That’s a real number now. [laughs]
Austin: I know! Fuck! 
Art: He didn’t get that. 
Jack: Get 555-ROYK.
Keith: There’s a local carpet-
Austin: [laughing] He had to use a ‘K!” He couldn’t get the-
Keith: I’m- I’m pretty sure it’s local. There’s car- Do you guys have Empire Carpets?
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Ok. Um… I’m pretty-
Austin: [over Keith] I think it’s- it’s not a New York thing?
Keith: I- Well, we have them in Massachusetts, at least. 
Austin: Mm. 
Keith: Or at least we have commercials for it.
Art: We have Empire flooring and window treatments, but not carpets 
Austin: I think that’s all the same. It’s all the same. 
[singing the Empire jingle together]
Art: 800-588-
Austin: 88-
Art: 2300~
Austin: 2300~
Austin and Art: EMPIRE~
Keith: Yeah, so- Same. 
Austin: Today. 
Keith: So, that’s a lo- I… Don’t they give a longer phone number than is possible for that?
Austin: 800-588-2300? No. 
Keith: Oh, I thought that EMPIRE was part of the number that you had to dial. [Austin and Janine laugh] I don’t know. It’s a very old memory of mine from watching TV-
Art: My-
Keith: -as, you know, a ten year old, but…
Art: I… Can I have a- can I have a brief aside on this?
Austin and Keith: Yeah. 
Art: Do you know the- the Cellino and Barnes injury attorney commercials?
Austin: They have- They’re part of Bluff City uh… conversational history, yeah. 
Art: Did anyone- Did I also get to the offshoot?
Austin: No. 
Art: That Barnes has his own firm now?
Austin: Ooo. They break up?
Art: And their old- their old- The Cellino and Barnes jingle is like, [singing] ‘Injury Attorneys 800-888-8888.’
Austin: Yeah.
Art: And the Barnes group just has, ‘800- eight million.’
Austin: Wow. 
Art: They just have eight and all zeroes. [Keith laughs]
Austin: Power move. 
Art: [singing to the same tune] ‘That’s the Barnes group injury attorneys. Eight hundred- eight million.’ [Austin, Jack, and Keith laugh hard] 
Janine: That’s not good. 
Keith: [wheezing high-pitched laughter] That’s so good. 
Austin: That’s great. What a fuckin’ terrible superhero. [laughs] 
Keith: It’s so… it’s-
Janine: [over Keith] I’m gonna have to like, count when I dial. I don’t want that. I just want to be able to sing.
Art: No, just hit zero until you stop- until it starts ringing. [Austin, Keith, and Janine laugh]
Jack: Eight hundred, eight million.
Keith: Eight hundred eight million is a- It’s also a funny thing to say cause it’s not a number. 
Austin: No. 
Keith: Eight hundred- eight million. 
Austin: [sighs out] God. 
Keith: You don’t get that. 
Jack: Oh, it’s so good. 
Austin: Well, it’s not even eight hundred- eight million!
[crosstalking]
Austin: Oh, I guess it is. Cause it’s one eight hundred. Eight million.
Art: No, it’s not eight hundred. It’s eight million. 
Austin: Yeah, ok. I gotcha. 
Keith: So, why not… eight- eight… I guess it- Yeah, I guess it’d be real- more confusing if you said like, eight billion- eight million, which is the real number. 
Austin: Which is the actual number it is? Yeah. That would be the worst. Alright. Uh… 
Jack (as Paternoster): Ok, do we want to like… I know we kind of screwed the last one up, as far as Waxwing was concerned. What with the whole-
Keith (as Mr. Good): [over Paternoster] But we got the money.
Jack (as Paternoster): -we’d like to take some of the- Yeah, but I feel like we made her mad. Do we want to phone ahead?
Keith (as Mr. Good): You mean like, ask permission to check out a clue?
Jack (as Paternoster): No, no, no. Be like, ‘Hey, we’re- we’re stopping by.’ You know, we need a cover of some kind. We can’t just show up and re- redeem the coupon, right? We gotta like, snoop around. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): [over Paternoster] That’s how coupons work. No, you just described a coupon. 
Janine (as Grouse): Why don’t we just pretend we’re tourists and-?
Keith (as Mr. Good): [over Grouse] Do they have coupons in London?
Jack (as Paternoster): [pauses] Yes. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah, so you go-
Jack (as Paternoster): Yeah. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): -use it. You don't have to say, ‘can I use this?’
Jack (as Paternoster): Ok. Tourists?
Art (as The Champ): You know, you kind of sound like a tourist. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): You sound like a tourist. Yeah. And they’re gonna pick up on that right away. 
Janine (as Grouse): That’s really true. Mhm. 
Jack (as Paternoster): It’s not that bad, is it?
Keith (as Mr. Good): It’s- I mean, it’s not… ba-
Art (as The Champ): It’s not bad. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I mean it’s…
Janine (as Grouse): It’s not a bad thing. You’re just not… You just… speak-
Keith (as Mr. Good): It’s just like [disgusted] ‘eck, a tourist,’ you know? [Janine and Art laugh] Like, someone would look at you and notice you, and if they didn’t already know who you were, they’d go, ‘ugh, tourist,’ you know?
Art (as The Champ): You look like someone where someone would be like, ‘hey you want to play three card monte.’
Jack (as Paternoster): I do like that game. [Austin and Keith laugh] Should we- should we- So, we just go? Should we just go? It’s gotta be on the boardwalk. Is it just… near here?
Keith (as Mr. Good): No, we should call ahead. [long pause; someone sighs] I’m kidding. We should go. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Ok. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I’m sorry. I was-
Austin: [interjecting] So, you go. 
Keith: Yeah, we should go. 
Austin: Ok. Next planel. It’s like- ‘No, we should call ahead.’ And everyone just looks at you, and you grin, and then the next panel after that is like, the establishing shot of the- the Royce’s Rollercarts place. It is off the boardwalk because they don’t just… Boardwalk rent is high, and so they are in fact like, three blocks off the boardwalk. It’s like, a sweaty warehouse that’s been converted into dispatch and like, storage- I mean it’s a warehouse, so it’s already a storage place. But like, there is a shitty dispatch booth set up. You know, there are people coming in and out with roller carts. There’s definitely someone like, working on the wheels of these roller- these pushcarts. 
Um, and uh, there is a… a very tall man in a suit behind the- one of the… the- behind- in the dispatch booth, basically. He is a tall Italian man who has like, a very thin mustache and a very- like, very thin features in general. And is balding. And has on- like, it’s like a grey suit that is- It must be a fuckin’ million degrees in there, but he’s trying to be presentable, I guess. And he sees you all come in, and he looks very confused as you walk into this weird warehouse dispatch center. 
Keith: I- I hold everyone back for a sec, and I whisper, 
Keith (as Mr. Good): [whispering] How is this a clue?
Jack (as Paternoster): [whispering] Oh. I’ve heard about this. It’s- it’s… I think- I think that we hand in this coupon, right? And it’s like, a special coupon, and then they… give us someone who’s pushing it who will communicate some information to us. 
Art (as The Champ): [whispering]This is a conversation we one hundred percent-
Keith (as Mr. Good): [whispering] Yes. Yes. 
Art (as The Champ): [whispering] -should have had before being in this building. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): [whispering] No, yeah. You’re right. Yeah, we should have had it- we should have had it at the arcade. I’m sorry. [laughs] I feel like I pushed us to go, and then I realized that I don’t know how the coupon is a clue. [Austin laughs quietly] I- That sounded-
Janine (as Grouse): Oh- [sighs] 
Keith (as Mr. Good): -right to me though. Do we- do you think we’re gonna get like, a mole cart driver? Pusher?
Janine (as Grouse): No. Why would that happen?
Keith (as Mr. Good): I don’t know, but why would some-
Janine (as Grouse): Do you- do you carry a coupon where if I punched you… [Austin and Art laugh] it would lead me to somewhere [laughing] who knows you and would tell me about you?
Keith (as Mr. Good): [laughing] Well, we took off a really dangerous villain. They don’t get punched that often. I- I guess I’m- I guess I’m not a hundred percent-
Austin (as Dispatch Man): [interjecting] Excuse me. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah?
Austin (as Dispatch Man): Excuse me, are-
Keith (as Mr. Good): Hi. 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): Can I- can I help the four of you?
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah, we were about to be ready to be helped. Yes. Thank you. 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): [pauses] I’ll… Can I help you? [Art laughs] 
Keith (as Mr. Good): No, we are about to be ready to be helped, please. Thank you. 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): Please inform me once you are more than ready. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yes, absolutely will do that, yeah. [whispers] Ok. Any other ideas for how this is a clue? [light laugh] 
Art (as The Champ): Yeah, just try to use it. What’s the- I mean… It’s gotta be a start. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): [over The Champ] But if we just use it, then we don’t have it. Then we lost the clue.
Art (as The Champ): [light laugh] You didn’t like-
Keith (as Mr. Good): They could just take it from us. What if there’s like invisible ink on it? [pause] I’m just saying. 
Janine (as Grouse): What?!
Keith (as Mr. Good): I don’t think there is, but I’m just saying I don’t know how to do this. 
Art (as The Champ): This is definitely a conversation we should have had back at the arcade. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Totally agree. I’m so sorry. [Janine/Grouse sighs] 
Art (as The Champ): Which is-
Jack (as Paternoster): Excuse me. 
Art (as The Champ): -you were the one who made us leave the arcade. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I know. I said I’m sorry. I really am sorry. But it just occurred to me that I- we- None of know what we’re actually doing here. 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): Yes, Miss.
Jack (as Paternoster): Uh, hello.
Austin: This is to you, Hilda. Yeah. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Uh, we’ve uh- we’ve got one of- we’ve got one of these. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah, what do you say to that?
Austin (as Dispatch Man): Ohhh, wonderful. A coupon. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Is there anything else that you have to say about it?
Art (as The Champ): [groans] Oh my god. 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): Thank you? You didn't need to bring it here to redeem it. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Oh, could’ve- [laughs hard] 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): Oh. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Sorry, hold on. Can we have done that on the phone?
Austin (as Dispatch Man): The phone? N- no. You simply… [breath deeply in and out] Is this one of those prankers?
Keith (as Mr. Good): No, sorry. 
Jack (as Paternoster): No, not at all. No. 
Keith: I look at- I look-
Austin (as Dispatch Man): Am I am on the internet?
Keith (as Mr. Good): No, sorry. 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): [over Mr. Good] Have you put me on the internet?
Keith (as Mr. Good): We’re- we’re all… We’re all tourists. 
Austin: [pauses] And he like, scans the four of you. [light laugh] 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): You don’t look like tourists. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): [whispering] Paternos- say something.
Jack (as Paternoster): [inhales] It’s sunstroke.
Art (as The Champ): [whispering] Use your posh accent. 
Jack (as Paternoster): It’s definitely- it’s definitely sunstroke. Uh, he’s been- he’s been on the beach all day. Uh, it’s- it’s… uh, you know, getting quite a tan. 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): Oh, I see. We will take your-
Keith (as Mr. Good): [over the Dispatch] Tourist! Tourist!
Austin (as Dispatch Man): -coupon if need a pushcart. You would need two. There are four of you, and even though we have a three person cart, there are four of you which means you will st-
Keith (as Mr. Good): [interjecting] Do you have carts where two of us can push and two of us are inside?
Austin (as Dispatch Man): None of you push. 
Art (as The Champ): No, they push the cart. Yeah. 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): We push the carts. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I’m- But I’m-
Austin (as Dispatch Man): [overlapped] I’m sorry.
Keith (as Mr. Good): No, you’re right. [laughs] 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): You seem very confused. The sunstroke must truly have you. The- uh- Tyler. Come… put this- put this man in a cart.
Austin: And the man whose like, working on one of the… the uh, pushcart like, wheels like, tightens up a bolt and then hops up and rolls a cart over to you. And he goes, 
Austin (as Tyler): Yeah, go ahead. Get in. 
Austin: Like, a thirty-two year old dude. White dude with uh, shorter length brown hair. Real greasy. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Thanks. 
Austin: And you just sit in this cart. 
Janine (as Grouse): Do you have like, a planned route?
Austin (as Tyler): Yeah, the boardwalk. What? [Jack laughs] We go up and down the boardwalk. Tell me where you want to go. And I’ll push you there. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Can you take us up and down the boardwalk?
Austin (as Tyler): [pauses] Ye- yes. But you have to tell me where you’re going.
Keith (as Mr. Good): Back h... [Janine/Grouse sighs] Wait, do we know where we’re going after this? See. [laughs] This is a mess. 
Janine (as Grouse): Ok. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Sunstroke. 
Art (as The Champ): Don’t say it’s a mess! [Art, Austin, and Janine laugh] 
Janine (as Grouse): Uh, mm. Ok. 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): [voice no different from Tyler] Are your parents nearby? Perhaps I should speak with them. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): [overlapping] We’re tourists. 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): You’re tourist children. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I’m-
Austin (as Dispatch Man): Certainly you have parents near you. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I’m nineteen. 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): [unbelieving] Yes. [Art laughs] 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Not a child. Able to be out and about on my own. [Art still laughing] 
Austin (as Dispatch Man): I didn’t get to run Royce’s Rollercarts by taking lip from a nineteen year old. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Are you Royce?
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): That’s right. Rayburn Royce. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): That’s wild that you own this business. 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): I’m very proud of it. 
Austin: And like, sweating down- sweating through his shirt. He like, straightens out the lapels on his suit. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): You’ve got some guy in there- Wait, hold on. You’re in a suit pushing the-
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): I.. I run the business. I used to push the carts. I bought them one at a time. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Oh! I’m sorry. I thought you were about to push our cart. That’s why I was confused.
Austin (as Tyler): No, that’s me. It’s Tyler over here. It’s me Tyler. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Sorry, I- I thought that your two-
Austin (as Tyler): Hey. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I thought this was the same guy. 
Austin (as Tyler): Two different people. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I- Yeah. I realized that-
Austin (as Tyler): I know. You were- The sunstroke is real bad with this one, boss. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): [laughing] Sorry. This sunstroke is really bad. Yeah. I really didn’t- I hadn’t noticed there’s two different people talking. Sorry. 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): The rest of you goin’ for a ride? What’s goin’ on?
Jack (as Paternoster): Yeah, who’s riding with uh- with Franklin?
Janine (as Grouse): Uh, hey-
Jack (as Paternoster): Who is already in a cart. 
Janine (as Grouse): Oh- Mm. Uh, ok. You- Hilda, Frank, why don’t you two go for- for a nice ride. And-
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): [interjecting] We can get somebody- Alvarez! Alvarez, can you push?
Austin: And he-
Janine (as Grouse): No, see I’m actually- I’m actually local. Like, they’re visiting me. They’re- you know, they’re like, sleep in the basement stuff. I actually wanted to talk to you about somethin’ else. Uh, I don’t need to go on the tour. I- You know- [overlapped] I know the boardwalk. It’s-
Austin (as Tyler): [over Grouse; in same voice as Royce] You talk to me about somethin’ else?
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah. 
Austin (as Tyler): [slightly lowering voice] You talk to me- Ok. Well, ok. We can talk over here. What do you wanna talk?
[0:45:00]
Janine (as Grouse): Uh, you- I’m lookin’ for like, a summer job kind of thing. 
Austin (as Tyler): Oh, you’re tryin’ to push. 
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah. 
Austin (as Tyler): You should talk to Royce. [laughs] He’s the one who hires you. [Art laughs] 
Janine (as Grouse): Wait, is that not…
Austin (as Tyler): How old are you?
Janine (as Grouse): Sorry I didn’t know I was not talking to Royce just then. [Keith laughs] 
[crosstalking while laughing]
Austin: This guy who's down here is definitely not Royce.
Janine: Right. Ok. I forgot. 
Austin: He’s up here. 
Keith: Sorry. We’re all-
Janine: I forgot there’s Jersey accent guy, and then there’s vampire accent guy. 
Austin: [laughing more] There’s vampire accent guy. 
Janine: I forgot. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I think we were all in the sun, and it’s- it’s really hot. 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): It‘s really hit you. It’s really hit this whole group. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): We had these cool- we have the cool sodas and they were heating right up on our foreheads. [Keith, Austin, and Art laugh; Janine sighs] 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): That’ll- that’ll get right to you. 
Art (as The Champ): Yeah, it’s a whole situation. Anyway, like- like we were sayin’’ we’re looking for some pushin’ jobs. 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): [laughing] This conversation has changed in tenor entirely. How old are each of you?
Keith (as Mr. Good): I’m nineteen, and then… old enough to be out and about. 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): There is probably-
Janine (as Grouse): You don’t- you don’t live here, Frank. You should- You’re a tourist. You should just enjoy your pushcart ride. You can’t work in the- Cause you don’t live here. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Yes, can we go up to uh… to where the old scuba shop was?
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): Yeah, of course. Of course. 
Art (as The Champ): Too soon. 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): I think that scuba shop is still open. It’s just a different owner.
Jack (as Paternoster): Oh!
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): I’m pretty sure. I’m pretty sure that’s how that shook out. I read it in the paper.
Jack (as Paternoster): Was that recently?
Keith (as Mr. Good): No, it’s a snorkeling shop now. 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): I’m pretty sure we- there was an establishment of facts here. [Austin and Jack laugh] 
Austin: [referring to another Bluff City episode] There will be a- This boxer...
[crosstalking]
Art (as The Champ): This pushcart shop owner is very invested in-
Keith (as Mr. Good): Sorry. I’m sorry. I’m a tourist. It’s not my place. I don’t know really what’s goin’ on. 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): [laughing; half out of character] Yeah, in the canon in history of Bluff City. I’m something of an amateur historian. So, you know. I like to keep- keep track of things.
Jack (as Paternoster): That’s- that’s amazing. 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): Yeah, I could tell you some history. You come on uh… 
Austin: Somewhere around now Alvarez does come out. She’s a twenty-something um… Latina woman who is um- [tongue clicks] has like, blue hair. Bright blue hair. LIke, dyed blue hair, and she’s like, 
Austin (as Alvarez): Do you need another pusher or not? I’m on my break. 
Art (as The Champ): Nah, that’s a misunderstanding. We’re fine. 
Austin (as Alvarez): [sighs] Alright. 
Austin: And she walks away. Um, so wait. So, who’s Tyler pushing? Tyl- Uh… uh, Frank and…
Jack: And then me.
Austin: And you- and Hilda? Ok. So, Tyler takes the two of you away. Pushes you out the door across streets. Like, this is not where people board these normally. They just get on one that’s on the boardwalk [catches breath] -Excuse me- that’s on the boardwalk. So…
Art: [jokingly] Well, we have a coupon. 
Austin: You- I- [Keith laughs] Well, you could have just given it to the per- 
Austin (as Tyler): You could have just given it to me on the boardwalk. I would have taken the coupon; knocked it off the- the price. 
Art (as The Champ): It doesn’t say that on the coupon. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah. [laughs] Listen, we originally were gonna- [indecipherable speaking while laughing]
Keith: [laughing] Sorry guys. [Janine sighs loudly] 
Keith (as Mr. Good): We originally were gonna call to use the coupon, so I think getting to the office, I think, was a big first step. 
Austin (as Tyler): I gotcha. Just hop in. We’re gonna go. 
Austin: And he takes you two away. Um, Elena and uh, and Chanti… I think you get applications that- that Royce produces. 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): Simply fill out your information. I need your date of birth. I need addresses. Um, I need uh, references, of course. 
Janine (as Grouse): Do you have any like, current employees that we could talk to just about like, you know, the- the you know, the culture? I like being educated about a work environment. 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): The culture… of…
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah. 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): Royce’s Rollcarts.
Janine (as Grouse): Well, you can’t own a business without being proud of your culture, can you Royce?
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): I’m very proud of it. That is why I say if you’re rollin’, it’s gotta be Royce. But of course… Alvarez!
Austin: And the same woman comes back [Art laughs] and is like, 
Austin (as Alvarez): Yeah?
Austin: And he says, um, 
Austin (as Rayburn Royce): These two have some questions about the company culture. Certainly you could answer them for them. 
Austin: And she’s like, 
Austin (as Alvarez): The company culture. Yeah, I can answer them. [pauses] Come with me. 
Austin: And then like, she leads you to like, the break room which is a coffee vending machine, a soda vending machine, a candy vending machine, and then a… like, a jar- not a jar; a bowl that just has saltwater taffy in it. Not loose; it’s all wrapped. It’s wrapped saltwater taffy. 
Janine: i was gonna say that’s- [laughs] 
Austin: Not loose saltwater taffy. And then like, a refrigerator. Um… 
Austin (as Alvarez): [deep exhale] So you kids lookin’ for a job? Is that what this is?
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah. Um… I was wondering like, [sighs] you know… how’s the- how’s the employee turnover around here?
Austin (as Alvarez): Oh, it’s bad. What? Yeah, it’s bad. 
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah?
Austin (as Alvarez): People come-
Janine (as Grouse): Lose a lot of people?
Austin (as Alvarez): -come and leave all the time. 
Janine (as Grouse): Mm. 
Austin (as Alvarez): Uh, summer jobs. 
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah. 
Austin (as Alvarez): You know uh… people come in. They do the work for a couple months. Kids like you who have school kick back up. You go back to school. Or a lot of Polish people come. Lot of Polish people come. I don’t know what it is. I don’t- I think it’s like, a deal with Poland. Bluff City-Poland connection. I don’t know, but-
Art (as The Champ): How’s the… how’s the pay?
Austin (as Alvarez): Bad. Bad. It’s built for tips. No one tips. [overlapping] Legally-
[crosstalking] 
Art (as The Champ): [over Alvarez] Are there any like, opportunities for-
Austin (as Alvarez): -it can be cheap. 
Art (as The Champ): -for like, extra… Are there any like, extra… money opportunities?
Austin (as Alvarez): Extra money opportunities. 
Art (as The Champ): No, like, any of y’all got some side hustles?
Austin (as Alvarez): You know, uh, it’s Bluff City. Everybody got a side hustle. What are you- what are you guys lookin’ for?
Art (as The Champ): Well, I don’t know. What do you got?
Austin: [sighs] It sounds like you are… trying to find out information here. 
Art: I am. 
Austin: Is this… [thinking noise] tchoo-tchoo-tchoo- This is Pierce the Mask, it sounds like. [reading] ‘When you pierce the mask to-’
Art: Great, I think I’m bad at that. 
Austin: ‘-to see the person beneath-’ Uh, yeah. Roll plus Mundane. 
Art: I think you mean roll minus Mundane. 
Austin: [laughs] I- I sure do. [Keith laughs hard] 
Art: Did that work?
Austin: [impressed] It did. You got a hit. Nice work.
Janine: Nice!
Austin: You got a nine. [reading] ‘On a seven to nine, ask one: What are you really planning? What do you want me to do? What do you intend to do? How could I get your character to blank? How can I gain influence over you?’
Art: How could I get your character to tell me what the crimes going on here are? [laughs] 
Austin: I- Like, that’s probably too tight, right? [Art laughs] Uh, well, I guess that’s… Um, ok. [overlapped] Actually, there’s an answer. There’s an answer.
Art: [over Austin] I think that your character could tell me about some cool crimes. 
Austin: What she says- She just straight up asks you- is like, 
Austin (as Alvarez): Well, what do you need the money for? You guys are young. 
Art (as The Champ): We probably-
Austin: [over Art] So, you have to convince her why you need side hustles. Why can’t- She’s like, 
Austin (as Alvarez): Uh, you know, people who have side hustles, they have ‘em for a reason. You know. The… shitty landlords. Sick family. Uh, you know. All sorts of stuff. But not just cause you want like, an extra Double Vita game this year. That you could just push the cart for. 
Art (as The Champ): Um, yeah. You know, I don’t like to talk about it much, but we all got sick family members. 
Austin: Um, I’m trying to think if there’s- Is there just a straight up ‘I’m lying to a person move’ in this game?
Art: I mean, we’re all dying, Melissa.
Austin: I know. [Austin and Janine laugh] [Austin groans ‘uh’] I’m just- I’m looking at moves real quick cause it’s been a minute. Um… you don’t have a special move for this specifically, right? You don’t have any sort of like-
Art: No, I’m- I’m like, really bad at this thing I’m doing. I’m- 
Austin: Great. 
Art: I really should just shut up. 
Austin: No, I love it. I love it. 
Art: Unless you want to say this is directly engaging a threat. 
Austin: This is not that. Um… I think this is Provoke Someone, maybe. Yeah, this is Provoke Someone. [reading] ‘When you Provoke Someone susceptible to your words, say what you’re trying to get them to do,’ which we’ve established. You’re trying to get them to give you information on these side hustle- on these crimes. And uh, roll plus Superior. ‘For NPCs on a ten plus, they rise to the bait and do what you want. On a seven to nine, they can instead choose: they stumble- you take plus one forward against them, they err- you gain a critical opportunity, they overreact- you gain influence on them.’ So, give me a Superior. 
Art: Alright. And my Sup-
Austin: [over Art] Also, I think there is straight up, you can still help and stuff. So, Chanti, if you want to help on this, this is totally a thing I think you can still do. Maybe not. Maybe that’s only when you entle- enter battle. That might only be when you enter battle. 
Janine: I don’t know. 
Austin: Yeah. I think the only other way to do it would maybe be to…
Janine: I mean, I would like to help. But I…
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you-
Janine: I don’t know… [overlapped] how. 
Austin: You don’t know how- how it works. I think you would have to influence- Use influence on her, but I don’t think that- I don’t think you have that influence, so I don’t think it matters. Um, so yeah. Go ahead and give me the roll. That is another- that is a success. That’s an eight. Um, so you can choo- or sorry, they instead choose one. [reading] ‘They stumble- you take plus one forward against them, they err- you gain a critical opportunity, they overreact- you gain influence on them.’ So, here’s what I’m gonna say. *They say, 
Austin (as Alvarez): [heavy sigh and whispered] Fuck. Alright. I… I don’t know what it is. I like you, kid. You seem- good head on your shoulders. Um, fwoo… I heard there’s a thing going on. [exhales] Something that could use a little um… not muscle. I mean you’re strong. I can tell you’re strong, but like, a little extra help, and you wouldn’t be dangerous. But it would be… there would be an opportunity to make a couple bucks. 
Art (as The Champ): Great. Great. 
Austin (as Alvarez): Um… [sighs] 
Austin: She says... she says,
Austin (as Alvarez): Ok, I’m gonna give you an address.
Austin: No, no. What she says is like, 
Austin (as Alvarez): Do you have a phone number? I can text you about it. Just a- I’m not gonna say what it is, but um you know… 
Art (as The Champ): Yeah, I got this flip phone. 
Austin (as Alvarez): Oh no, you really do need the money. [Art and Janine breath a laugh] 
Art (as The Champ): I mean, it makes calls. It’s- it’s fine. 
Austin (as Alvarez): Um, let me see. 
Austin: And she takes your phone and like, puts h- puts a number in it, and hands it back to you. And she says,
Austin (as Alvarez): Expect an-
Austin: Or I guess actually what she- she texts herself, right? So that she gets your number. 
Art: Right, yeah. 
Austin: And then she takes out a phone. She takes out a different pho- She also has a burner. It is not a flip phone, but it is not a smart phone either. It is like a- it is like a- an old Nokia non-flip phone. [laughs] Um, and she adds your number to the thing. And then she says like, 
Austin (as Alvarez): Ok, I’ll text you. Just be patient…. It’s a thing I heard about from a friend or whatever, so… I don’t know all the details, but I will let you know. 
Austin: And she like, walks you out. Unless there’s other questions here, but the- the thing that is- The thing that you’re gonna get here is when you- when she’s like, walking you past her locker, inside you can just straight up see um, that she has a little box- er a little bag of those shark masks that her thugs were wearing. That her- that her gangs- That her- No her thugs. Her henchmen. Her lackeys uh, were wearing. 
Keith: Toadies. 
Austin: In like- [clears throat] basically like, a plastic convenience store bag. 
Art: Mm. 
Austin: She like, quickly closes that locker as she walks past. But that is her- her err. She errs, and you gain a critical opportunity. 
Art: Great. So, that coupon is just cause that’s from her work? [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah, she just dropped it. She just dropped it. This is her. Tyler is pushing you two down the boardwalk. [light laugh] And you’re just havin’ a nice day. It’s just nice out. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Oh, this breeze is really helping me clear up. I don’t know what was goin’ on with me before. 
Austin (as Tyler): Breeze is good for sunstroke. I read that on the internet. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah. it’s the- it’s the pressure, I think, on the face. It does something. 
Austin (as Tyler): The face pressure, yeah. Definitely. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah. Mhm. 
Austin (as Tyler): Here you are. You’re at the scuba shop. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Thanks. 
Austin (as Tyler): What are you- Y’all goin’ scuba- 
Austin: Y’all- where did that come in? [laughs] Uh- that’s a different character. [high-pitched voice; jokingly] Y’all goin’ scuba-in’? Goin’ scuba divin’?
Keith: I’m just- Yeah. [laughs] I’m scared.
Austin: [silly voice] It’s me, Tyler. [Keith and Jack laugh] 
Jack: [laughing] Is the verb for...
Austin: [over Jack; still in silly voice] My accent changes when I get to the scuba shop. 
Jack: Is the verb for scuba diving, scuba-ing?
Austin: Scuba- It’s diving, I think. I think it’s diving. [Jack laughs] You go-
Art: [over Austin] I think it’s scubing. [skah-bing]
Austin: It’s- [Austin and Janine laugh] 
Keith: You scuba-
Austin: Scubing? [skoo-bing]
Keith: Scuba is a- is an acronym, so it can’t be- You can’t change it. So, I think it’s scuba-ing. 
Austin: Really?
Keith: Yeah. 
Jack: Yeah, it stands for Sea lions. Crabs… [Austin and Jack stutter]
Austin: Underwater. 
Jack: Underwater. 
Austin: Barricudas. 
Jack: Bubbles.
Keith: Se-
Jack: Bubbles and Barricudas. And then um… 
Keith: Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus. 
Austin: Or scubba. [skah-bah]
Jack: A-ctopus.  [Janine laughs]
Keith: Or scubba. [skah-bah]
Austin: Scubba. [skah-bah]
Janine: [laughing] Stop saying s-
Austin (as Tyler): Here you are. You’re at the scubba [skah-bah] place. [Keith and Janine laugh] Be careful. I… I don’t want to- I heard the guy who used to own this place died underwater. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): No, a different guy owns it now. He’s alive. 
Austin (as Tyler): Ok. Has he-
Keith (as Mr. Good): You told me that. 
Austin (as Tyler): I know, but I’m sayin’ the guy who used to own it died underwater. I wouldn’t trust these submarines. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Oh, the submarines? No, I’m uh… 
Austin (as Tyler): You could- the scuba’s probably fine, but the- the scuba’s [skah-bahs] probably totally on the- above board, [Art laughs] but the submarines, I’d be careful of. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I’m scared of the ocean. I just collect different breathing apparatuses. 
Austin (as Tyler): That makes you sound like a villain in a David Lynch movie. [Art laughs hard] So, uh...
Jack (as Paternoster): It’s the sunstroke. 
Austin (as Tyler): That’s a little…
Jack (as Paternoster): It’s the sunstroke. 
Austin (as Tyler): I’m a little uh… 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Hey man, I’m not- I’m no villain. 
Austin (as Tyler): Confused and concerned. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I’m no villain. 
Austin (as Tyler): Ok. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Definitely not. 
Austin (as Tyler): I’m gonna let you go now. I’m gonna go back the other way and see if I can get a coup- a dri- another client. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): If-
Austin (as Tyler): That’s what Royce says we should call them. Clients. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Clients?
Austin (as Tyler): I say passengers. He says clients. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): How ‘bout guests?
Austin (as Tyler): Guest is not bad. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Run that by him. 
Austin (as Tyler): Do you have any other questions or should I be going? This has been a strange interact- Give me money. [Art laughs] 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I thought we had a coupon.
Jack (as Paternoster): [overlapped] Yeah, uh-
Keith (as Mr. Good): We had the coupon. 
Austin (as Tyler): Yeah, two dollars off. It’s- it’s still eight dollars. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Ok, here’s...
Jack (as Paternoster): I think we just like… pay him and tip him 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Here’s uh… I- Well, here’s the thing, hold- We’re gonna pay you. Hold on really quick. One second. [quietly] Do- We didn’t get anything from this guy.
Jack (as Paternoster): [tired] Yeah, he pushed us out here.
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah, and now- and now what? We’ve gotta try to do somethin’.
Jack (as Paternoster): … Well, we’re- [heavy sigh] I think this was a-
Keith (as Mr. Good): Ok, hold on. [laughing] Hold on. I got it. 
Jack (as Paternoster): [to Tyler] Thank you- [resigned] Oh. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Here- I- I’m gonna bribe him. 
Jack (as Paternoster): No! Woah! Woah, woah, woah. [Art laughs] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Austin (as Tyler): [over Paternoster] Yeah? I’m listenin’. [clears throat] I could be uh… I could be- I’m a flexible individual. Morally speaking. Not particularly the other way.
Keith (as Mr. Good): Ok. I- Well, then I have an either/or for you. 
Jack (as Paternoster): I don’t know if this is a-
Keith (as Mr. Good): I get you a few extra bucks-
Jack (as Paternoster): I don’t-
Keith (as Mr. Good): You gotta either tell me um, about some villain shit or-
Austin (as Tyler): What?
Keith (as Mr. Good): -you gotta put both your arms behind your back. [Jack and Keith laugh] 
Austin (as Tyler): [laughs] Oh.
Keith (as Mr. Good): [amused] Whichever kind of flexible you wanna be is fine. 
[1:00:00]
Austin (as Tyler): If I put both my arms behind my back, you’ll give me extra money?
Keith (as Mr. Good): I mean, but you’ve gotta do it in a weird like, double jointed way. [Jack laughs] You gotta do it from… like-
Austin (as Tyler): [disgusted] Ugh. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah, I’m doing-
Jack (as Paternoster): Um…  let’s-
Keith (as Mr. Good): I’m doing it right now, you can- if you guys can see me. 
Austin (as Tyler): Or what’s my or? [Jack laughs]
Keith (as Mr. Good): Or… you know about any cool villain shit?
Austin (as Tyler):  No, that’s the ‘either’. I need the ‘or’.
Keith (as Mr. Good): The ‘or’ is the- is the like, double-jointed flexible thing. 
Austin (as Tyler): No, that’s ‘either’. So, it’s ‘either’ I-
Keith (as Mr. Good): Either-
Austin (as Tyler): -tell you about villains and put my arms behind my back, or somethin’ else. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): No, no, no, no. That was the ‘either/or’. 
Austin (as Tyler): Mm. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): It’s either you know about some cool villain shit that’s goin’ down that we can get in on, or you can do like, some weird double jointed shit for me. 
Austin (as Tyler): What’s to stop me… 
Austin: And he stops himself. 
Austin (as Tyler): Yeah, I know about some villain… shit. 
Austin: He does not know anything about villain shit. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Look, it’s ok. Thank you for- thank you for you know, doing this. 
Austin (as Tyler): They’re gonna rob a bank. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Who?
Jack (as Paternoster): Yep. I’m sure- [laughing] I’m sure they are. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Who? When?
Jack (as Paternoster): Franklin. No. Franklin. 
Austin (as Tyler): Ball Gang Unit. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Franklin? 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Ball- [laughing] Ball Gang Bank? [Art laughs] 
Austin (as Tyler): No, it’s-
Keith (as Mr. Good): [Keith shouts while laughing] They’re gonna rob Ball Gang Bank?! [Art groans laughter]
Austin (as Tyler): [catching breath laughing] Mr. Ball. I- [groans] Oh-
Jack (as Paternoster): Look, you’re doing great. 
Austin (as Tyler): He’s gonna rob a bank.
Jack (as Paternoster): Thank you so much. 
Janine: Is he like, looking sideways at a dog that’s playing with a ball? 
Austin: [laughing]  Yeah, absolutely. [Keith laughs hard] 
Janine: [laughing] Is that what happened here?
Austin: Yeah. 
Austin (as Tyler): They’re gonna rob the scuba shop after that. For sure. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Uh huh. Thank so much. Uh-
Keith (as Mr. Good): You’re ly- He’s lying, right?
Jack (as Paternoster): No… [resigned] Yes, Franklin. He’s lying. 
Austin (as Tyler): Ok, I tell you some- Ok, villain shit. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Villain shit. Real- for real. 
Austin (as Tyler): Ok, wait. How much you gonna bribe me?
Keith (as Mr. Good): Here’s… forty dollars. 
Austin (as Tyler): Why do you want to know? I thought you were tourists. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): No, remember cause you were like- remember how you nailed a hundred percent that I was a villain? I told you about my mask thing, and you were like, ‘that sounds like some villain shit.’ Well, here’s the thing. I’m a villain, and I’m lookin’ to get in on it. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Oh my god. 
Austin (as Tyler): [whispering[ You’re a...
Jack: Paternoster just like, gets out of the pushcart and is just like, pacing around the pushcart. Like, doesn’t want to leave Franklin behind, but does not want to be near him.
Austin (as Tyler): This- Is this still the sunstroke or are you walkin’ around with a- with an honest to god villain type?
Jack (as Paternoster): Ya know, it’s a little of both. 
Austin (as Tyler): Isn’t he really- Alright. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Have I been acting like a guy that’s not a villain today?
Austin (as Tyler): [resigned] Alright, I have to check my sources. Yeah, you could be a villain. [pauses] Alright, I don’t want you to hurt me. Is this what-
Keith (as Mr. Good): I’m not gonna hurt you.
Austin (as Tyler): Ok. 
Keith (as Mr. Good):  I’m not that kind of villain. 
Austin (as Tyler): But you were gonna bribe. A villain-
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yes.
Austin (as Tyler): Villain’s bribe people. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah, that’s a crime.
Austin (as Tyler): What type of villain are you? Are you like a… [clicks tongue]
Keith (as Mr. Good): I’m a money… criminal. [Jack laughs]
Austin (as Tyler): A money criminal… like- like a- like the sort who robs banks. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Very that- rest-
Austin (as Tyler): Like Mr. Ball. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah, lots of different kind of crimes. 
Austin (as Tyler): Ok.
Keith (as Mr. Good): Like, maybe I would rob a bank. Yeah. 
Jack: It is wild that this guy doesn’t know who Paternoster is. But I am not upset about that fact. [laughs] 
Austin: Oh, right. You’re famous. Give me a roll- Do you have a thing about that? Do you have a thing about like, ‘does this person know me?’
Jack: Nope. I don’t. Uh, my thing says, ‘Bluff City knows me,’ but-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: But this guy hasn’t seemed to… 
Austin: He would know who you are. 
Jack: Does he listen to WBRK?
Keith: No, he’s a historian. He’s got-
Austin: Definitely listens to the Break. 
Keith: He’s in- he’s in the books. 
Austin: He is- Mm, he is in the- He’s on the internet. He’s on reddit, is what he is. Um… here’s what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna roll a die. Evens, he recognizes you now, now that you’re like, out of the car. 
Keith: That’s fine. 
Austin: Cause wait, your wings are hidden, right?
Jack: Uh… 
Austin: Or not?
[crosstalking]
Jack: I could say that they are, but I would be lying.
Austin: This whole sequence would make no sense [light laugh] if your wings has been out.
Keith: You just walk around with those huge wings? You got enormous wings, walkin’ around like that. 
Jack: I think they’re folded. I think they’re folded up. We’ve talked about how Paternoster will- would like, go to class with her wings out. 
Austin: Right. Right. [louder] Right. True. 
Jack: But I think- I think knowing that we were gonna be tourists-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -I’m- I’m wearing something that- that like, they’re folded away.
Janine: [over Jack] Can I suggest something? That it’s like maybe-
Austin: Please. 
Janine: Like, one of those sort of um… squared kind of backpack satchels, but she cut the back open-
Austin: Oh that’s good. 
Jack: Oh yeahhhh.
Janine: -and like, tucks the little wingys in there. 
Austin: That’s good. 
Jack: Oh, that’s great. Yeah. 
Janine: So, she looks cool, but is also less conspicuous. 
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: We- we also- we weren’t going to be tourists. You are a tourist. 
Austin: I didn’t say what I was rolling. I’m gonna roll a 1d6. Evens, he knows you. Odds, he doesn’t. 
Jack: [sucks teeth] Well, ssshhhit.
Austin: That’s a- I rolled two sixes in a row, which is unbelievable. Um, 
Austin (as Tyler): Wait a second. You’re not a villain at all. You’re the uh… The Wing. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I’ve-
Jack (as Paternoster): I never said I was a villain. 
Austin (as Tyler): You’re uh- Fuck, how do you pronounce it? Pah… You’re Patterson! Patt Patterson. [laughs] 
Keith (as Mr. Good): [laughing] Patt- Patt- Yeah, it’s Patt Patterson. 
Austin (as Tyler): Patter- uh… Pitter-patter.
Jack (as Paternoster): It’s Paternoster. It’s- it’s Paternoster. 
Austin (as Tyler): Paternoster! The- With the wings. You got the win- Oh, no. Did he take your wings?!
Jack (as Paternoster): He’s not a villain, and he didn’t take my wings. Um, uh-
Keith (as Mr. Good): This sucks. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Look. Uh, look. 
[crosstalking]
Austin (as Tyler): Alright, I’ll give you-
Jack (as Paternoster): There’s been some strange… 
Austin (as Tyler): Ok, go- You tell me. 
Jack (as Paternoster): There’s been some strange goings on.
Austin (as Tyler): Uh huh. 
Jack (as Paternoster): You know? Strange- strange things going on. And- and… and we thought we’d just keep our ear to the boardwalk, you know?
Austin (as Tyler): Yeah. 
Jack (as Paternoster): So, we came down here hoping we could-
[crosstalking]
Austin (as Tyler): [over Paternoster] Talk to me cause I walk this boardwalk everyday. I know what’s really going on. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): You literally breath this boardwalk, Tyler. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Everyday you’re pushing people. You can hear- You can-
Austin (as Tyler): Don’t go under there.
Jack (as Paternoster): What?
Austin (as Tyler) and Keith (as Mr. Good): [together] Don’t go under the boardwalk. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I heard that- I heard that elsewhere, too. 
Austin (as Tyler): It’s scary. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): She really is a tourist, by the way. 
Austin (as Tyler): Yeah, I can hear it in the voice. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah. 
Austin (as Tyler): -and whatnot. I’m tryin’ to think of other good tips for you. [lip pop] Um… Mike-O’s best pizza in town, if you're a tourist. Go to Mike-O’s.
Jack (as Paternoster): Ok. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): What if you’re not a tourist?
Austin (as Tyler): Miko’s. [mee-koh-s]
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah. 
Jack (as Paternoster): I’ve been here for a while. 
Austin (as Tyler): Um, other tips. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): You didn’t even know how to use a coupon. 
Austin (as Tyler): [thinking noise] Br-br-bah-br-br-br- Uh, The House Always Wins is one you learn from being here. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Do you know- 
Austin (as Tyler): Uhhh...
Keith (as Mr. Good): But original question. Back to-
Austin (as Tyler): Yeah. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Do you know about some villain shit?
Austin (as Tyler): Not like uh- contemporary. Like, not like, ‘oh, what’s happening tomorrow with the villains.’ I don’t keep up. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): [over Tyler] Yeah, you don’t know what they’re up to?
Austin (as Tyler): But I will say-
Keith (as Mr. Good): Do you know someone who does?
Austin (as Tyler): No. Um… Like, on the internet, maybe. Wiseguy79, he’s like big on the- the superhero thing. Uh… JennyBabe- JennyBabe loves the Waxwing/Goldfinch situation. That whole thing. That’s her whole thing. Uh, she might keep up. Um, you know, just people on the- on the user group. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Mhm. 
Austin (as Tyler): Um… but here’s what I’ll tell you. Stay away from those coastguard motherfuckers. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Hm. 
Austin (as Tyler): Mm?
Keith (as Mr. Good): But we’re… So, all the places…
Austin: [interjecting] He grabs his like, tank top and like, pulls it down a little bit, as if he’s like, nodding with the top of his tank top. As if like, ‘hm?’
Keith (as Mr. Good): Got it. Yes. Coastguard. 
Austin (as Tyler): Just I wouldn’t trust ‘em. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Oh. Ok. I- I still- I- you know, here’s- I don’t know. [overlapped] Twenty-five bucks?
Austin (as Tyler): [over Mr. Good] I’m just saying every major catastrophe, they show up. You remember when the ferry sunk?
Keith (as Mr. Good): There they were. 
Austin (as Tyler): There they were. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Ok. [overlapped] Thank you. 
Austin (as Tyler): Do you remember the fi- the firework-
[crosstalking]
Keith (as Mr. Good): Here’s the money. Here. In your hand is the money. 
Austin (as Tyler): -barge blew up and the fireworks- Coastguard. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): We have to go-
Austin (as Tyler): Right like that. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): -check out those masks that I was interested in buying. Thank you. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Those were also- Thank you so much. 
Austin (as Tyler): Which masks? Wait, which masks are you looking into?
Jack (as Paternoster): No, it was part of a- [overlapped] 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I was- I was collecting scuba mas- uh, the different kinds of respirators. 
Austin (as Tyler): Oh, right. The apparatuses. The villain- Right. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah. 
Austin (as Tyler): The villain thing. Ok. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah, that was real. I do need to go and look at those. 
Austin (as Tyler): Alright. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Bye. 
Austin (as Tyler): Well, have fun. Good luck. Oh, I-! Hold up! Wait. 
Austin: And he gives you a coupon for two dollars off your next ride. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Oh. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Oh, thanks. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Thank you. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): We- Should we call for this?
Jack (as Paternoster): No, it’s- Oh. [sighs, exasperated] 
Austin (as Tyler): You just- [Austin stops; Keith laughs]
Austin: Next panel. Next page. [Keith cackles in the background] Um- [Janine sighs] so, what’s up with- with Champ and- and uh, Grouse? Where are you hangin’ out waiting for this text?
Art: [light laugh] Um…
Janine: Probably like-
Art: Yeah, go ahead. 
Janine: I feel like we’re probably like, sitting on the boardwalk like, eating garbage food and like, maybe texting Paternoster to be like, 
Janine (as Grouse): [text] Where are you guys at? How’d it go?
Austin: Probably a good thing to be asking. Yeah, the two of you get a text while you’re in the scuba shop. 
[corsa talking] 
Janine: Maybe, ice cream, and we’re eating it.
Jack: Uh, I send a text back that just says, 
Austin: Oh, is there a group chat? Do you have emoji?
Jack: [excited] Oh yeah. There’s absolutely-
Austin: [over Jack] Oh no, you can’t have emoji-
Jack: [deflated] Oh.
Austin: -cause you have flip phones. [laughs] 
[crossalkting] 
Jack: So, we just- [inaudible]
Austin: Oh, you can. It’s just not free.
Keith: It costs regular. It’s emoticons.
Janine: Do we have to use the flip phones ourselves?
Austin: I guess you don’t have to. I do like the idea of like, grey and black monochrome emoji though. 
Jack: Oh yeah. Totally. Um… so I just send a text back saying like, 
Jack (as Paternoster): [text] [Nice man. Useless information.] [Jack and Austin laugh]
Janine: Um, I text back, 
Janine (as Grouse): [text] We got something. Have to wait for more. We’re at Donovan’s or whatever the fuck the ice cream place is.
Jack: Uh...
Austin: There’s an ice cream place? Was there an ice cream place?
Janine: I don’t know. I just-
Austin: Oh. You’re saying Donovan’s. Yeah. 
Janine: I just pulled a name out and didn’t want to presume that- If there was a- if there was an in fiction ice cream place-
Austin: No. No. 
Janine: -I didn’t want to-
Austin: I thought you were saying like, ‘oh, you remember the whatever.’ No, that’s good. Donovan Dipper. Donovan’s Dippers. The ice cream place.
Janine: Eww. [laughs] What? [Art laughs] 
Austin: Uh huh. Write this down.
Keith: [laughing] What is he dipping?
Austin: The ice cream. 
Janine: [laughing] Done by Mr. Ball?
[crosstalking]
Keith: I’ll take- I’ll have one Hurdy Gurdy Man extra-
Austin: Donovan Ball. Donovan-
Keith: -extra dipped. 
Austin: Yeah. It’s dipped ice cream. Donovan’s Dippers.
Janine: [quietly] I hate it .
Austin: And then I also need to write down-
Janine: Oh my god. 
Austin: [laughs] -the Ball Gang. [Janine laughs] Other important facts., uh…the the Ball Gang is fake. He was thinking Donovan Ball from Donovan’s Dippers, and it just- it really confused him. Uh, there- [typing] oh, Mike-O’s Best Tourist Pizza. And then Miko’s. Like the Japanese name, Miko [mee-koh]. Best Local Pizza. Miko’s. Alright. 
Art: It’s a Japanese pizza joint?
Austin: Yeah, it’s good. 
Art: [intrigued] Huh. Sure. 
Austin: So, I think- I mean, it’s gonna be a few hours until- until you get a text from- from Alvarez- from Alandra Alvarez. I think- I think it’s just- She puts her name in as ‘A’ probably into your- into your phone. Um… so yeah. I just need to know what’s- what’s poppin’ off in the background while this is happening? Or while waiting. Is it more throwing the ball and catching it? Is it getting ice cream and chatting about other stuff? Yeah, actually, I want that scene. I want- I want the ice cream scene between the Champ and- and Grouse. Between Chanit and- and- Elena. 
Keith: Can we all pick a different Donovan to name our ice cream after?
Austin: Sure. 
Keith: All of our Donovan songs that we know. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: Who?
Keith: Donovan!
Austin: This is what I thought was gonna happen. Uh… but before the two of you get there, Chanti and- and- um, and Elena are just there waiting. Can I get like, a sequence of what hanging out for these two characters looks like? Because Elena, you don’t have Chanti as either your love or your rival, which puts her in an interesting kind of neutral position on that. 
Art: Yeah. 
Janine: Mm. 
Art: I mean most people on earth are neither our loves or our rivals. 
Austin: True, but like, you’re also not in your superhero teams together. 
Art: Sure. Some people have bigger superhero teams. 
Janine: Uh, so I think Chanti just like… um, I keep pronouncing my own character’s name differently. I’m sorry. Uh, I think she just like, asks Elena like- probably something like, super noncommittal at first. Just like, licking her ice cream and is like,
Janine (as Grouse): How’s training going?
Art (as The Champ): Oh, you know, real good. Real good. It’s hard to- it’s hard to get a match right now because of all the stuff that’s goin’ on, but um… You know, I’m just tryin’ to stay- stay sharp. How’s you?
Janine (as Grouse): Uh… good. You know. [pauses] Tryin’ to figure out what I want to major in and stuff like that. [overlapped] When I get there anyway. 
Art (as The Champ): Sure. Sure. Whatcha think’ about?’
Janine (as Grouse): I don’t know. I… My mom really thinks I should do like, biology, zoology. Like, she really wants me to get into- [sighs] She wants me to get into ornithology. Just like birds. And like, I get it, but… it’s so on the nose. And I don’t… 
Art (as The Champ): Yeah, no. I hear that. 
Janine (as Grouse): I don’t know that I want it to be my thing. You know?
Art (as The Champ): I think that’s a really bad uh… labor market. I don’t think you really wanna be doin’ that. I think it’s a hard job. 
Janine (as Grouse): I mean also like… [sighs] How- What is- What does that look like? What does that look like down the line, right? This is what I keep telling her. I’m like, what does it look like when the- when I like, am working with a bird or something, and the bird’s like, ‘Hey, I don’t like this kind of food, actually’? Am I gonna like-
Art (as The Champ): Yeah. 
Janine (as Grouse): -tell my boss that the bird told me they don’t like this kind of food that- that the book says they like? And that I know that cause I talked to it- or?
Art (as The Champ): No, don’t say that. 
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah. [laughs] 
Art (as The Champ): It just puts you in a weird position in your life where like, the best possible job you can get is some rich person who has like, a private aviary and wants like a- a bird keeper. And like-
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah. 
Art (as The Champ): That’s just a fancy maid. 
Janine (as Grouse): Like a bird maid. [sighs] 
Art (as The Champ): Like a bird maid. You should- you should try and do something where you’re not just someone’s maid. 
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah. 
Art (as The Champ): I- I don’t know. That’s just me.
Janine (as Grouse): I kinda want get into like, nursing or something, but I don’t know. 
Art (as The Champ): Sure. Sure. 
Janine (as Grouse): It’s a growth industry. Everyone’s dyin’.
Art (as The Champ): [light laugh] Always fun hangin’ out with you. 
Keith: I was thinking… I know I wasn’t there, but I was thinking bird psychic. 
Austin: That’s what she is now. 
Janine: That’s not a- Yeah, but that’s- that’s not a job. You can’t really monetize that-
[crosstalking]
Keith: But you do it as like- you can run it as a-
Janine: -without being a huge… scammer. 
Keith: No? You don’t think there’s people that are like, ‘tell me what my bird thinks.’
Austin: We can- So, I think actually, in the comic book, cause again we have to think about this- it’s- it’s so fun to think about this as a comic and not as a movie- which is what we normally do. I think it is just the like- it is a full page of- a horizontal half page panels or like, half- half-horizontal length panels. You know what I mean? There’s like ten panels, and it’s- There’s a clock on the wall in the background. 
There’s like a- it’s starts with just like, milkshakes or like, each of you gets like, one scoop sundae or whatever. And then each one it’s just like, a various- it’s one other line from this conversation about the future. And like, halfway through, Paternoster and uh- and Mr. Good filter in, and are like, there. And just like, more and more bowls of ice cream and glasses of water and coffee. And you’re just waiting for this fucking call to- to happen. Um… and yeah, so we do get the line that is just like, [laughing] ‘What about bird psychic?’ from Mr. Good [Keith laughs] that’s just- 
[1:15:00]
And then like, everyone else like, looking at you like, ‘uh.’ Um, and then finally, the last panel in that- in that series is Donovan coming over like, in his apron and being like, 
Austin (as Donovan): Kids, we’re closing.
Austin: And it’s nighttime out, and he sees you outside. And then we get the like, the door closing, and then we get whatever your ringtone is as the number uh, from- from Ala- er uh… [thinking noises] bah-bah-bah-bah-bh-bah- I have to get my notes back up… um, Alandra is her first name. And keep forgetting her last name. 
Janine: Alvarez.
Austin: Alvarez. Alvarez begins to- to text you. And it’s just an address. It is- [sighs] eleven twenty-three Ocean Drive, and that is over in… Dune City [typing] which is a- in a neighborhood- a neighboring city. I can show you like, on our map from a different game where it is. So… y’all are basically like… somewhere in here now. Right? Like, middle of this big island. There’s another sister island to the south, basically, that is like a family- it’s like a family oriented resort in comparison. It’s much smaller than Bluff City. It’s not that far away. It’s like, a twenty- thirty minute drive away. And that’s like, all amusement piers. It’s- it’s- amusement piers and like, arcades and little gift shops. Lots of beach- like, families at beaches. It’s a dry city. There’s not- there’s no alcohol out on the city. You can’t buy-
[crosstalking]
Keith: [over Austin] Lot of shitty laser tag.
Austin: It’s allowed. You can bring it in.
Austin: But lots of la- yeah, a hundred percent laser tag. A hundred-
Keith: Like thirty different all of- just cardboard walls. Like-
Austin: Yes. It’s like- it’s like, a carnival all summer, right? It’s like, carnival games out on the street- er out of on the boardwalk. It’s residential also. Lots of- lots of residential there. And those people often work in the casinos in Bluff City. Or work locally in, you know, the things that workin’- people work at in the suburbs, but it is not a like um… it’s not a casino town in the same way. And so that is where you get the address. It is just in some building there. 
Art (as The Champ): What are we gonna do?
Janine (as Grouse): We’re gonna-
Art (as The Champ): We can’t like, show up and help. 
Janine (as Grouse): I mean look, most of us- well… She saw some of us. She didn’t see all of us.
Austin: That is true. [light laugh]
Keith (as Mr. Good): And only Tyler knows that we’re heroes. 
Janine (as Grouse): Who’s- Oh, right. He’s the guy. 
Art (as The Champ): And I mean- 
Janine (as Grouse): Sorry, wait. [louder] He knows… Excuse me? [Austin laughs]
Keith (as Mr. Good): It’s fine. 
Jack (as Paternoster): He recognized me.
Keith (as Mr. Good): He didn’t- Yeah, he didn’t know, and it was um… had nothing to do with any other kind of plan that we were tryin’ to have. Um… but he didn’t seem to know anything about um… anything. So… that’s not true. 
Janine (as Grouse): Well, that’s-
Keith (as Mr. Good): He knew about the coast guard, and he knew not to go under the boardwalk. And he knew about the two best-
Janine (as Grouse): What did he know about the coast- the coast guard?
Keith (as Mr. Good): Yeah, there’s-
Jack (as Paternoster): It was a whole thing. He’s just like, they show up after every disaster.
Keith (as Mr. Good): No, they’re-
Jack (as Paternoster): I think he was joking. 
Janine (as Grouse): I don’t know. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): He… He was not joking. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Well, they do show up after every disaster, but that’s cause that’s their job, Franklin. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Alright. 
Art (as The Champ): But did he know that?
Keith (as Mr. Good): [laughs] He knew- he knew it was their job.
Austin: He knew.
Keith (as Mr. Good): But he recognized that it’s a little convenient. 
Jack (as Paternoster): [laughs] So, that’s about where we are, Grouse. I mean- [Janine/Grouse sighs heavily] I can’t show my face there. If- if it gets caught on a camera or something and if word gets out that Paternoster was… I don’t know in- wrapped up in some kind of crime thing. 
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah. You should start doing like, really severe contouring so people don’t recognize you as easily. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Do you just want like, a mask? Even like a- like a latex- like, a other face?
Jack (as Paternoster): It’s kind-
Art (as The Champ): Calling it an ‘other face’ is so…
Austin: [laughs] Again. 
Jack: Oh god, yeah. 
Austin: Like a- a David Lynch villain. [laughs]
Jack: [laughing] Another face. 
[crosstalking] 
Janine: That’s the brand that like, has latex masks in Bluff- Bluff City- 
Austin: Do you want another face?
Art: Would you like, another face?
Janine: -is Other Face. 
Austin: [laughs] Yeah, Another Face. Other Face. Yeah. [groans] 
Jack (as Paternoster): I- I’m happy to go and kind of like, stake it out and keep an eye on- on the rest of you. Um…
Keith (as Mr. Good): That works. 
Jack (as Paternoster):But I- I don’t know… that I should-
Keith (as Mr. Good): But if you showed up with a mask, then everyone would be like, ‘wow, you’re so… so fitting in as a villain.’ [overlapped] With a mask.
Art (as The Champ): Nah, we should have someone watching our back, and that’s a great idea. That’s- you know. 
Jack (as Paternoster): I can stay on the rooftops. I’ll be fine. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Ok. 
Austin: Ok. So, do y’all go?
Keith: Yeah, I’m goin’?
Austin: Do you drive the… the amphibious car there?
Janine: We- Frank and Elena have mask-ass masks, right? Or like, what-
Austin: No, Franklin doesn’t. Franklin’s face is just out there also, right? I think we’ve established Mr. Good is just… Mr. Good. It’s just your face.
[crosstalking] 
Keith: Yeah. I- I think I might be seen in like, a Robin style mask.
Janine: Also, is it ok if…
Austin: Ok, like a domino mask. Yeah. Ok.
Keith: But I- I’m not- I’m not totally sold on that. I think that is- Yeah, it’s either- It’s one or the other. It’s either the like, weakest possibly mask or no mask. So. 
Janine (as Grouse): I’m also worried it won’t be cool with her if we just show up with a plus one. 
Jack (as Paternoster): You could say that you like, recruited- You- you know, it was like, ‘uh, we...’ I don’t know. I could see an argument for being like… I don’t know. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): Do you want me on lookout?
Art (as The Champ): No, that does kind of sound like how you get shot in the face.
Keith (as Mr. Good): Do you guys want a look- a second lookout?
Janine (as Grouse): Then again, she did also walk out… of the shop… when she thought we needed a ride. And didn’t… say anything. 
Austin: She didn’t- she didn’t clock who Paternoster was in that moment. That scene wasn’t long enough for her to be like, ‘ah-ha, Paternoster’s here.’
Janine: Hm. 
Jack: Yeah, and I mean I think I’m probably wearing sunglasses as well. It was just like, after a prolonged rollcart ride that the guy was like, ‘Hang on a second.’
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: Jack, wasn’t your con- er sorry, wasn’t Hilda’s concern primarily what if someone sees her do a crime, and then it fucks up her reputation the other way, too, right? Like-
Jack: Yeah, or sees her associated with- Like, if someone’s like, ‘wow, that’s some real sneaky shit that Paternoster is involved with…’
Janine: Mm. Yeah. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Um… But like, that’s why I’m happy to sort of- to- to you know, be watching through binoculars or something. Or like, swoop in if we go into danger. 
Janine (as Grouse): Mhm. 
Jack (as Paternoster): I just don’t want- I don’t want my photo on the front of the tabloids next to the words ‘did a crime.’ [Austin laughs] 
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah. Yeah. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): It sounds like being a celebrity hero… is like… makes it harder to be a hero. 
Austin: That strangely- [Jack laughs] Do- do you have um… Does Mr. Good have… He- de does. You do have influence over Paternoster. Um, that sounds like you’re shifting a… an influence- 
Keith: It does. 
Austin: -to me. 
Keith: It does sound that way.
Austin: [reading] ‘When someone with influence over you tells you who you are or how the world works,’ which definitely just happened, which was ‘if you have- if you are famous, it is harder to be a hero’ ‘accept what they say or reject their influence. If you accept what they say, the GM will adjust your labels accordingly. If you want to keep your labels as they are, you must reject the influence.’ 
Jack: Uh, I think- I think… Paternoster just sort of like, sighs and pushes her hair back and is like, 
Jack (as Paternoster): Yeah. Yeah, it kinda does. You know, I wanna be on the ground with you lot, but um… Yeah, I got- I got Amanda to think of and… you know, I wouldn’t be able to pay a salary if- And she’d be mad mostly. She’d just be mad at me. Um-
Keith: [whispering] Who’s Amanada?
Austin: I’m gonna lower your Superior and increase your Mundane.
Jack: Uh, Amanda is my PR agent.
Keith: Oh… right. [louder] Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why lower Savior… er Superior-
[crosstalking]
Austin: Superior. 
Jack: Oh, lowered Superior. 
Keith: -and increased Mundane?
Austin: Wait a second… That just- Yeah, that’ll work.
Keith: Instead of the other way around?
Austin: What? Because you’ve made the case that-
Keith: To be less famous?
Austin: -to be less famous is better. 
Keith: Oh, I thought maybe I was pointing out-
Austin: [quietly] What is this? [inaudible]
Keith: -that being famous sucks, and it’s made- and then making it harder. 
Austin: No, wait. Your Superior was one and your Mundane was zero? Is that right? No, your Mundane was one also. Right? Yes. Your Mundane was one. Your Superior was one. Cause it was all ones except for Danger, which was minus one. 
Jack: Yeah, which was minus one. 
Austin: So, then Superior goes down to zero, and then-
Jack: Huh. 
Austin: -Mundane goes up to- up to three.
Keith: And I remove my influence over her?
Austin: No. [light laugh] 
Keith: I keep it. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Got it. 
Austin: Up to two. Sorry, up to two. Yeah, you don’t spend that influence unle- The only way you lose that influ- Well, you can spend that influence, and the way to do that is to take advantage of your influence over someone. [Jack laughs] Which then makes you-
Jack: Wow. Mean.
Austin: -surrender your- the influence you have over them.
Keith: Got it. 
Austin: But to give them like, a minus two or to like, take an additional plus one on a move that targets them. 
Keith: Got it. Yep. Got it. 
Austin: Um, ok. Uh, here’s the other question. Maybe we should retroactively do this. Was part of that- I missed that conversation in the- in the ice cream shop. Would you say Elena, that you were comforting or supporting um, Chanti with that conversation?
Art: I would say that, yeah. 
Austin: Ok. Then give me a… a plus Mundane. Because that is Comfort or Support, which could let her- Ok, on a seven- [reading] ‘on a hit, they hear you. They mark potential, clear a condition, or shift labels if they open up to you.’ 
Art: Oh, can we- can we shift back so we have all this?
Austin: Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. My bad. Uh, so yeah. I think- So yeah, you can shift labels, clear a condition, or mark potential, Chanti. 
Janine: I’m gonna clear Insecure, I think. 
Austin: Ok. Look at that. Good timing on that. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: I’m glad I remembered that that’s a thing that happens. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: The thing I like about this is like, both of those sequences were just things you did. You weren’t like, ‘I’m going to use the Comfort or Support Someone move’ or ‘I’m going to tell you how the world works.’ You just do because that’s just what characters do all the time. Anyway, so are you going to head into this place? Two- two of you go in, and two of you are on watch, basically?
Art: Yeah, I think that’s the proper…
Austin: Cool. Um, so the two of you going in are Chanti and- and Elena. And the two of you staying out are Hilda and Frank- Franklin, right?
Art: Yes. 
Jack: Yep. 
Austin: Hilda and Franklin, where are setting up? Ok, so I should describe the place. You drive onto this- onto this- into this city. It’s getting to be nighttime now, but there’s still a few people out on the boardwalk. I think like, as you’re driving up is when like, you see… you know, it’s like, eleven PM, and you see one of the Ferris Wheels closes down- or like, shuts off, and the lights go out. The other one is still open. One of the- one of the amusement piers stays open until midnight. The other one stays open until eleven. And uh, you can see that there is a… [click tongue] the address that you were given is like, a three story office park building. Not an office park buildi- like, a three story like, commercial building. Like a- like, law offices and stuff. And there is a fourth floor in construction as we speak, and the- you… the people who are setting up shop- I guess where are you setting up shop to- to do the watch?
Jack: [long pause and inhale] I-
Keith: Oh, have I- Am I definitely doing the watch? That’s fine, yeah. 
[crosstalking]
Austin: Um- I don’t know if you are or if you’re not. 
Keith: Yeah, I’ll do- I’ll do the watch. Yeah. Let’s get two and two.
Austin: Let’s- let’s ask Paternoster who has wings. Where are you setting up at least to- to do your watch?
Jack: Um, is this is sort of place there would- where there would be some kind of cool… like, sign? Like, some- either a neon sign or some sign that’s in a weird shape or like, some…?
Austin: This is much more like, billboard town than cool sign- Like, Bluff City has cool- has cool neon signs. This place has-
Jack: But this isn’t the place for it. Oh, then it’s-
Austin: [over Jack] -local billboards for- for local like, restaurants. Ya know? Or...
Jack: It’s definitely a billboard.
Austin: Ok. 
Jack: Like- like sitting on- with legs dangling over the- the thing of a billboard. 
Austin: Ok. 
Jack: And the billboard is for a television show. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Jack: I don’t know if it’s consistent with the television show that we have made, in terms of time-wise. I don’t know when our televisions shows… exist.
Austin: Yeah, I don’t remember when- when that- 
Jack: But I-
Austin: We didn’t really describe when it existed in Bluff City, so it doesn’t matter. 
Jack: I think it’s a- it’s one of those like- like, a Netflix show or something, and so the poster is just like, a woman with a finger to her lips being like, ‘shh.’ Like, a huge head of a woman.
Austin: [over Jack] Yeah, I love that. I love that. 
Jack: And- and next to it with uh, their legs dangling over the side, Franklin and Hilda. 
Austin: Great. Ok, so and you can- So, you can see from your position that there are people moving around the unfinished fourth floor. You know, it’s- it’s a bunch of like, clear tarps and plastic wrap on- and plywood walls that are half built. And open face girders and- and stuff like that. And you can see there are people moving around inside of there. Around a small um, not a- actually not a small- Do you remember when Microsoft made those surface tables-
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: -a few years ago?
Keith: The Original Surfaces.
Austin: Yeah, the Original Surfaces, which are these big, big touch screen tables. 
Jack: Oh, I’d forgotten about those.
Austin: There’s one of those in the middle that- that is like, low- You watch it be lowered into place by a crane and released. And then… you see someone turn it on, and someone is like, drawing stuff on it. And there’s a group of probably twelve people here. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): That’s gotta be the crime computer. 
Austin: It’s the- It is. You got it in one. [light laugh] Uh… the people who are going inside, you get to the front door. And there is a person fac- There’s like, a glass door with uh… you can like, see into it, and you know, it says like, you know, ‘Dr. Schmidt on floor one.’ And then it says, you know, ‘Electric Insurance on floor two’ and whatever on floor three. And there’s a person inside with their back to the- to the glass door.  And you can’t see their face, but the door is locked, and they are looking down the hallway. What do you do? [long pause] And this is- Again, this is to Chanti and Elena. 
Janine: Were are- Was that text just like, an address basically?
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: It was the address to this building. Yeah. 
Janine: I was wondering if there were any other like, instructions.
Austin: No other instructions. No. 
[1:30:00]
Art (as The Champ): We should say- we should say ‘What’s up?’, right?
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah. They’re probably expecting us if we got that text. 
Art (as The Champ): Hey, uh- uh what’s goin’ on?
Austin: And this person turns around and reveals they’re wearing a shark mask, and they point to where their ear would be and like, cause there’s the door that’s closed and locked. And they go, like shrug… 
[1:30:00]
Art: Point to the ear.
Austin: They can kind of hear you. They go, 
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): Who are you? Who-
Art (as The Champ): Oh.
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): [muffled] Who are you?
Art (as The Champ): Uh, we’re new!
Janine (as Grouse): Show ‘em the phone.
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): Prove it! [Keith laughs] New for what, I mean. What are you new for?
Art (as The Champ): I mean proving I’m new. [Keith laughs] That’s easy. You don’t know me. I’m new. [Janine laughs]
Keith: Yeah, rock solid. 
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): That adds up.
Art (as The Champ): We got a text!
Art: I hold the phone up. I don’t actually open the text. 
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): Show- show me the text. 
Art (as The Champ): Oh my-
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): Lot of people get texts!
Art (as The Champ): Oh my god. 
Art: I like open the text, and like-
Keith (as Other Shark Masked Person): [muffled] Show the thing!
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): Why do you have such an old phone? [laughs]
Art (as The Champ): I need it- We need the job. 
Keith (as Other Masked Person): You know them?
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): [laughing] No, I don’t know who these new people are. 
Keith (as Other Masked Person): I guess if I don’t know you, you must be new.
Art (as The Champ): Do you know us?
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): Probably new.
Art (as The Champ): We’re new.
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): We’re m- What is that? Is that a flipper?
Art (as The Champ): The phone?
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): Yeah, like a retro flipper?
Janine (as Grouse): Uh, mm…
Keith:  Is it-
Art (as The Champ): Yeah, it’s a flipper. It’s a fish phone. 
Keith: [laughing] It’s- They’re shark themed, so it’s flipper. 
Janine (as Grouse): We can’t call it a flipper. Don’t ca…. 
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): It’s flipper, yeah. We should-
Keith (as Other Masked Person): We should get flippers. 
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): We should ask for flipper-
Keith (as Other Masked Person): We’re actually really into the shark theme. 
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): We should Thresher is we can get flipper phones. 
Janine (as Grouse): She- Mm…. 
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): It’d be easier to hear you if you came inside. Can you show us the phone and the text?
Art: I- I like, press it against the glass. 
Janine: Can we just go in? Is this door locked?
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): It’s such an old phone!
Austin: No, the door’s not even locked. No.
Janine: Yeah.
Art (as The Champ): What? You- you can’t read?
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): [still muffled]  It’s hard to see-
Janine: I’m gonna open the door. 
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): [regular voice] Hey. It’s hard to see. Come on in. We’re upstairs.
Janine (as Grouse): You shouldn’t call them flippers. That’s like, a dentist- dentistry thing. If you ask- if you ask someone for flippers, they’re gonna think you want like, fake teeth. [overlapped] It’s gonna be a weird conversation. I’m just gonna save you. 
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): [over Grouse] That’s a- Wait, is that a thing?
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah, that’s what like- that’s what like, little child pageant stars get when they lose their teeth so they still have a full, you know, as their transitioning to grown-up teeth. 
Keith (as Other Masked Person): [laughs] Yeah-
/Austin (as Shark Masked Person): Tha’s-
[crosstalking] 
Janine (as Grouse): So, you get like a flipper with the fake teeth in there to make a nice smile. 
Keith (as Other Masked Person): People are gonna think you need a very [laughs hard] small fake tooth. [Keith and Austin laugh hard; Janine laughs] 
Janine (as Grouse): They make them for adults, too. Look. 
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): Ok.
[crosstalking] 
Janine (as Grouse): I’m just saying I don’t want them to-
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): I thought you were gonna say…
Janine (as Grouse): -roll bad and have an awkward conversation later. 
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): I thought you were gonna say that we shouldn’t do it cause of the dolphin. You know we were sharks, but I think this is a more convincing argument. 
Keith (as Other Masked Person): Those are fins. 
Art (as The Champ): Art: Sharks have flippers, right? That’s what their little things are called. 
Janine (as Grouse): You would call them fins. I don’t think they flip. [overlapped]  That’s the difference is-
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): These are fins. We have fins.
Janine (as Grouse): Sharks don’t flip ‘em. 
Art (as The Champ): They don’t have- they- They don’t have side things?
Janine (as Grouse): They do, but they don’t flip.
Keith (as Other Masked Person): Yeah. 
Art (as The Champ): Mm.
[crosstalking]
Janine (as Grouse): You know? They’re not fl- they are not flipping.
Keith (as Other Masked Person): Well, they flip if they- if it falls off and gotta replace it with a new one.
Art (as The Champ): I mean obviously, I don’t-
Keith (as Other Masked Person): A new little one.
Art (as The Champ): Yeah, the shark child pageant are a real gross thing, but we gotta live with them. [Austin and Janine breath laughs]
Austin (as Shark Masked Person): Nice to meet you. It’s so good to meet new faces. Come on upstairs.
Austin: Um, and you’re shown in to a room of again ten to twelve- er not a room- open air. The fourth floor. You take the elevator up to the third floor and then you climb a staircase up to the fourth floor. There is just like, straight up a regular wooden- like, a house door. Like, the front door to a house, but it’s horizontal. It’s on the ceiling on the top of the staircase, and you open it from- like, as if you’re opening a door, and it opens up and it slams down onto the ground. And you walk up and see what Paternoster and Mr. Good saw before, which is a group of twelve people. You tell they’re in shark masks. And a big shark lady, named Thresher who is here. 
Jack: Can we see this through the window?
Austin: There are not- there’s not a window. It’s just open air. It’s just the fourth floor that has not yet finished construction.
Jack: Oh wow. 
Austin: So, yues. 
Jack: So, this is like a real Spiderman video game situation. 
Austin: Yeah, de- a hundred percent a Spiderman video game situation right now. People in shark masks-
Keith: Why did they-?
Austin: -hangin’’ around in an unfinished building? Absolutely. [Jack laughs] 
Janine: And running an extension cord up here to get that- to get that table goin’?
Austin: It’s portable. It’s a portable surface. 
Janine: Oh. Oh.
Austin: They added like, a little car battery in there or something. 
Keith: Still need a crane to move it. 
Janine: Yeah, that’s how it works. 
Austin: That’s-
Janine: Car battery. [laughs] 
Austin: Uh huh. Um, alright. 
Austin (as Thresher): So, [sighs] here- here put on-
Austin: And- and Thresher tosses the two of you- uh, she actually, she says like, 
Austin (as Thresher): Jeremy, give them some masks. [quiet exasperation] Jesus. Kids. Um, the two of you-
Janine (as Grouse): Well, you could have texted us masks, so we did what we could here.
Austin (as Thresher): You could- I didn’t want you to bring your own masks. That would be weird. The two of you… We’ll get- I’ll get to the two of you. Let me show off the uh… the situ- 
Austin: [still in Thresher’s voice] No one. No, no one asks for names, Art, in the chat. No names. We don’t use names.
Art: Alright, it’s good. I didn’t have to come up with a fake name.
Austin (as Thresher):  You’re Bluefin, and you’re Tuna. 
Art (as The Champ): Who's who?
Janine (as Grouse): Wait, is- Ok. It’s fine. 
Austin (as Thresher): You can choose. I’ll let you choose. 
Art (as The Champ): You wanna be Bluefin or Tuna?
Janine (as Grouse): I thought we were gonna be kinds of shark, but I guess we’re not- You know, we’re not the self-coursing fish. Um-
Austin (as Thresher): You’re guppies right now.
Keith: Those are fish, Tuna.
Austin (as Thresher): You move up the ladder. 
Janine (as Grouse): Yeah. 
Art (as The Champ): Tunas are huge.
Janine (as Grouse): I’ll go Bluefin. 
Art (as The Champ): Alright. 
Janine (as Grouse): Was that one?
Austin (as Thresher): Yeah, it was one. 
Art (as The Champ): Yeah, it was Bluefin and Tuna. 
Janine (as Grouse): Ok. 
Austin (as Thresher): Bluefin. Alright. The- We’ll get to you. I want to give you the outline, so right now, tonight, down there-
Austin: And she points and- is what- Can- can Mr. Good and Paternoster hear this? Are you all on like, an active phone call with them or something?
Jack: Yeah, like I think that it’s a very um… Yeah. They’ve gone in wearing some kind of a wire. I feel like that’s a teen sort of infiltration thing to do to be like-
Janine: [interjecting] It should be a phone so you could just say, ‘Oh I butt dialed someone. Whoops!’ instead of like-
[crosstalking]
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Austin: It’s just a flip phone, right?
Janine: -a patented spy device. [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah. Totally. 
Jack: And I think that the sound is bad, but I think we can hear. 
Austin: Totally. And so, she walks you through what’s about to happen. There is a… She points down to the boardwalk, and you can see that there is kind of this old… There’s a pier that has- it’s shorter than the amusement pier, so it doesn’t go out that far into the ocean, and in fact, doesn’t go out into the ocean at all. It just goes out onto the beach, but there is kind of a… a tan kind of Spanish colonial style um, building that’s like a big hall. It’s- it’s called Heritage Hall, and it is like, a place that you can rent out to do events, but like, mostly Dune City uses it to do like, musical- like, corny musical performances, you know? Like the local- the local high school quartet goes in and plays the hits of the seventies on their- their you know, woodwind instruments. And a bunch of baby boomers show up and dance, ya know? It’s definitely where like, they do uh… the photos for if the local football team wins the regionals. They come here and take photos or whatever, right? It’s that sort of place. 
And tonight, it is being- it is being used for something actually a little fancier than that, but still I would say on this side of corny. It is an auction for local art that is being run by the Veranda family. There is a yearly Veranda family art auction, and uh, Thresher explains to you that there is a painting up for auction by some sort of unknown artist that was actually stolen by the Veranda family, and she has a buyer. There’s a buyer for that family- [light laugh] er for that family- for that painting, who she explains,
Austin (as Thresher): -is gonna give us enough money so that none of us have to worry about anything anymore. You get sick family. You got college loans. You got the bill collector knockin’ at your door. This is gonna- this is gonna take care of you, so [sighs] I just need everybody to be all the way on point tonight. Some of you have run missions with me before-
Austin: Not missions- heists. Jobs.
Austin (as Thresher): Some of you have run jobs with me before, and you know how we do this. We move quick. We move loud. It makes people scared. We get what we came for. We get a couple other things that way they don’t know what we came for. And we move on. 
Keith: I have a-
Austin: [in Thresher’s voice] Was that a question- That sounded like Tuna. You got a question.
Keith: No, sorry. I was gonna make a question.
Art: That wasn’t me. 
Keith: No, no. I had a- I had an out of character question. 
Austin:  [in Thresher’s voice] [light laugh] You’re not here.
Keith: Um…
Austin: Yes. Yes. 
Keith: So, this- this is a job stealing from the Veranda family. They also owned the casino?
[crosstalking] 
Austin: Yeah. They own at least- They own the menagerie, for sure.
Keith: But the casino that we stole… or that they threatened to steal from.
Austin: They may own- [long pause] They... No, I don’t know that that was the Veranda family-
Keith: Ok. 
Austin: -uh, that they were stealing from before. 
Keith: Got it. 
Austin: They- I think it was like a general casino collection van. Like, that goes around and collects from all the casinos and makes a big bank- makes the bank deposits. Um… yeah. Oh wait! No, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Keith: Ok. 
Austin: That’s- It was just a general one. It was not a specific one. Um, Veranda family, for people who don’t know, is the- or don’t remember, was the mafia family introduced in the Fiasco game. 
Keith: I th- I thought maybe there was a uh, pattern of Mr. E. Masque having them do jobs against the Veranda family. 
Austin: [sighs] Not exactly. There is a pattern here, but it hasn’t really been clarified yet. 
Austin (as Thresher): Any questions so far? 
Austin: Somebody raises their hand, and from behind the shark mask is like, 
Austin (as Unknown Asker): Do we expect guards? People with weapons?
Austin: And Thresher says, 
Austin (as Thresher): [clicks tongue] Chances are yeah. Couple people. Some pistols. My guess is they won’t be eager to use them. A lot of uh, connected folks here. Both in the family and outside. A lot of local celebrities. There’s a good chance that uh- that uh… things could- if violence happens, they could hurt people who could hurt them back, and so probably keep a lid on it. Especially if we move quick. Show them there’s more of us than them. Other than that, shouldn’t be anything big. Any other questions? [silence] Alright. Bluefin, Tuna, come check this out. Everybody else, check your gear.
Austin: And she brings you over to the um, the big Microsoft Surface and shows you a map of the place and points towards the- There’s like, a side entrance, and she says, 
Austin (as Thresher): Alright. Here’s all I need you two to do. Make some noise over here. Pull a fire alarm, if you want to. Set off some fireworks. We got some stuff. You can take a look around. Tell me what you need. We probably got it. All I need you to do is make some noise before we hit. That way the guards move out of the main hall and come to you. That way less of a chance even that anybody gets hurts. 
Art (as The Champ): Alright, we’re good. 
Austin (as Thresher): Any other questions. I- [sighs] You’re younger than I like to work with, you know? So, um… [click tongue] But I get it. I know what it’s like to have someone who is hurt and who needs help, so… 
Austin: Remember this is like, a big shark lady talking to you right now. [light laugh] 
Art: Sure. 
Austin (as Thresher): And I hear you’re good, so, you know. Alright. Forty-five minutes, folks. Get ready.
Austin: And everyone like, begins to like, check their gear and stuff. And down the boardwalk, you can see that like, there is a sort of rolling in of more people over and over. There- there must have been a first part of this event. It’s a very late night event, which is meant- which is intended to feel weird. Why do you do a late- why do you do an art auction at like, eleven forty-five or midnight on the boardwalk after everyone else has left? That’s weird. And you can kind of see like, the boardwalk is kind of- everyone’s leaving the boardwalk for the night as- but except for the people who are arriving in fancy clothes, all with fancy masks on to go into this art auction. Team- Team Lookout. Lookout Team, what are you two up to?
Jack: Um… I think that when we hear where um… where the auction is gonna take place-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -um… I’m gonna offer Franklin a ride. And if he’s up for it, just sort of take off into the sky following the- I mean I wonder if we get this panel of like, following the- the uh- the Dark Knight style convoy of Thresher’s crew.
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: And then in the sky above them, Paternoster and Franklin-
Austin: Yeah, totally. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): What do you mean give me a ride?
Jack (as Paternoster):  I can like, hold onto shoulders or the back of your shirt uh… cause ya know? And then we can get there much faster. 
Keith (as Mr. Good): I… Where are we going to? Point to where we’re going. 
Jack (as Paternoster): To the- to the auction.
Keith (as Mr. Good): Are you gonna like, land on the roof? 
Jack (as Paternoster): Why I’m gonna- I’m gonna find a space. I’m gonna find a space to land. And then ya know? We can- we can rendezvous. We can make some kind of rendezvous with the others.
Keith (as Mr. Good): I do not need a ride. And I will race you there because I do not believe that you can… you’re faster than me just cause you have wings. I literally don’t believe it. 
Jack: [pauses] Uh, I think Paternoster just laughs and takes off. [Austin laughs] 
Austin: I don’t know that there’s like a move for racing here. 
Jack: There’s not a move for ra- [laughs] 
Keith: There doesn’t have to be a move. 
Jack: -race another player.
Keith: I- I’m-
Austin: No, but you race?
Keith: I’m tryin’ to race whether or not-
Jack: Oh! Yeah, totally. 
Keith: -Paternoster is- is a different- 
Austin: Uh huh. I mean there is- You- you could theoretically both Unleash Your Powers [Keith laughs] but that feels like a waste of that move. Or- or-
Jack: [amused] Not really unleashing, is it?
Austin: Well, if you’re like, trying to go as fast as you can. It’s a thing kids do, right?
Jack: I’m not tryin’ that hard. I’m gonna fly but I’m- [laughs]
Keith: Ok, but then I’m- but I’m trying super hard. 
Austin: Wow, I guess Franklin wins then. 
Jack: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. 
Jack: [amused] Yeah, absolutely. Franklin just gets there first. 
Austin: Yeah. Um, ok. Where do you two set up? This is a little harder because it’s like, much lower buildings. 
Jack: Oh!
Austin: Yeah?
Jack: I might be able to just talk my way in through the front door. 
Austin: You might. You are famous. 
Jack: So, I think what happens is uh, I think instead- I think Franklin sees Paternoster, you know, like coming in at speed. But instead of landing to meet him, Paternoster just sort of like, flaps down to the- to the group near the front door. 
Austin: Mhm. Um, and you know, you kind of get in line, and you know, are- are ushered in until you know, you reach the guest- like, the checklist- the bouncer at the door who is like, 
[1:45:00]
Austin (as Bouncer): Um… Miss, I don’t… Excuse me. I wasn’t expecting you. I apologize. Uh, who are- who are you? Are you here with someone?
Jack (as Paternoster): My name is Paternoster. My- my publicist should have been in touch. 
Austin (as Bouncer): Your publi- your publicist. Your pub- What-
Austin: I also have a question, Paternoster. Should your publicist- publicist have been in touch?
Jack: I think that this is a complete bluff, but I think this is as much of a question as to how Amanda works than-
Austin: Right. 
Jack: [overlapping with Bouncer] I think Pater-
Austin (as Bouncer): Who is your pub- who is your publicist? Excuse me. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Oh, it’s-
Austin (as Bouncer): Who is your publicist?
Jack (as Paternoster): Uh-uh, Dialect. Amanada Dialect.
Austin (as Bouncer): Dialect. Ok. 
Austin: Um… give me a um… [tongue click and thinking noise] tchoo-tchoo-tchoo- Sorry, I’m tryin’ to get to this. 
Jack: [over Austin] There’s like, multiple ways this- this roll could go, right?
Austin: Oh yeah. 
Jack: Cause even with a success, it could be… Like, Amanda could have booked me in. And I just don't know it. 
Austin: Totally could have. Um, I think this is-
Jack: Or could just have not thought of this at all. Is this… is this Superior? It’s not- I’m not provoking someone.
[crosstalking]
Keith: It’s definitely-
Austin: You’re not-
Keith: You are pulling a ca- You’re- I’m- 
Austin: It is…
Keith: You’re pulling the ‘I’m famous’ card.
Jack: I’m pulling my Superiority. 
Austin: You’re pulling your superior card. Yeah, I think that’s what this is still. Because it’s ‘susceptible to your words. Say what you’re trying to get them to do, and roll Superior.’ Kind of- I’m not saying ignore the word provoke, but think about provoke in this broadest sense. 
Jack: Right. Totally.
Austin: So, yeah. Go ahead and give me that.
Jack: In the same way that it’s used in like, ‘provoke to action.’
Austin: Yes. Yes. 
Jack: Um… Ok.
Austin: So, that’s a seven.
Jack: That’s a seven. That’s a- that’s a hit. 
Austin: [reading] ‘On a seven to nine, they can instead choose one: they stumble- you take plus one forward against them, they err- you gain a critical opportunity, they overreact- you gain influence over them.’ Um, I don’t think- I think that they err again, and in this case, they go, 
Austin (as Bouncer): Amanda Di- Oh sh- You’re with Amanda. Amanada- ok. Uh, you just need- Wait right here. I- I need to make a call really quick. Just wait right here. 
Austin: And then they step aside and like, go into a- like, They walk into the corner and take out their phone and make this call. And they’re like, kind of pacing back and forth. And if you want to sneak in, you can sneak in now, but you will not have been approved. So on one hand, you can get in. On the other hand, this person will know you got in, and you’re not on the guest list still. 
Jack: Um… so-
Austin: Which could bite you in the b- in the ass in five minutes, you know?
Jack: Sure, but I don’t know what this call is. This could be a legit call, but it could also be like, ‘Come back. The Verandas want to have a word.’
Austin: Yeah. Exactly. 
Jack: Um, I think I’m gonna take- I think- I think it most honest to Paternoster to just like, turn and smile at the people behind her in the line and walk in. 
Austin: Mhm. Yep. Ok. So, you are inside. Franklin, Paternoster just went inside. What do you do?
Keith: Um… Oh, I’m also go- just going inside. 
Austin: So, you like, get in line and walk in and- But….
Keith: Oh, I- I thought- I was just gonna sneak in while there’s no one attending. I’m just gonna sorta-
Austin: So, were you in line with Paternoster?
Keith: Uh, when- I think when I saw what was happening, right?
Austin: Cause like, that is- There are other people between- There are people- It’s Paternoster and then some other attendees behind her who are waiting to be checked in. You- This would have to be a different roll. If you want to like, sneak in, in some way here, that would have to be a different thing, for sure. 
Keith: [over Austin] Mm….
Austin: The oppor- I’ll extend the opportunity, but it would still need to be some sort of Defy Danger-y type thing. Of some sort. 
Keith: [over Austin] No, if I just- If I can’t just walk in on coattails, then I- I think I’ll- I don’t know. Let’s see. What… I guess I can get onto the roof. Yeah, so I just go onto the roof. 
Austin: Yeah, you totally could. Ok. So, you are now on the roof of this place.
Keith: Mhm. 
Austin: You can see that there are some skylights you can look in. You can see below there is like, a nice carpet out. There is a nice spread of food, and there are lots of rich people wearing masks and jewelry and very fancy clothing. In fact, I think at some Paternoster, someone pulls you aside and says, 
Austin (as Attendee): Oh Miss. You need to have the mask on.
Jack (AS Paternoster): I do?
Austin (as Attendee): Do you not have one?
Jack (as Paternoster): Uh, no. I didn’t bring one. I’m sorry. 
Austin (as Attendee): We will- we will get you one. Come with me. 
Austin: And someone brings you over to the coat room and assigns you a mask. And just gives you a- like, a masquerade ball mask. I think it’s just like, green and gold. It does not match whatever you are wearing at all. 
Jack: Are these like, hold the mask up to your face on a stick masks? Or are these secured-?
Austin: [over Jack] There’s a mix. You get- you get a hold the face- hold up to your face mask, for sure. Uh… Bluefin and Tuna. How’s it goin’? [amused]
Janine: So, I have an idea.
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: About how… this should all go down maybe. [light laugh] 
Austin: Mhm. 
Janine: [clicks tongue] I feel like this would need to be like, a stolen moment with Elena and like, texting the others or something. 
Austin: Ok. You- you have plenty of time.
Janine: Yeah. Ok. So, I- I’ll just make this pitch. Here’s my idea. 
[texting]
Janine (as Grouse): Um, alright. So, Elena and I are on alarm duty. We’re supposed to pull the alarm. We supposed to distract the guards. Then Thresher and Co. move in to take the paintings and then extract. What if we pull the alarm early. The guards come towards us. Thresher’s gonna panic and not be quite ready to move in, but is still gonna move in. I got some albatrosses to steal the paintings, and then you guys close in behind Thresher as she moves in on the paintings that aren’t there anymore. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Ok, quick ques- [laughs] Quick question.
Janine (as Grouse): Yes. 
Jack (as Paternoster): I love all of it. Especially the bit with the albatrosses. Why are the albatrosses involved? 
Janine (as Grouse): They’re the largest birds native to this area.
Jack (as Paternoster): Sure, but like, [laughs] why are they stealing the paintings? 
Janine (as Grouse): To get them out safely.
Jack (as Paternoster): [over Grouse] Is it to get them out of Thresher’s arms?
Janine (as Grouse): Yes. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Ok. Ok. 
Art (as The Champ): Are birds good at stealing paintings?
Jack (as Paternoster): They are, I guess, if you’re telepathic and-
Janine (as Grouse): Birds are- Birds are good at a lot of things, if you explain to them what you need. [light laugh] 
Art (as The Champ): Fair enough. I didn’t- never thought beak pressure was-
Jack (as Paternoster): I- You know, I like this- I like this plan. Uh, I hadn’t thought of this plan as a- like, a framing of it where we could like… For some reason, I hadn't been thinking of this as an opportunity to capture Thresher, but when you put it like that, that is a pretty- you know?
Janine (as Grouse): Well, if we just keep fucking her up- fucking up her plans, then we’re- we- this could go on literally forever. 
Jack (as Paternoster): Right. Yeah, no. Absolutely. 
Janine (as Grouse): And she’s like, kinda neat, so that’s ok, but it’s also not. It’s- we all got stuff to do. Also, Waxwing would get on my ass about it, and I… 
Jack (as Paternoster): What’s the counterpoint, Franklin?
Keith: Oh, sorry. The counterpoint was out of character. Um… and it was- it was just that if uh- cap- capturing a villain so we never had to have them in an issue of the comic book again is very anti-comic book. [Jack laughs] 
Jack: There’s lots of ways that she could escape. 
Keith: Yeah. Yeah. 
Janine: Yeah, that’s not-
Jack: Or that it will almost certainly go wrong. 
Janine: Villains get captured in comics all the time. [laughs] It doesn’t mean anything. 
Jack: Um-
Janine: This is the thing you do cause you’re a hero. 
Jack: Maybe that’s what she wants.
Austin: Mm. 
Jack: To be captured.
Keith: Oh, the part of the larger plan.
Austin: [groans a laugh] 
Jack: Um… yeah, the famous Dark Knight line. ‘It’s part of the larger plan.’ [Jack, Keith, and Austin laugh] Um… let’s uh- 
Jack (as Paternoster): No, I’m up for this plan albatross- albatross plan. How many albatross can you call upon? And how are you gonna get them into an art auction? 
Austin: This is all great. Good questions. 
Janine (as Grouse): Um… 
Austin: Let’s find out in play.
Keith (as Mr. Good): What do I do? [Jack and Janine laugh]
Janine (as Grouse): Open windows.
Keith (as Mr. Good): I’m on the roof. 
Janine (as Grouse): You’re on the roof, right?
Austin: Oh, you know-
Keith (as Mr. Good): I am on the roof, but it’s skylights. 
Austin: That- that is-
Keith (as Mr. Good): It’s not really…
Austin: They could- Yeah. How big is an albatross?
Janine (as Grouse): Those are- You can usually crack ‘em open. 
Keith: Big. They’re big. Big enough for it to be-
Janine: They can-
Keith: -detrimental to have on your neck. 
Austin: They’re… big. 
Jack: [overlapped] So, is this- Is-
Keith: Yeah, they’re big. 
Austin: Albatross?
Janine: Yeah, they’re fuckin’-
Jack: They’re really- they’re really- [laughs]
Janine: [over Jack] Hang on. I actually- 
Jack: Sorry Keith, I just got your- [typing]
Janine: I was googling albatross stuff, and I got a picture of how big they are. Because they are quite big. 
Jack: Oh my god! These people are tryin’ to pick up an albatross in the worst way [laughs] possible. [Keith laughs] 
Austin: It’s so big!!
Janine: It’s like, if someone turned Kodiak into a bird. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: It’s- it’s nuts because they look-
Austin: Birdiak.
Keith: -they look like they’re the size of a seagull [Jack and Austin laugh] unless there’s anything else you recognize in the frame.
Jack: [laughing] These tiny men!
Janine: Yes. 
Austin: Grouse is actually a reboot of Birdiak, uh nineteen sixties era. [Janine laughs] 
Jack: Oh my god. [laughs]
Janine: Birdiak was her aunt, and she like-
Austin: Oh right. Yes.
Janine: -took up the mantel. 
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: I really recommend you looking at this image and- and performing the mental slight that turns this into a seagulls and these into really small men. [Austin and Janine laugh] [Art laughs] 
Austin: It is just like a really big seagull. 
Keith: [laughs] Yeah, it really is like a seagull that’s like, five times the size of a seagull. 
Art: Yeah, the only tip off is the beak. The beak is-
Janine: Yeah. Yeah.
Art: -is a little over sized. 
Jack: It’s pretty mean. Mm.
Austin: I thought the only tip off was it’s as big as that man. [Keith, Janine, and Jack laugh]
Keith: Well, it’s on a little- it’s on a little knoll. 
Austin: Yeah, a little bit. 
Janine: Also, like it’s not even- this isn’t even a picture of like… of like-
Austin: A big albatross. That’s just an albatross. 
Janine: It’s not- No, it’s not even a picture of like, scientists who have tranquilized an animal and they’re like, spreading its wi- they’re like, measuring. This bird is awake. It’s standing up. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: It’s waiting. [laughs] It’s waiting. 
Austin: It’s like it’s at-
Jack: [amused] It’s waiting. 
Austin: -it’s at a nice tailor is what it’s like. [Jack and Keith laugh] 
Janine: [laughs] Yes. 
Keith: Well, when you’re a big bird like that, I think you just get chill. 
Austin: Yeah, I guess that’s true. I could see that. 
Keith: [over Austin] Cause you’re just like, ‘What’s gonna happen? I’m a big bird.’
Austin: Yeah. I’m a big bird. 
Art: That’s bird’s gonna like the way it looks. I guarantee it. [everyone laughs] 
Austin: Alright, so plan albatross. 
Keith: Oh, look at these two. These two are really- these two with their little baby. 
Austin: Drop ‘em in. 
Art and Janine: Aww. 
Austin: Lil’ baby. 
Janine: Damn, fuckin’ eyeliner on point, too. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Keith: Can these two- can these two albatross steal the painting?
Austin: Maybe. 
[crosstalking]
Jack: So, is this the sort of-
Janine: Yeah, they got a family. 
Jack: Is this the sort of venue where there’s a live band? Or is this- [overlapped]
Austin: [over Jack] Oh yes. Absolutely.
Jack:  -the sort of venue where they’re playing… music on speakers?
Austin: Absolutely a live band. Upright bass. Cello. This is like, our- our like, jazz singer… like, situa- Not the movie, ‘Jazz Singer.’
Keith: No. 
Austin: Like, there is a jazz singer. There is a woman who is singing some jazz tunes. 
Keith: [over Austin] It’s the song- it’s the song they added to Jabba’s Palace? It’s that.
Austin: [starts] It- No, it’s not that song. It’s not that- It’s- it’s much more restrained than that. Again, like it has to be a little corny, right? So, it is not a good j- She’s fine. She’s doing a fine job. 
Keith: Do you not think that the gen- the Star Wars genre ‘Jizz’ is a little corny?
Austin: I think it’s corny in a different way. [laughs] Um, she is not like- This is not an explosive performance. This is a very background performance. This is like, the elevator music of live music performance. You know what I mean? She’s not tryin’ to wow anybody. The band is not here to wow anybody. The band is here to provide background for elicit talk to happen under. [light laugh] Um, and that talk is happening, and I think Paternoster, you’re- you’re catching little glimpses of it here and there. 
Jack: Ohhhh.
Austin: There is definitely a lot of horse trading going on here. Literally and figuratively. 
Jack: Is this- is this um, that great scene in the newest Mission Impossible movie? Uh… where they go to see the- the British lady in the- in the bar. The thing that feels like a Hitman level. Do you remember, Austin?
Austin: I’m thinking about it. 
Jack: They show up in this incredible jazz club. 
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: And there’s a fight-
Austin: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. 
Jack: -in this jazz club. 
Austin: Yes. Yes, totally. Or it’s the jazz club from hit video game, The Quiet Man. [Jack and Janine laugh] Either one. Either one.
Jack: It’s the jazz club from hit video game, The Quiet Year. [Austin laughs] 
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: Which is a prequel to The Quiet Man. 
Austin: Yeah. They’re actually directly connected if you play them. Um, so yeah. 
Janine: What a weird thing to say. 
Jack: So, I’m just hearing about like… I’m hearing about like, low- low tier to high tier criminal activity that’s happening.
Austin: Yeah, but often legitimate activity. It’s just shady. You know what I mean? 
Jack: Right. Right. 
Austin: It’s rich people shit. 
Jack: It’s like,  ‘we’ve acqui- we’ve acquired a load of boats, and we’re gonna sell ‘em.’
Austin: Exactly. Do you know a buyer? And- who knows how they acquired them?
Jack: So, what rich people talk about?
Austin: Yeah, ba- Listen, I met- I met a particularly wealthy industry veteran once. Games industry person whose not in the press and whose not a developer, and I’ll leave it at that. And I walked into a conversation, and he was telling two friends of mine in that conversation that he would- couldn’t decide which boat to buy. Which yacht he wanted to buy. And he was having a- an argument with his spouse about it. 
Jack: [groans] Oh my god. 
Austin: And it was the most like… fuckin’- I fuckin’ hate rich people. [light laugh] 
Jack: Yeah, for real. 
Austin: Um… so yeah. That was- that was- Like, just- just buy the fuckin’ boat you wanna buy, ok? You don’t need to tell me about it. Anyway… um… so yeah. That is what’s happening here. People outside- I guess- I guess Franklin, are you- What are you doing while waiting for this to all unfurl?
Keith: Um, have I- We’ve just been texting the plan back and forth?
Austin: Yeah. Uh huh. 
Keith: Ok. Um… I guess I look for a window I can open.I’m just kind of up here. 
Austin: Ok. Are you just like- are you just looking for windows to open? There are windows you can open, for sure.
Keith: Ok. 
Austin: Are you just gonna like, hang out until things pop off basically?
Keith: Um, yeah. I don’t re- I don’t think there’s really anything else I can do. I guess I could-
Austin: O-
Keith: I mean I guess I could do some sneaking around, if there’s- but- cause I’m dressed like I was gonna be a criminal tonight. 
Austin: You are- you are dressed like that. Yeah, totally. 
Keith: Um… I’m just gonna wait it out, I guess. 
Austin: Ok. You open up those- you open up those- those windows. It’s not a problem. This is- Like, Paternoster, it gets a little drafty down there, for sure. You can hear the birds getting into position. Alright, let’s- let’s zoom in on the action. Let’s get ready for this to pop off. 
[Jack de Quidt’s “When Justice is Done” begins playing] 
Thresher, Alana- er not Alana- uh, Alandra Alvarez tells you to- to go ahead and move up, Team- Team Tuna Fish. 
Austin (as Thresher): We’ll be- we’ll be right here in the van. Get ready for it.
Austin: And the vans are parked down on the street just like- at the bottom of the boardwalk ramp, basically. And the two of you head up, and you sneak up. 
[Music picks up lightly and plays through to the end]
