Bluff City 42: Engines on the Track Pt. 01
Transcriber: anachilles
[“Engines on the Track” by Jack de Quidt begins with steady synths]
Austin: [rhythmically] From the pier, I
watch the bay.
The rain is falling, 
the water ripples. 
What does it say? 
[high percussion kicks in]
Little stories 
come and gone, 
little heart attacks. 
A missing child, 
a stolen painting, 
[‘engines start’ synth beep] 
engines — on — the track.
[music shifts into uptempo]
Austin:         [reading through static] Atlantic City, sometimes referred to by its initials, AC, is an elevated resort city in Atlantic County in the US state of New Jersey. The city is known for its casinos, boardwalks, and holographic beach. Atlantic City inspired the US version of the board game Monopoly, which uses various Atlantic City street names and destinations in the game. From 1921 until 2033, Atlantic City was the home of the Miss America pageant. In 1976, New Jersey voters legalized casino gambling in Atlantic City, and the first casino opened in 1978.
[synth vocals kick in for a bit]
[music slows again]
Austin: [rhythmically] From the shoreline, I
[tripled audio] witness 3 pasts. 
Empty promises, 
radio stations, 
movie studio collapse.
[tripled audio] From Blough City / Bluff City / Bluffington Beach I
take in the view. 
Who is missing? 
When is going, gone? 
[‘engines starting’ synth beep] 
What — is left — to do?
[drums and audience noise kick in]
[the encyclopedia article and poem begin to play at the same time]
Austin: [cross, reading] In 2023, the Tri-City Tunnel Authority successfully connected Atlantic City to two neighboring municipalities, Blough City and Bluff City, the latter of which became the home of the Miss America Pageant in 2033.
[cross, poem] I'm right here 
but I'm there too. 
Got a slot machine's perspective. 
I'm in the third place,
I'm in between. 
I'm biting back invective.
Austin: [cross, reading] In 2041, much of what was once Atlantic City was re-designated as an unincorporated area, leaving only the casino district intact. As of the 2050 census, the city had a population of 8256, a decline of 32261 residents or 79.6% from the 2000 census.
Austin: [cross, poem] I am Atlantic. 
I am city. 
I am Black and Blue. 
I am nothing. 
We are nothing. 
Baby, this town's through. 
Austin: [cross, reading] From September 2014 until the de-incorporation in 2041, the greater Atlantic City area had one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, beginning at 13.8%, out of a labor force of around 141,000, and declining significantly in the following decades.
Austin: [cross, poem] We're in the marsh, 
outside your bar, 
cheek to cheek, alone. 
Dancing to the roar 
of the gravity cars 
and the piano’s semitones.
[Engines on the Track” concludes]
Austin:        Welcome to Friends at the Table, an actual play podcast focused on critical world building, smart characterization, and fun interaction between good friends. I'm your host, Austin Walker. Joining me today is Sylvia Clare —
Sylvi:        Hi, I'm Sylvi. You can find me on Twitter at @Sylvibullet, and you can listen to my show Emojidrome wherever you get your podcasts.
Austin:        Ali Acampora.
Ali:        Hi. I'm Ali, you can find me over at @Ali_West on Twitter. You can find the show over at @friends_table.
Austin:        And, Art Martinez-Tebbel.
Art:        Hey, you can find me on Twitter at @atebbel, where everything I don't tweet has been tweeted forever.
Austin:        [laughing] that's not — that doesn't —
Ali:        [snorts]
Art:        That's the same thing. Same as this guy.
Austin:        Uh-huh. We're always referencing our favorite time.is quotes here at Friends at the Table. To let us continue to do thats [laughs] you can support us by going to friendsatthetable.cash. Uh, today, we are continuing season 2 of Bluff City. I know, it's still season 2? Yes. By playing Gravity Rip, a Sci-Fi racing RPG by Luke Westaway, with illustrations by Collin Craker. You know, I don't think there are principles in this game, but... go fast and play to find out what happens? I don't know.
Ali:        Go fast is exactly what I was thinking.
Austin:        Is it? Is that the — is that what you were thinking?
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Go fast?
Ali:        Go fast.
Austin:        Is there a list of Fast and the Furious principles that I should know, off the top of my head, that I don't?
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        I mean, I guess it's, “I live my life a quarter mile at a time.” But that feels like that was so long ago.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        I guess it's like, something about family, probably, right?
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        I think it's still, “live your life one quarter mile at the time.”
Ali:        Yeah.
Art:        I think we've just really changed the focus of, you know —
0:04:17.2        
Austin:        I don't think it's the same —
Art:        That's about, like —
Austin:        I think he's changed!
Art:        No.
Austin:        Yes, because he has a family now.
Sylvi:        I was going to say, a lot of the stuff that I, as a casual, just sort of, peeking in, it feels like it's very father-based, now.
Art:        But he's had the family — he was the father figure of that family in the first one.
Ali:        Uh-huh.
Art:        It's just the literal, the literalness of the family has changed, and that's really not what family is, is your literal family, that's the point of the movie.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        No, I get it. But living your life a quarter mile at the time means taking things as they come, and that is not what he does anymore, because he's making specific big life choices to keep people safe.
0:04:58.4        
Ali:        No, because the literal last movie was like, I... I wasn't myself when I asked my kid to hide in that closet, and now I'm — racing is my true self. So I think it's still —
Austin:        Oh, he's back to...
Ali:        Yeah, it's still...         live your life a quarter mile at a time.
Austin:        But it's less healthy when you have a literal child.
Ali:        [chuckling] Yeah, but it's like, if, if my kid is going to be in danger anyway, I've got to do whatever it takes, and that means... [wheezes] whatever happens in that quarter mile, I leave it there —
Austin:        Right.
Ali:        And that's, [chuckles], you know?
Art:        There's also like the, the philosophy, “live your life one quarter mile at a time,” —
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Art:        And the literal, “live your life one quarter mile at a time,” when you're doing a street race, slash —
Austin:         Right, yeah, I gotcha.
Art:        Car crime.
Austin:        Car crimes happening, right, I see, I see. Of course, of course, of course. Um, anyway [chuckles] we're playing Gravity Rip, and I think I've been pitching this to y'all for, when I first conceptalized this season as being a weird thing where we would be going back and forward in time across Bluff, Blue, and Bluffington, one of the forward in times would be, what if we did a cyberpunk [chuckles] Fast and the Furious. Uh, and at the time, we didn't have a game for it that I was like, you know, I was like, oh, we could revisit something we've already played, which would be fun.
0:06:24.8        But, Gravity Rip came out, uh, and Gravity Rip is sort of like F-Zero, or, what's the Playstation hover racing series — wait, Wipeout. Uh, but also, like, if you've read this book, you know that there are absolutely some Fast and the Furious type sequences described, in which there are assassination attempts, and heists described, and shit. So I felt like this could be a thing that worked for us. It is, very clearly, you know, pulling from something like Lasers and Feelings in terms of its off-the-track stuff, and a little bit more complex than that on-the-track. It has some really fun, some really fun stuff in terms of, uh, the way it, it tracks out, you know, where and how, you know, the race is going. Uh, I think it's pretty good. Uh, but we should kind of get into it. I guess I'll, I'll begin reading from, from towards the top about what the game is and how to create characters. [reading] Gravity Rip is a cooperative tabletop RPG built to tell the rad-as-hell story of the fearless pilots who compete in, this says the Rip Racing League. We are not going to be in that, like, universe. We are very much in future Bluffington.
0:07:41.2        This is the same world that we've seen in Dream Askew, before the Dream Askew, and after Tales from the Loop, this kind of like, increasingly futuristic, but also increasingly desperate, real Atlantic City. At this point in my mind, the setting is like, quite literally stratified between a sort of upper tier of Atlantic City, and a lower tier, uh, to the degree that like, we have the classic, you know, layer of fog or smog separating the top from the bottom, you know? That style of thing. Like, to the degree that we have, like, hover roads, uh, uh, in fact, maybe this racetrack, which is the sort of, you know how Fast and the Furious has like, the local racetrack?
0:08:33.9        You know how real places have like, the local racetrack?
Art:        [laughing]
Austin:        But mostly California.
Art:        Wait, [unintelligible]
Austin:        All of those. You know how those things are real, [chuckling], how like, but also how they're centered to the Fast and the Furious mythology? You know what I mean, right? Like... not big deal race, not Nascar racing, like —
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        Local track racing, right?
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Art:        I do know what you mean, and I'm going to really save it for the Fast and the Furious cast that we're going to have, I suppose after 10 comes — after the Franchise ends.
Art:        Right, right, and we wrap up.
Art:        We'll have a retrospective —
Ali:        Oh...
Art:        Where we all talk, and we all get our feelings out, and what the locations of the series mean.
Austin:        Right. And that's where you'll talk about that at length, I gotcha. Yeah, sure.
Art:        Right, I don't want to really drill down on this right now. Because it's not what we're here to do. But —
Austin:        Right, I appreciate that, Art. I do.
Ali:        [snorts]
Art:        But I have thoughts.
Austin:        Uh, well...
Art:        I did a lot. I'm still, I'm still working on my Fast and the Furious game —
Austin:        Mmm, mmm, mmm mmm.
Ali:        Oh.
Art:        And so I've thought a lot about places in Fast and the Furious —
Austin:        I see. Okay.
Art:        Movies, as I struggle to make mechanics that work.
Austin:        Oh, sure.
Sylvi:        That's bad, you need mechings when you're doing a race. Thanks very much, I'm going to go now.
Ali:        Mmm.
Austin:        Mmm. I see what you did there. I see what you did there, Sylvi.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Sylvi:        That's my one joke for the episode.
Austin:        Really fun. Yeah, of course.
Sylvi:        Yeah, I know.
Art:        Oh, it's so early.
Austin:        [laughing] We're coming off of a, a Bluff that had maybe too many jokes per minute, [unintelligible] points, so —
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        I'm happy to be able to get through this episode without losing my breath at some point, you know? In any case, the, uh, the game is split into two modes. There is a sort of story mode, which is the one that is kind of lasers and feelings-y, in terms of pure mechanics. And the other one is a racing mode, which is like, you versus, I guess 17 other racers, 20 racers in total. Where there will be lots of like, I'm going to try to move up past them, I'm going to try to slam my car into their car, I'm going to try to deploy this illegal car mod, whatever. You know. Race car shit. The stuff that race cars — that happen with race cars. Uh —
0:10:50.5        
Art:        Yeah. Race car shit! Race car shit!
Austin:        Yes. Thank you, yeah. Uh, I will read from the “how to win” section, so we're all on the same page. First, don't die. Because if people die, people are — because if you die, people are going to say that you lost.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        Beyond simple survival, success in Gravity Rip is completing the objective as described by the GM. I'm going to say — I'm going to give you a little bit of color for starting off here. And I know you haven't even made characters yet, but maybe this will help you think about who your character is, and who they are in relation to each other. The three of you are part of a racing team. I don't know when you got together. I don't know if this was a... like, a, you know, kind of boy band situation where you were all plopped together on a team, or if there was, like, actual history before this, this season of racing or what? But, the season didn't go well. A sponsor paid for you to, to do the, to like, be their team. And one of the conditions was basically like, we're only paying for the season. You'll have to earn enough to buy your entry into the next season of competition. And the season ended and you did not have enough money.
0:12:02.9        But, there's one more invitational tournament that includes some people from a higher racing league, and there are lots of cash prizes. And so, you need to make, uh, I guess there's, there's a chart in here on how much money you can make from, from winning various positions. And also, [chuckles], also from like, doing exciting things like slamming into other cars, and maybe even [laughing] destroying other cars, uh, and getting money from the, the video, the kind of like, poster of that, of that, uh, event. Uh, you need to make 4 grand. That's pretty easy, if you, if you're like, in the top few slots. But if you end up, like, in like 12th, 13th, and 14th place, you're not going to make what you need to make it into the next season of racing. Uh, and if that happens, we'll just keep paying. I'm sure there'll be a fun hook —
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        For what happens after that with your crew. Uh, and I don't know who your sponsor is, because I'm not just going to hoist that on you. Foist that on you, not hoist it. And I'm not going to tell you, like who the other rivals are yet, unless you're like, really need someone to be, to frame up against. Uh, but that's what I got in terms of like, the premise here, in terms of where we're kicking off today. Uh, uh, I'm trying to think if there's anything else here before we talk about character creation. Uh, you need a D6, we got that.
Sylvi:         [laughing]
Austin:        We've got some stuff to keep track of stuff. Uh, ba ba ba ba ba.
Ali:        I love that this game is like, you might want a pen to keep track of your whatever. Like, I definitely own a pen, [laughing] what are you talking about?
Austin:        You've got to fill pages. [laughing] Yeah, but, you know, you don't know.
Ali:        [snorts]
Austin:        Some people might not know.
Art:        I'm not going to use a pen at all, though, I'm [unintelligible]
Ali:        I — it seems to really undersell what the task of playing a game is.
Austin:        [laughing] All right. Um, Gravity Rip takes place in the far future, across, for them, a sprawling, chaotic galaxy amid a riotous clash of alien cultures. We're in Bluffington. We're in Atlantic City, but there has been bleedover in this time from Bluff and Blue. As a reminder, like, the state of things in the timeline – Bluff — Bluff has seemingly, via the tunnel project, been siphoning life out of Bluffington Beach, out of the real world. Uh, things have become increasingly, like I said earlier, desperate. Uh, uh, the people who are left, are either kind of like, barely getting by at this point, or are extremely rich. Bluff, Bluffington itself, and Atlantic City, have kind of — the, the kind of polarization, the stratification, like I said, has, has moved to a high, high level. But, if you still wanted to be someone who had a real flair, as if they were from Bluff City, that is acceptable, you know?
0:14:57.2        I will tell you, some of these NPCs are not human, is what I will say.
Ali:        Oh, okay.
Austin:        So. Uh, uh, their suggestions include, a member of an octopod alien species with a penchant for gambling, the laziest lycanthrope —
Sylvi:        [chuckling]
Austin:        From planet alpha werewolf X. An impeccably dressed robot from the showtunes quadrant, or a human surgeon, who discovered their dexterous hands and lightning reflexes could be put to a more profitable use behind the wheel. It's up to you. Uh, when creating your racer and their backstory, here's what to bear in mind. One, their physical form can be anything, but it should be able to fit inside of a cockpit, or, you know, for our cases, a... car. Uh, seat.
Sylvi:        [chuckling]
Ali:        Mmm.
Austin:        Uh, it'll probably make things easier if your racer can communicate in universal, the most widely spoken language in the known galaxies. I'm not saying they need to speak English. Uh, that would be shitty. But I do think, you know, keep in mind that, that you're, you're going to be people, maybe another way of thinking about that for us is just like, you should know your way around a race track, and the things that — the culture of this sort of thing. You're about to race in the fastest, most advanced, and deadliest form of anti-grav racing around. The first time you play is highly unlikely to be your racer's first time behind the wheel. Although, if it is, hey, best of luck to 'em. Uh, so think about how they got to that point. How did they first discover their aptitude for the sport, and what makes them good at it. Uh, four, a bit like real-life formula one, Rip racing stars belong to racing teams and race for both personal glory and the advancement of the team as a whole.
0:16:25.4        Your teammates are your fellow players, and meeting your objective will depend on cooperation both on and off the track. How will your racer fare at working with others? Where do their priorities lie? Uh, so that's —
Art:        Just, just for, just for clarification's sake —
Austin:        Yes.
Art:        We're going to be speaking English though, right?
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Yes, that is correct. I would appreciate it —
Art:        Okay, great.
Austin:        Since it's the only language I —
Art:        Okay.
Sylvi:        It would be a real power move to do a whole session —
Art:        Yeah.
Sylvi:        Where your character spoke another language, though.
Austin:        It would be an incredible power move. You'd have to, you would have to provide subtitles for the —
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        Rest of us in chat. I would appreciate it, thank you.
Art:        Well, I mean, it would be like, galactic standard. So like, it wouldn't be, it wouldn't have to be a real language.
Austin:        I see.
Art:        I could just do like, you know, the, the, the star, the, the Kotor thing, where it's like —
Austin:        [wucha shaka paka], over and over again.
Art:        Yeah. Like —
Austin:        Exactly, yeah.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        I'm glad we both have drilled various bits of Kotor alien sound into our brains. Ugh. Fuck. Coming soon on Switch.
0:17:30.5        
Ali:        Available on Switch.
Austin:        Oh, is it out now on Switch?
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        This makes it sound like it's an advertisement. Our —
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Exact exchange — “oh, is it out now on switch?” Is —
Ali:        I'm just saying, buy it so they can [unintelligible]
Art:        I hear it's a very reasonable price.
Sylvi:        Somehow a banner ad is appearing on our listeners' phones right now.
Austin:        No! Ugh.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        Send us a money, Lucas or whoever it is.
Austin:        No, Lucas, Lucas should do it. Lucas should send us some money, IMO.
Ali:        George —
Sylvi:        I've, I've listened to the Star Wars podcast. He owes you and Ali.
Austin:        George Lucas —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Thank you. Appreciate it. Ugh, god. So, that's backstory stuff. Do y'all want to like, take a second to think about that stuff? Or do you want me to explain the stats of your character and your machine first?
Sylvi:        I feel like it makes —
Austin:        Is that like a holistic thing?
Sylvi:        I personally am like, I think just like, would make sense for the listeners to have all of the, like, mechanical stuff on the table.
Austin:        Totally. All right, so, uh, now that you've crafted a rich backstory for your racer [chuckling] — [laughs] —
Ali:        [laughs]
Austin:        It's time to boil all that work down to a single number on a sliding scale that will represent their entire personality. This is chaos theory, chaos/theory, and it's one of the mechanics that governs whether actions in story mode, which is, again, the non-racing portion of the game, succeed or fail, along with the reputation roll. More on that later. Assign your character a number, on a scale from 2 to 5. The higher the number, the more your character operates on chaos. The lower the number, the more they're governed by theory. Characters who lean towards chaos are driven by emotion, favor decisive action, and may have more success manipulating the feelings of others. Characters on the theory end of the scale are logical thinkers, and may be calculating, scientifically-minded, and likely to remain clear-headed during a crisis, or when caught unawares.
0:19:27.8        Uh, can we get, can we get some Fast and the Furious scores for characters here? Uh, uh, or, or rather, some, some —
Art:        Sure.
Austin:        What, what are we, what are we thinking? It's like —
Art:        Well, it's like, Tej is very high theory. Tej is probably like a 5.
Austin:        Yeah, I mean, Tej and Roman are the 5 and the 2, right?
Ali:        Oh, sure.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        That's easy.
Art:        Uh, and I would say, like, Bryan is a 3 and Dom is a 4?
Austin:        Sure. I think that, I think that's exactly right. All right.
Art:        I don't think that's necessarily true for every sequence in every movie, but I think if I had to give them a permanent number —
Ali:        [chuckles]
Sylvi:        Do you have a number for Sean Boswell, the protagonist of Tokyo Drift, one of the 3 —
Ali:        Ooh.
Sylvi:         Fast and Furious movies I've seen?
Art:        Uh-huh. Uh...
Sylvi:        Yeah, [unintelligible]
Ali:        Okay, so, uh, the scene where he's racing through the town against the kid... Home Improvement while Kid Rock plays, he's a 5.
Sylvi:        Mmm, yeah.
Austin:        Uh-huh. Yeah.
Ali:        And then, [laughing] — I guess he's a 5 for most of that movie, but drifting —
Art:        And then — he's a 5 for most of that movie, yeah.
Austin:        But he's surrounded by —
Art:        But I would say, in the most recent movie, when he makes a spaceship, —
Sylvi:        What? [laughing]
Ali:        Oh, true.
Art:        He's closer to 2.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Closer to 2.
Ali:        But he's 5 when he's in space.
Austin:        He doesn't go to space, does he? Or does he —
Sylvi:        He doesn't go to space.
Ali:        Oh, that's true.
Austin:        No, he sends, he sends other characters —
Ali:        He's in the plane.
Austin:        I won't say the — yeah, and he's [unintelligible]
Art:        I guess, I guess maybe he's a 3. He's maybe the most chaotic person in the spaceship crew.
Sylvi:        I've really got to watch these movies.
Austin:        You gotta. Sylvi, I'm going to need it to happen. Uh...
0:21:01.4        
Art:        Shoutout to Fast and the Furious for putting out their most recent movie in the 2-week span where it looked like it was safe to go to movie theaters again. That was really cool of them.
Austin:        [chuckling]
Art:        I got to go a movie and not feel like I was in danger.
Austin:        All right. Whether you favor chaos or theory, decisions in Gravity Rip are entirely yours to make. Push your racer to their limits in pursuit of glory, and be ready to face the consequences of your behavior both on and off the track. Chaos/theory governs how your racer reacts to challenges off the track, but makes no difference whatsoever in racing mode. Whether a cold-hearted android or a furious lizard king, every competitor got here by being exceptionally skilled at piloting their Rip racing machine.
0:21:47.1        Which is why players must also create and customize a vehicle to race in. Uh —
Art:        It's why, it's why Roman can be a 2, but like, whenever he's in a car, everything just happens.
Austin:        Just works, yeah, exactly.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        Uh, uh, [chuckles] — despite their imposing size — in, in Gravity Rip, these cars are like tanks in terms of size. They're like a ton. I mean, cars are a ton. This describes it as being a flying tank. I think we're probably not as big as flying tank. I think we're probably more like car, a flying car. More like flying car, less like flying tank. More like hovercar in my mind, right? We're, again, like — I think like F-Zero or Wipeout is the right space of like, this looks like a car from the outside. It hovers above a track by, you know, a couple feet. Uh, maybe some of them are very wide and tank-like, and I do think that they could be built to, like this says here, whatever shape and style requirements you desire — a needle-nosed acceleration machine, a bullish heavyweight designed to smash the competition to shrapnel. Perhaps you prefer an aerodynamic all-rounder, effortlessly weaving its way through the pack.
0:22:51.5        Absolutely think that that is acceptable. We should get really wild here, but also, I promise that someone has a Honda Civic. One of these characters drives a Honda Civic. So like, that's the — the range —
Art:        But like, a foot hover Honda Civic.
Austin:        Huh?
Art:        A hovering Honda Civic.
Austin:        A hovering Honda Civic, correct. Yeah.
Art:        So Honda's going to make it.
Austin:        Yeah, they're going to probably make it. That's my guess.
Art:        Okay, great. Great.
Austin:        This is, you know. I hope that we don't get sued, also. Uh, for saying Honda.
0:23:19.1        
Art:        I would love to get sued by Honda, are you kidding me?
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        What do you think that would do? Art, we're not big enough for that to turn into money for us.
Art:        I think it, I think we could make it something.
Austin:        No! Oh, boy.
Art:        [chuckling] We get sued by Honda, we — I think we get a lot of attention we don't have right now.
Austin:        Not if this conversation is on tape. Because then there's no real you lawsuit.
Art:        Ali, destroy this, it's evidence in the lawsuit —
Austin:        Oh, right.
Art:        We haven't been served yet, you can destroy anything you want.
Ali:        Oh, like, I cut it out of the episode, and then we get sued, but then like, Discord releases our – [snorts]
Austin:        Yeah, see —
Ali:        Our recordings to the police —
Austin:        Then we're big, right?
Ali:        And then it comes out later, and they're like, “shocking podcast reveal.”
Austin:        Well, and then, then everybody hates Discord, because this also happens the week that Discord —
Ali:        Oh, true.
Austin:        Debuts their NFT integration, and —
Ali:        [chuckles]
Austin:        And then, then it's good for our careers. Anyway, for the purposes of the game — [chuckles] uh, a name and a rough verbal description of your machine will do. Though, heck, if you're good with a pencil, feel free to put everyone else around the table to shame with a flawless actor architectural drawing... don't do that, we don't have time for that. And don't shame anybody, please.
0:24:26.7        The track performance of a Rip racing machine is represented by two stats or modifiers: acceleration, and weight. Your machine starts with a modifier of minus one in both of these categories, and when creating it, you have four points to distribute however you choose. Acceleration determines your machine's ability to put on a terrifying burst of speed through grav-release thrust rerouting, a real thing. Acceleration is vital for overtaking in one on one encounters, and a high acceleration modifier increases how far you can advance through the pack each lap. Weight, uh, Rip racing is an aggressive sport, and it pays to have a machine that can withstand a deal of punishment, as well as dish it out, of course. Machines with higher weight modifiers have increased integrity, which means they can take more damage before exploding, and are effective both at smashing opponents in the side of the track and blocking overtakes from behind. Your machine's modifiers in acceleration and weight affect how successful particular moves and maneuvers are likely to be. Read on to racing mode to see, blah-blah-blah blah-blah. There's a great diagram here on page 7 of super nimble little hovercar on the left —
Sylvi:        [chuckles]
Austin:        And then just like, big impressive and — uh, uh, imposing —
Sylvi:        It looks like a speaker.
Austin:        Rip [chuckles] on the right. It does, 100 percent. Uh, if you have played, uh, uh, Mario Kart, I think this makes sense, right?
Sylvi:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        Mmm.
Austin:        You go fast, or you're big. Big is better at hitting things, getting hit, staying stable.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Fast is good at fast.
Art:        Fast, is good at fast.
Austin:        Fast is good at fast. Uh, I'm not going to keep reading here, but like, you know. Uh, integrity is your car HP, you know? And you can repair your car, you can upgrade your car using a, uh, a resource called volts, et cetera. There's some illegal mods, which I guess, if someone has an idea for an illegal mod, we can talk. But for now, I think that that's the gist of it. I guess I'll say, that there is another, there is one thing that didn't come up here, which is your reputation, which is not a score. It's, it's the same as your chaos or theory. But it's basically, whenever you reference a thing that happened in the most recent race, you get to roll — as like, a way to try to like, throw your reputation around, um, uh, you can roll a second die and take, take the one that you want, the one that's better for you. So like, you know, the example in the book is, uh, someone wants to like, you know, intimidate somebody else.
0:27:06.9        Uh, and so that's a chaos roll. And, and the player says, actually, I want to make this a reputation roll. Remember how I slammed two racers off the track in [chuckles] yesterday's race? And how one wasn't even a rival of ours, just a shmuck who had the temerity to attempt an overtake? Well, word travels, right? So the security jerk likely thinks I'm just savage enough to try and kill him right here just for the hell of it. And so, yes, you can call it on that reputation in this, in that scene. So, you don't have that think about that while creating characters, but it's a fun little twist on the chaos/theory lasers, feelings thing. So, so yeah. Uh, name, background, look, chaos/theory score, and machine name, description, and score. Uh, I've got assigned character sheets here, but let's just, order at the bottom of the screen, Sylvi, Ali, Art. The roll20 screen, that is.
Sylvi:        Okay.
Austin:        Uh, and I will also work on some stuff. [chuckles]
Sylvi:        Do we want to like, figure out like what our crew's deal is before we really get into it? Or does any, do, do some, do you guys have some really strong character ideas already?
Art:        No, I would, I would love to have, like, a little bit of — because we all just like, show up with 5 [unintelligible]
Sylvi:        Yeah — [chuckles]
Art:        It would really be a problem, right?
Ali:        Well then, we will — we'll mesh. [wheezes]
Austin:        Wait, what'd you say?
Ali:        [cackling] We'll have a very specific team build.
Austin:        Oh, right. Right.
Ali:        And we'll be solving very specific problems.
Austin:        Mmm, mm-hm.
Sylvi:        I'll be a 6, just to — actually, wait, I can't be a 6.
Art:        All right. That's a, that's a no collaboration [unintelligible]
Ali:        [cackling]
Art:        From Ali, I guess. I also already see that they have, that there's a name for this character [laughing]
Ali:        Hey!
Art:        And it's not what I thought we were going for [laughing] —
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:        [laughing] Oh, I love it.
Art:        With the racing names, so —
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Art:         Uh...
Austin:        That's a great, that's a — I could see that character in Fast and Furious.
Sylvi:        I love it.
Austin:        We'll get there.
Art:        Uh-huh.
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Ali:        Yeah, I am.
Art:        Yeah, so I guess it would be unsporting of you and I to talk, Sylvi, I think —
Ali:        [snorts] What are you talking [unintelligible] [laughing]
Sylvi:        I, you know, I'm, I'm happy to work with —
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        I don't want to say, I don't want to be the one to say the name —
Ali:        I —
Sylvi:        I'm happy to work with this, though.
Ali:        Sure. [cackling]
Sylvi:        It's not my reveal to do.
Austin:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        You know? Like, I don't want us to [unintelligible]
Austin:        No, it's not. It's not.
Art:        Uh-huh.
Austin:        Uh-uh.
Art:        No matter what ancillary character in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise you want to name your character after, fine.
Austin:        [cackling]
Ali:        Hey! There's a lot, it's, it's a personality type.
Austin:        It is.
Ali:        It's a... you know. [laughing]
Austin:        I was going to give a clue. I was going to say something that would have been too much of a clue.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        I was going to mention a different video game series, so —
Ali:        Oh, sure. I did my homework, okay? [laughing]
Austin:        You did.
Ali:        I have numbers.
Austin:         Damn, that was quick.
Ali:        [wheezes]
Sylvi:        I mean, I do have like, a general idea for my character, which was, I was going to play like a mechanic type thing, uh, which I could lean towards —
Ali:        Ooh.
Austin:        Okay.
Sylvi:        More technical or more chaotic, depending on how our team is balanced out. But I'm leaning towards like, being like a 2 or a 3.
Art:        Well I don't, I don't want to speak for Austin here, but I think you can bump your chaos theory up or down at will, until we actually start —
Sylvi:        For sure, that's why I'm saying, like, I'm, just giving you a temperature check.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Art:        Yeah, that's a great —
Austin:        Right, I appreciate it.
Ali:        [chuckles] I was thinking of being like a 4.
Sylvi:        Okay.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Ali:         Art, how are your vibes?
Art:        I'm, I'm leaning toward, I — I mean, I guess I said 5 because I'm really thinking about just going for — I've never done like an all-the way-character —
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Yeah, sure. Sure.
Art:        And I'm thinking of just doing a 5 and doing fast, and just fucking holding on, you know?
Ali:        [laughing] Okay.
Austin:        Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Sylvi:        Oh, man. Okay. Yeah, so I'll probably be the technical one of the group, then. I think that works out.
Ali:        Okay. Sure. Yeah.
Sylvi:        So I'm going to put that down as like a... mmm. Do I want to do a 2? Do I want to, do I want to stab both ends of the spectrum here? I'm thinking. Yeah, I'm going to do that, fuck it.
Ali:        So we have a 2, 4, 5.
Sylvi:        Man. You guys got good names —
Austin:        Love it.
Sylvi:        What the fuck.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        Yeah, uh-huh.
Ali:        Do we want to move on to cars now? I had a car.
Austin:        Oh, I thought people were just doing, I thought people were doing all of it.
Ali:        Okay.
Austin:        Because I read it all, so I felt like you could just go for it at this point.
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Austin:        I want names, I want a loose description, I want the whole thing.
Ali:        Okay. Yeah. I, I have a car [chuckles] in mind. I was like — okay. So, I was like, can I just Google a car that looks like a bullet?
Sylvi:        Fuck yeah.
Ali:        [laughing] I didn't do that. I think I Googled space car. Anyway, so I found like a real car that exists, in real life. You can Google the Reactor, in parentheses, show rod, on Wikipedia, to find this. The picture I saw of it was —
Austin:        Oh my god.
Ali:        [laughing] this. And it's like, it's like a pointed —
Austin:        Oh, that looks sick.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        Oh my god.
Austin:        Where are the other tires — oh, I see them now, I see the tires now.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Okay.
Ali:        Here's a big Tumblr post of different angles. Okay, so it's like a pointed, acid-green car.
Austin:        That thing rules.
Ali:        It looks like it only has 3 wheels, but I think it has all four. It's just, they're slightly wider in the front. Like, maybe a foot apart. But then when you go to the back, they're like, really up against each other, and like, tucked into the car.
Austin:        Is that? It is. That is —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        That is a young William Shatner as Captain Kirk [unintelligible] the tire.
Ali:        Yeah, so apparently, this was in an episode of like, Bewitched. Apparently Catwoman drove it once, and they put big cat ears on it.
Austin:        Oh, I love that.
Ali:        [laughing] the more it —
Art:        I hope they repainted it. The colors are not right for — oh, no, they didn't.
Ali:        They did not. [laughing]
Art:        They just went for it.
Austin:        They did put —
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:        [chuckling] they did just up — have you seen the photos?
Art:        Cat ears is really not saying what I think the headline of the cat modification —
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:        [laughing] Oh my god. I — oh my god. Look at it!
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        I don't want to.
Ali:        It looks amazing.
Art:        Look at that mouth.
Austin:        I don't want to anymore.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        To be fair, the Joker is also in this car.
Ali:        Sure, yeah.
Austin:        Which I think help explains why it looks like this.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        I think this —
Art:        How does that help you explain that?
Austin:        What?
Art:        [laughing] how does that help you explain that?
Austin:        I — it's a prank. The Joker did this as a prank on Catwoman.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        She's driving.
Austin:        Right, but she came out, and they, they had to go to get groceries, and he was like, “ha-ha-ha, I gotcha.” And she's like, “well, fucking get in, I'm out of Sprite.”
Ali:        [giggling] It matches both of their aesthetics, I guess.
Austin:        Yeah, it's a little mix. A little mix and match.
Ali:        Uh-huh. Anyway, the more I looked at this car, and the more I thought of like, the 1960s platonic version of like, a cool space car in —
Austin:        Yeah.
Ali:        Bizzaro, far-future Bluff City, I was like, this is...
Austin:         Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Ali:        [snorts] I've cast this car.
Austin:        That's it. Yeah. Yeah. It's simply the truth, isn't it?
Ali:        You know? [laughing]
Austin:        Yeah.
Ali:        And the machine name is the Sharpshooter.
Sylvi:        Oh, hell yeah.
Austin:        Oh, sure. Of course. Love it.
Ali:        [laughing]
0:34:40.4        
Austin:        Uh, what are your — what's the stats?
Ali:        So, my stats are going to be, uh —
Austin:        Wait, wait, wait! Do we not even want to reveal that until we're all just —
Ali:        Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Austin:        Is this also not a — okay.
Ali:        [laughing] I mean, I've, I've, I've, I have stats that I would like to have.
Austin:        Uh-huh. No, you're allowed to put them in.
Ali:        But I'm interested in [unintelligible] [laughing]
Austin:        But you, you've established we don't want to team build.
Ali:        [laughing] Saying — [laughing]
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Art:        All right. I also have a reference image now.
Austin:        Ooh.
Art:        Oh, wait, I don't know if this is a real link. Fucking Bing.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        I'm trying to use Bing, I think it's [laughing] sporting of me.
Ali:        … huh.
Austin:        You know? That's fair. Okay. Let's go around the table, let's get full character name, chaos/theory, machine name, description, and score. Sylvi, you are on the left. You begin.
Sylvi:        Okay. So, my character's name is Wrench. Uh...
Austin:        Oh, we should have pronouns on these too, probably. If possible.
Sylvi:        Pronouns are she and her. My chaos/theory score is 2.
Austin:        Which is the most theory — most analytical, most theoretical.
Sylvi:        Yeah, uh, and so her whole deal is that she's like the team mechanic, she's like, basically like lives in the garage, uh, is kind of how people describe her.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Sylvi:        I've got like a picture of like, there's a little — [chuckles] it's like, always in like, like a mechanic's jumpsuit, and like, backwards cap with like racing goggles over the top of them.
Austin:        Of course. Yeah, uh-huh.
Sylvi:        Uh, yeah. A lot of my inspirations for this are like, Speed Racer and Redline, so like, you know.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Hell yeah. Love it.
Sylvi:        Uh... Yeah, so my car is called the Cherry Bomb, and speaking of Redline, it's really based off of the like muscle car that the dude in Redline drives. Which, apparently is called the Trans Am 20000. I'm trying to find a pretty solid picture of it.
0:36:42.4        
Austin:        Yeah, these are, this is a cool looking fucking car.
Sylvi:        Yeah, it rules. Uh —
Austin:        I'm, I need to watch Redline.
Sylvi:        Oh, you do.
Austin:        It's bad that I haven't. I know. I know.
Sylvi:        Uh, here. I got one.
Austin:         God. The main character of Redline's name is Sweet JP.
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        That's extremely good. Ugh...
Sylvi:        There, I put a couple in the, uh, Discord.
Austin:        Hell yeah, this looks great.
Sylvi:        It's like, bright red. Hence the name. Uh...
Austin:        Right, sure.
Sylvi:        There might be like some fire decals on there.
Austin:        Not just a, not just a Tyler the Creator —
Sylvi:        You know what? That is where I got the name, Austin.
Austin:        Okay. Let's go.
Sylvi:        I'm not going to lie.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        You know, you already know what the fuck it is. You already know.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Ali:        It's a good album.
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        Uh, Ali, you're up next.
Ali:        Uh, yeah. I'm playing Froggy. Froggy is they/them. Uh, my chaos slash theory is 4. So, leaning towards chaos, but —
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Ali:        Not pushing it. Uh... [laughing] my machine name is —
Austin:        No, no, we've got to — what's Froggy's deal? What's Froggy look like —
Ali:        What's [laughing] Froggy's deal?
Austin:        What's Froggy's deal?
Ali:        I mean, I wasn't sure how like, alien we were being.
Austin:        Well, not literally aliens.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        But you could be a frog person if that's a thing you're talking about.
Ali:        [laughing] Sure.
Austin:        But that seems on the nose —
Ali:        Yeah, I didn't know that, I like, I was thinking like, maybe I could, could have cool, like, grav gloves.
Austin:        Sure, grav gloves could be fun —
Ali:        And then that would be like, amphibian-esque, because they're like, [laughing] sticky —
Austin:        I see. Yeah, uh-huh.
Ali:        [laughing] But, you know. Froggy is also the sort of name that you like, get when you're a shitty kid in a streetcar gang, and like, it sticks with you.
Austin:        So is that Froggy's background?
Ali:        I think so.
Austin:        Froggy like, from the streets, has been... around, like the car scene for a long time.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Et cetera.
Ali:        Yeah. Yeah.
Austin:        I actually bet, down below the fog, they race real metal. They race real cars. They don't race these hovercars. So I bet you drove, you like, grew up driving cars that were on the ground. You know?
Ali:        Oh, sure sure sure. Yeah.
Austin:        Not this like, spectator sport hovercar shit.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        No offense, it's dangerous, people die —
Sylvi:        [chuckling]
Austin:        It is what it is, but —
Ali:        Yeah, I mean, you know, it's just, you know. It's two different versions of a thing.
Austin:        Right.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        So tell me about your machine. You've already told me what it looks like.
Ali:        Uh, yeah. The name of my machine is the Sharpshooter. As I said before, it's basically the reactor by Gene Whitfield.
Austin:        Oh, what are your scores? We didn't — Sylvi, what were the Cherry Bomb's — did you say that?
Sylvi:        Oh, no, I didn't. Mine is acceleration 0, and weight 2.
Austin:        Okay. And then, what is the Sharpshooter's score,
Ali:        Uh, that is acceleration 2, and weight 0.
Austin:        Did I steal the name? Did you say the name yet, or did I just steal it from you?
Sylvi:        Nope. No.
Ali:        No, I — I said it.
Austin:        Okay. Okay, okay. So yeah, acceleration 2, weight 0. Okay. So you two are flopped on that.
Sylvi:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        All right. Art, tell me about your character, and your machine.
Art:        Uh, my character is Trip Uncertainty.
Austin:        Great.
Art:        Um, I do realize I've now done two Bluff characters in a row with a one-syllable first name and a three-syllable last name, and I pledge to change it up in the future.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Okay. Mix it up, I appreciate it.
Art:        Uh, I'm trying not to like, fall into a rut here.
Austin:        Yeah, isn't that all of us.
Art:        Uh, Trip's pronouns are he/him, and has a chaos score of 5.
Austin:        Phew. Extremely emotional, extremely impulsive.
Art:        I think of — uh-huh. And I think of Trip as like, like a washed-out pro racer.
Austin:        Okay. So you were on, like the national circuit before.
Art:        Or like... I don't know how a lot of racing works.
Austin:        It's like horses, it's the same thing.
Art:        Uh, but I know that like, in... I think there's like, multiple like, tiers. You kind of like, work up.
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        And I think you like, like, Trip got to like, 1 or 2 levels down.
Austin:        Gotcha.
Art:        So like, if you were like, a real racing superfan —
Austin:        You knew —
Art:        Maybe you know who Trip is, but like.
Austin:        You're like, “oh yeah, Trip did really well in like the E-series this year,” or whatever.
Art:        Yeah, or like, you know how Nascar has that, like, where they drive pickup trucks?
Austin:        Mm-hm.
0:40:55.8        
Art:        Like that, you know?
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Art:        But like, no one cares, no one — you know, you have to be like in a racing bar before anyone is even like, buying them a drink.
Austin:        Uh-huh. Uh...
Art:        No offence to the people who drive pickup trucks for Nascar or whatever, do you.
Austin:        Yeah, I hope that — you know, I bet that's fun.
Art:        Um...
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        And scary. Uh, what are your, or, what's your machine, and what are, what are its stats, and what's its deal?
Art:        My, my machine is the Liminal Space.
Sylvi:        [chuckling]
Austin:        Mmm.
Art:        Which I think, much like it's used on Twitter in the present is just like, a phrase that he heard —
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        And just used it for the car, and has no relation to the actual meaning of the term.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Art:        And for what it looks like, I did a great image search for Formula 1 car Future —
Ali:        Ooh!
Art:        And got —
Austin:        Ooh!
Art:        Yeah, this real Batman-looking motherfucker right here.
Ali:        Oh, wow.
Austin:        See, the one thing I will say about this is, it does look like what I imagine Batman's razor looks like, also.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Art:        [chuckling]
Austin:        If Batman got a deal with Gilette, this is what they would make. And also it has tires on it.
Art:        Yeah, uh-huh.
Austin:        It's sick. I like it. I can see why —
Art:        I didn't like, read the post associated with this, so I don't know like [chuckles] how few —
Ali:        [snorts]
Art:        For all I know this is like, this is from 3 years ago. But like —
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        This looks like a fucking future car to me.
Austin:        It does. You're not wrong. It does look like that. I'm now worried, though. What if it's a bad car? What if they're like, I hope all the cars that look like this... suck.
Art:        [wheezes] Well, I'm really just going for vibes.
Austin:        That's true. That's true. Vibes immaculate, as they say.
Art:        And then for stats, I went for acceleration 3, weight, negative 1.
Austin:        Okay, so you're —
Art:        [unintelligible]
Ali:        Awesome.
Austin:        Right, so this is in some ways a good partner to the, your chaos, your high chaos.
Art:        Yeah. I'm not, I'm not hedging a single thing on this one.
Austin:        Uh-huh. I'm worried about how it's going to go, but I guess that's what it is.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        So, talk to me about your relationship with each other, and your crew, if, if, you know. I mean, you have one, I've told you this. You've raced together for a season already. So tell me what that's been like. Tell me how you got put together. Are you people who knew each other, or... it does kind of sound like someone, like, just grabbed the three of you and put you on a team together. But you tell me. You also could have known each other from the neighborhood back in the day, I don't know. What excites you?
Ali:        It seems like, Wrench could be the anchor here, right?
Austin:        Oh, right...
Sylvi:        Mmm.
Ali:        Where it's like —
Austin:        Yeah.
Ali:        She worked on both of our cars, it's like, oh, I know this guy, he used to race —
Austin:        Right.
Ali:        He's looking for a team.
0:43:43.3        I know this new person, looking for a team.
Austin:        Right.
Ali:        Now we're a team... [wheezes]
Austin:        So then, also, Wrench, maybe you secured the sponsorship? Like, through some connect that you had. Like, maybe you worked with a certain company or something at some point in the past —
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        And like, they, or has like, we'd love to get a team back together. We were out of the, we were out of the game for a few years ago there, but we need you to help us put it together, and you were like, “all right, I'll find 3 people.” And you only found 2 people.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        You found Froggy, you found Trip, and that's why you are also a racer and not just the mechanic.
Sylvi:        Oh, I love that. I love that.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        That's a great pitch. That is perfect.
Austin:        What's our — does anyone have any ideas for who your sponsor is? Like, what advertisement is [chuckles] all over your car?
Ali:        Oh...
Sylvi:        The conversation from earlier does make me want to suggest razors. Uh...
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Oh, that's very funny. Yeah.
Ali:        You sure you don't want to go for the Mac Tonight Nascar car?
Sylvi:        Oh... oh, boy.
Ali:        [giggling]
Sylvi:        Oh, boy.
Austin:        Can we get an image in the chat, please? Can we get a —
Ali:        Gimme a second, gimme a second.
Austin:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        Oh, that's a real thing. Oh, okay.
Ali:        [laughing] yeah, yeah, yeah.
Austin:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ali:        Oh yeah.
Sylvi:        Oh, boy.
Austin:        Yeah, I think I got it. Yeah, there it is.
Art:        Oh, it's not loading.
Austin:        Oh, it's so good.
Art:        Oh, wow.
Sylvi:        Wowie, okay.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        It's number 94, Mac Tonight Car.
Ali:        [snorts]
Sylvi:        That's beautiful.
Ali:        This is Bill Elliot, he was a superstar.
Art:        Can I buy this car? Can I get like a hot wheels of this?
Ali:        [chuckles] yeah, yeah. Here's a little die-cast model for you. With Mac Tonight [chuckles] on the box.
Austin:        Oh, wow.
Ali:        [wheezes]
Art:        Oh, well this is a bank. I can keep money in here.
Austin:        Art, you can keep money inside of just about anything.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        I'm saying, it's an investment, you know? Like —
Austin:        It is. I mean, you're right, you're right. That's actually true. You're, you're not wrong.
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        Wait, Ali, you said, this is Bill Elliot, he's a superstar, like that's a thing you knew. Are you secretly like a Nascar —
Ali:        Oh, my dad's a Stan. My dad's like a big Nascar guy.
Austin:        I got you. My grandfather was.
Art:        I was like, my dad's a big Bill Elliot —
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:        My grandfather was for —
Ali:        I think he was in the day, yeah.
Austin:        Richard Petty, Richard Petty was his guy, and like —
Ali:        Oh.
Austin:        One of the things that he gave — one of my inheritances was a Richard Petty model car, a model Richard Petty car. My grandfather collected Nascar models.
0:46:09.0        
Art:        I went to a Nascar race once. Uh, and we got like, it was like, it was like a thing we intended to do. So it was like, I have tickets, and like, garage passes for this Nascar race. We're like, okay. And Jess and I went, and... it was so unbelievably loud.
Austin:        Oh, I bet.
Ali:        [chuckling] Yeah?
Art:        That we just like, we left at like, after, I don't even, I don't even know. We were there for like an hour, and then we were like, well, we've seen this —
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        And it's really unpleasant to be here. [chuckling] So we should go.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Uh, all right. So, wait, did we decide if you were [chuckles] Mac Tonight or the razor company?
Sylvi:        Oh, we did, we did establish in the, uh, the Tales Bluff City game —
Austin:        Yes. Yes.
Sylvi:        That there was the shitty casino slash pizza place.
Ali:        Oh...
Austin:        I do have to tell you, I do have to tell you that that place, the Upper Crust, already has a racer.
Sylvi:        Aw, okay.
Ali:        [gasps]
Austin:        I'll tell, I'll tell you more about him —
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        When he shows up.
Ali:        [chuckles] Okay. Wait wait wait. We can synchronize the ideas here, right?
Sylvi:        [snorts]
Ali:        Instead of [chuckles], instead of working for a razor company, we work for like a barber shop.
Austin:        Mmm —!
Ali:        And the mood —
Art:        Oh, I was going in a completely different direction.
Ali:        [giggling] and the moon guy —
Art:        I was like, “we have shitty pizza” —
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali:        The moon guy is their mascot, because it's like, oh, you'll get such a clean shave —
Austin:        [incredulous] You'll look like the moon?
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:        Have you seen the moon?
Art:        The moon famously has no hair on it.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Yeah, but — [laughing] but also, it's not smooth.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        It's all cut up.
Ali:        But Mac Tonight is very... [laughing] clean shaven. True!
Austin:        Ugh.
Art:        A crescent moon is very smooth.
Austin:        In this scenario, also, you're a barber. You're [unintelligible] it's a barber shop. Are you talking about like, a barber shop? Or are you talking about Supercuts?
Ali:        [giggling] Well, I mean —
Austin:        [laughs]
Ali:        How much are barber shops making in Bluff City at these times —
Austin:        Probably not a lot, honestly — well...
Ali:        Yeah...
Austin:        Well, not enough to sponsor — I guess —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:         Hm, uh, no. Maybe it's a — okay, but maybe it's a — maybe it's like, a barber shop that's managed to just barely hang on to being in like, the middle district, like right where the smog [chuckles] the smog layer starts, but like, just on the quote/unquote right side of it.
0:48:43.2        And it's been tough going, but you know, they're like a local joint that's hung around for, you know, since like, 200 years going, or whatever now. And, uh, and that's why they've been out of the game, and why they can't sponsor you again next season. So — you know —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        You know. Or they'll happily, maybe they'll cover some, you know what I mean, maybe they're not out of it, but it's like, you know, we can do this much next season, and that's enough to cover you all the way. You'll have to kick in the extra 4 grand, and you've not made that — or, it was probably more than 4 grand. But where you're at now is, you need 4 more grand of credits or whatever to do it. Speaking of resources, everyone should take one radical bonus.
Sylvi:        Oh...
Austin:        Uh, everyone starts with one. You get another one by like, a sick thing happening. Uh, uh, and, uh, uh, or like, you do a good roleplay scene. And you can spend those to reroll a roll, after you've done it, I believe. I'm going to double-check that that's true.
Ali:        Oh.
Austin:        Uh, the radical bonus. If, in the course of the game, you show incredibly initiative, smarts, or top-tier role-playing, your GM may choose to reward you with the radical bonus. This bonus lets you do over any dice roll, and pick whichever of the two results you like. Uh, you can also, there's also a mechanic called overclocking, which is where, during a race, you sacrifice integrity to add to your number. Uh, to your, to whatever your roll ends up being, and you have to determine before, before a roll. So, you know. Uh, keep those in mind as we get into this. Uh, I think that we're ready to go if y'all are. See, there's a notes section here, feel free to write stuff down as you feel necessary. Uh, again, I'm going to use this GM cheat sheet, and kind of, for people who can't see it, there's a sort of first to 20th grid on my screen that lets me know where people are in the placement, so to speak.
0:50:43.0        I'm not tracking 20 different racers. What I have, basically, is a list of racers that I've made, plus, including some people who are kind of rival-tier racers. And those racers are, uh, those racers I'll be tracking more directly, if that makes sense.
Ali:        Mmm.
Austin:        They will have actual placements. Um, uh, I guess, so, so let's start with, with a broad question. What is your pre-race, uh, ritual? And, and what is the mood like in, we need a name for this barber shop?
Art:        Moon cuts. Uh...
Austin:        Keep going, keep trying.
Ali:        [snorts]
Austin:        I know you got this one in you, Art.
Art:        Uh, uh...
Austin:        It's not Moon Cuts.
Ali:        [cackling]
Sylvi:        [cackling]
Art:        Uh, Crater — Crater Face.
Austin:        Nope!
Ali:        Colder.
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        Uh, uh, Milky Way Men's Haircuts. Uh, uh...
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        What was the saying again? You had a saying —
Art:        Big Dipper, uh...
Austin:        Yep?
Art:        Barber shop. Uh, uh....
Austin:        I might have been wrong on this one.
Art:        Uh, uh, sun's out, scissors out. Uh...
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        That's like a... that's a nightmare, actually.
Ali:        We don't think it's Milky Way [laughing] men's hair cuts? We sure?
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Art:        Jup- Jupi-... Jupit-hair Cuts!
Austin:        [cackling]
Ali:        [cackling]
Sylvi:        No.
Art:        Uh... uh... mmm...
Austin:        Hoo!
Art:        Astronaut Haircuts. And they're like, freeze-dried. Like Astronaut Ice cream.
Ali:        Oh...
Austin:        The scissors —
Art:        They freeze-dry your hair at the end of it.
Austin:        The scissors have actually been stored in dry ice.
Art:        There you go, uh-huh.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        Uh...
Ali:        It helps your follicles.
Austin:        Right. God...
Art:        Orbit Cuts. Uh...
Austin:        Orbit cuts! Orbit — Orbit feels close.
Art:        Geosynchronous Style.
Ali:        Mmm... [chuckles] Orbit Style?
Art:        Uh...
Austin:        What's that?
Ali:        Orbit Style?
Art:        Sure.
Ali:        That's a character name, not a —
Austin:         Orbit — it is more of a character name.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        Uh, Smooth like Moon? But you have to sort of like, say it like it's the beginning of that BTS song?
Ali:        Mmm.
Austin:        [laughing] I'm really impressed you keep, you're continuing to go. You keep having these, good.
Ali:        [chuckles]
Austin:         Because it's hard, for what it's worth. This is not easy.
Art:        Yeah, uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh... Asteroid Belt Barbers?
Austin:        Asteroid Belt Barbers.
Ali:        Yeah!
Sylvi:        Oh, you mean ABB? ABB.
Ali:        [giggling]
Art:        Yeah, ABB.
Austin:        You know ABB? Yeah, you know me.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        That's how that, that's how the song goes.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        You down with ABB? Yeah, in the commercial —
Art:        Oh, no!
Austin:        That's what they play.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Y'all are in the commercial, and you had to cut the commercial —
Ali:        Oh yeah.
Austin:        You had to do the like — when I — this was absolutely starring Trip. Trip, you had to —
Ali:        [snorts]
Austin:        You were given a piece of copy, and it was like — when I need to get my hair cut, I go to ABB. Where the hair cuts are out of this world — I can't do your character voice because I don't know your character voice yet, but you know —
Art:        Sure.
Austin:        It's one of those.
Art:        Yeah. You know... us.
Austin:        [laughs] That's how it goes, yeah.
0:54:08.1        All right. So, anyway, what is the, what is the vibe? What is the ritual like in team ABB? Uh, uh, kind of, not headquarters, but a garage?
Sylvi:        I think I'm a little stressed? I don't think Wrench is necessarily super excited about racing, instead of staying in the garage.
Austin:        Mmm.
Sylvi:        [chuckles] And fixing things up afterwards —
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Sylvi:        I'm like, picturing the Cherry Bomb as being sort of like, a precious car to her. Like, it's like, her best car, but also, she's like, “why do I have to race this thing? It's my baby.”
Austin:        Aw... [chuckling]
Sylvi:        So, I think it's just a lot of her just like, double and triple checking like fucking everything that she's got going on.
Austin:        Mm-hm. How about the, the rest of you? Froggy and Trip.
Art:        Uh, you know that song before the Bulls went on the court in like 96?
Austin:        [scatting] bow bow bow, boom boom boom bow boom bow boom bow —
Art:        Yeah, I think like, that's just playing.
Ali:        [snorts]
Austin:        That's an all-timer. Do — Ali, do you not know —
Ali:        [laughing] No!
Austin:        The song, the Alan Parsons Project, Serious?
Ali:        [chuckling] No, no.
Art:        [also scatting the theme]
Austin:        You don't? You truly don't?
Sylvi:        That's a good rendition.
Ali:        I really don't.
Austin:        Oh, it's, it's the hottest shit that's ever — this is like —
Ali:        [snorts]
Austin:        There's nothing I wouldn't want to do while this song played, in terms of like, getting myself hyped up for it. It's great.
Ali:        Was this playing in, like, you were sitting in the seats waiting for them to come out, and this would play?
Austin:        You're sitting, this is their, this is their entry music. When they're like —
Ali:        Oh.
Art:        They're [unintelligible]
Austin:        Now coming out, Michael Jordan! Whatever.
Ali:        Oh, sure.
Art:        Yep.
Austin:        Yeah, uh-huh.
Ali:        I've heard this before, I think.
Austin:        Yeah. It's from this.
Art:        Yeah, because you've been alive on the planet.
Ali:        [laughing] I just don't think I've heard it in the context of baseball.
Austin:        Oh, boy.
Ali:        Basketball.
Austin:        Basket — basketball.
Art:        Basket —
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:        I mean, Michael Jordan did play baseball, but they didn't play this when he was on his way out, though.
Ali:        You know?
Art:        Maybe they did.
Austin:        That's very funny if they did.
Ali:        [scatting the theme] Okay, I got it. [laughing]
Austin:        Uh-huh. All right.
Art:        We're making it sound a little banjo-y, and I want to just stress, if you're listening at home, it is not banjo-y.
Sylvi:        Sick if it was.
Austin:        It would be kind of sick if it were, you're not wrong.
Ali:        [chuckling] Serious Chicago Bulls theme song, banjo cover.
Austin:        Banjo — oh, you know that exists.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Because of what you just did. Someone did that once and was like, “that sounds like my banjo — let me go get that out.”
Ali:        Oh, true.
Austin:        And, and they hammered it out. You know it's true. Anyway. Uh...
0:56:47.4        What, uh, what about you then, Froggy? What's the pre-race situation for Frog —
Ali:        Yeah, I think, I think for Froggy there's also a tension there, because it's sort of like, this race is kind of make it or break it for the team.
Austin:        Yeah.
Ali:        So I think it's a lot of careful, like — I'm sitting in my car, making sure the switches flip.
Austin:        Right.
Ali:        I'm making sure I feel good in here. [chuckles]
Austin:        Is there any pre-race conversation?
Ali (as Froggy):        Good luck, everybody.
Art:        I think there's like, I think there's some strategy, I think especially like, if, uh, if, if uh, if Wrench is nervous, it's like, “you know, turn 4, you've just got to try to like, you approach from the outside, you cut in.” This is the problem, is that I don't know what race strategy sounds like, so I don't know how to say it.
Ali:        [snorts] That sounded right.
Art:        Maybe it is!
Austin:        [chuckles] Uh...
Art:        It's very hard to prove it isn't.
Austin:        Have y'all done any, like, scouting on the rest of the racers? You know, classic, walk around the other garages, or look into... you know, what other, other —
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        People's racing has been like, et cetera.
Sylvi:        I think like, we've mentioned that, like, I've worked with other people before. Like I probably know —
Austin:        True.
Sylvi:        Some people who are in the race, even, just as like, been part of pit crews in the past or whatever.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Sylvi:        So I imagine we've done a little bit of scouting through that.
Austin:        Uh, so then, yeah. I, I, I will tell you, there are, besides you 3, there are 17 other racers. Uh, the, you know, you never know who's going to win. There's always someone out there who could, who could pull it off. You'll encounter many of them over the course of, you know, what happens here. Uh, uh, the, the ones that are — let's say the ones that are — you've each encountered, uh, let's say one rival, but one of this is a rival team, uh, uh, over your time period, in this situation.
0:59:02.3        Uh, let's start with... let's start with... I guess, we'll, we'll start with you, Wrench. You used to work for, or, briefly, you were employed by the Tiger Bite, uh, snack food company, as their in-house race — sorry, sorry, uh, uh, mechanic, their race mechanic. Uh, and you know that they have probably the tightest team on the, on the field today. Uh, they did really well in — so you probably all know them in general, but you know these three actually super well. And it is Tate, Baby, and SC.
Art:        Great.
Austin:        And they are, uh... [chuckles] do you know, do you know, those, those, that art, of like Hood Tony The Tiger?
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Ali:        Mm-hm!
Austin:        Yeah, it's three of them.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        Wait.
Austin:        Yeah, what's up?
Art:        Can I, uh...
Austin:        Oh yeah. You want me to put some of that in the chat for you.?
Art:        Yeah, please do.
Austin:        I'm just going to put this one.
Art:        I've —
Austin:        You've not seen these.
Art:        I think I do, but I'm not sure. And, you know, better safe than sorry.
Austin:        Yeah, always.
Ali:        There's the classic one of Hood Tony the Tiger wearing the Supreme shirt, which is made into a shirt.
Austin:        Yeah, there's that one, yeah.
Art:        Wait, is this one —? Is this one making drugs?
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Yeah, yeah, he's hooking it up, right now. What's wrong?
Art:        Who makes these?
Austin:        Horny people.
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Art:        Oh, this is like — that, that explains the nipple.
Sylvi:        That's usually the answer to things, honestly.
Austin:        [cackling]
Sylvi:        Who made — oh, horny people.
1:00:36.0        
Austin:        Yeah. This is a whole subgenre of furry art that I think is extremely good, actually. Uh, and it's, it's —
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        But like, the, the —
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Art:        The Tony the Tiger on your cereal box doesn't have —
Austin:        Nipples, I see what you're saying.
Art:        Uh, prominent nipples, and I don't think that's how tigers' nipples look.
Austin:        I haven't really investigated, frankly.
Ali:        I [unintelligible]
Austin:        I don't think the [chuckling] artist did, either. I don't think that's what the artist had in mind.
Sylvi:        [chuckles]
Austin:        In any case, you've worked with these three before, Wrench, back before, uh, they, they were doing as well as they are. They basically got a huge cash injection because they were fan favorites, because why wouldn't they be? And they got a, they got like a more professional mechanic than you. They got, they like flew in someone from Germany —
Sylvi:        Wow. Wow.
Austin:        Or whatever. Anyway, their general deal is that like, Tate is out here to win, out here to compete, you know, love of the game. Uh, they put — Tate is the one who is like, “we put the bite in tiger bite,” you know what I mean? They're the one — Uh, Tate is the one who's like, most on-message. SC wears nice suits. That's the thing about SC. You know that SC wears nice suits and drives trucks that look like bricks. Like, that is just, the biggest, baddest car that you can put on there, that's what SC drives. And then Baby also, also calls himself The Striped Sensation and The Second Heat, and some other AKAs, uh, and —
Sylvi:        Mmm.
Austin:        Is the kind of, you know, the loudest and most debatably charismatic, the bad boy of the trio. And you know that Baby's car is the fastest of the three, for sure.
1:02:26.9        Uh, Froggy, you know a kind of local, a local person here. Uh, local is actually the wrong word — hm, is local the wrong word? I guess, sometime in the last [chuckles] couple generations, uh, some people moved to town and tried to muscle in on the kind of local crime, uh, circuit —
Ali:        Oh, sure.
Austin:        Here in Atlantic City/ Bluffington Beach. They're from Bluff City originally. Anyway, this is Sonny Veranda the 3rd.
Sylvi:        Oh my god.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        But he goes by Fast [unintelligible]
Ali:        Fastos?
Austin:        [chuckling] Yes.
Ali:        Okay. Just checking.
Austin:        Like the —
Art:        Just fast, with O-S on the end.
Austin:        Yeah. Fastos. Uh-huh.
Art:        Fastos.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Art:        Fastos.
Ali:        Is he, is he going for like a Greek, like — situation? Or —
Austin:        Like, he really likes classic movies.
Ali:        Okay.
Austin:        And he recently watched The Eternals —
Sylvi:        Fuck off.
Austin:        And likes the character Phastos.
Ali:        Wow.
Austin:        And so he — but he got rid of the PH and put an F there. He used to go by Sonic, because —
Ali:        Wow!
Austin:        That was the last movie he'd seen that he thought was real good.
Ali:        Stop it.
Austin:        Listen —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        I had to give Sonny Veranda the worst ending possible in every time he shows up, and so now his like, great-grandson is just the worst person.
Ali:        At least —
Austin:        He's actually really nice. He's actually really — Froggy, he's actually like, he — the real truth about him is, he doesn't give a fuck about racing, but his family sees it as a place where they can like, launder money, basically.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        And he doesn't want to do that. He wants to like, watch movies. And he likes, and he likes cars, but he isn't interested in like, the crime aspect of it so much. He likes to collect cars, he likes to drive cars around. He's a nice guy, but he isn't — you know, he's just not a great racer. He's an okay racer. Anyway, he —
Ali:        Can I just, can I —
Austin:        Yes.
Ali:        I'm sorry. But can I make a suggestion that his last name was at least Detective Pikachu? Because the Sonic movie was not that good.
Austin:        He doesn't have good taste.
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:        Also, it's like 80 years in the future, 100 years in the future.
Ali:        Sure, sure. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Austin:        Everyone's taste is bad, because they weren't here. They didn't know better. They were like, “oh yeah, that movie did great. That was the last movie everyone saw before Covid hit.”
Ali:        Sure.
Austin:        It was a classic, it really brought everyone together in troubled times. This was real shit.
Ali:        [sighs]
Art:        People love that movie.
Austin:        People love that movie. Anyway, he drives the Medium Pizza Half Off At the Upper Crust, which is a Honda Civic with —
Ali:        Wow.
Austin:        It just says, medium pizza half off at the Upper Crust. And you get a half-off if he wins a race — or if he comes in the top three, you get a half-off medium pizza.
Ali:        [unintelligible] with him? [chuckles]
Austin:        If he wins, you get a free medium pizza with the purchase of any other pizza. So —
Ali:        Oh, wow.
Austin:        He has never won, I don't think, like one, one. He's top 3, he's, uh —
Art:        I say let him win.
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali:        Oh yeah, then we all get pizza at the end of the day.
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        Then we all get pizza.        
Austin:        Oh, tight — uh, Tate, Baby, and SC, they drive the Tiger — Tiger Bite Yellow, Green, and Black. It's just very simple names. Their — their car colorations do look like the Lays potato chip, like, regular, plain, uh, sour cream and onion —
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        And, uh, uh, —
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Barbecue chip bags, just for the record. Uh, and then finally, you've raced against another guest racer here, Trip. Uh, you have raced against Absolute Pluperfect, who drives the Absolute class, when you were a higher-up racer. When you were in, uh, whatever E-league, whatever I said before, you know, a couple, couple stops away from the top, uh, Absolute Pluperfect was, maybe not your rival then, but if you want that to have been the case, you know, they could have been that. Uh, but they are — you went down and they went up.
1:06:13.1        They are now a superstar at the top of like the Formula 1 super league or whatever, right, the hover league. And they are here because they're being paid a lot of money to be here, as like a guest to get more eyes on this race. Uh, they drive a super fast car, quite like you. So, that's the — in my mind, also, Absolute Pluperfect is like, one of the twins from the Matrix, you know?
Sylvi:        Oh, boy.
Art:        Mmm.
Austin:        That's my, that's my image of them in my head. If you don't know who they are, just type in [chuckles] Matrix twins, and you'll be like, oh, okay. [laughing] No, you won't. Because if you don't know who they are, and you see these people for the first time —
Ali:        [chuckling]
Art:        They look like nothing.
Austin:        They look like nothing you could ever — yeah. Uh-huh. All white everything, including the dreadlocks.
Ali:        Uh-huh!
Austin:        Anyway, so that's the lowdown on the rivals you're going to have to keep a count of. Otherwise, uh, there are, you know, besides those 5, there are a bunch of other racers out there, and I have names and cars for them all. But they only come up if they happen to come up, you know? So, uh... I think that that's probably the run down. Let me finish setting up my overlay here. I need an image for — oh, I know who it is.
Sylvi:        Do we have — so we have decals on our cars for the — for our sponsor, too?
Austin:        Oh, absolute, right?
Sylvi:        Okay. Wrench has been apologizing to her car about that the whole time.
Austin:        [snorts] Are you like in that sort of relationship with the car —
Sylvi:        Yeah, she's like —
Austin:        Where like — you can tell it's upset about it.
Sylvi:        “I'm so sorry I let them do this to you.” She calls her car Cherry like it's their first name.
Austin:        Yeah.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        [chuckling] it's like that.
Art:        That was like a song lyric. I, that's, that's — it's poetic. So you kept me like a secret, I kept you like an oath, or whatever the —
Austin:        [laughing] Is this, is this in character from Trip, listening in?
Art:        Listening in and a big Taylor Swift deep cut fan, in the future.
Austin:        [laughing] God.
Art:        It's not a deep cut right now. I think it's going to end up a deep cut.
Austin:        I see what you're saying.
Art:        I'm just, I'm just calling a shot [unintelligible]
Austin:        Yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotcha.
Sylvi:        Centuries later, still mad at Jake Gyllenhaal.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        God. All right.
Art:        I don't think any of us need excuses to be mad at Jake Gyllenhaal.
Sylvi:        I mean, he's smelly, that's enough for me.
Ali:        Is he smelly?
Sylvi:        There was that whole story where he talked about how he doesn't bathe. We don't need to [unintelligible]
Austin:        Not shower, right?
Ali:        Oh, he was one of those?
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        Yeah, he was one of those.
Art:        Celebrity no-bathers was a...
Ali:        Oh.
Art:        What a weird couple years we've had.
Austin:        Yeah. It's true. Anyway. All right.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        Does anybody want to do anything before the race kicks off? Is there anything else you want to establish, or anything you want to investigate, or do? Do you want to like, sabotage the competition, or anything else? Or should we just jump into this race, to kick things off?
Art:        I think I want to be focused on sabotage prevention, now that you've...
Austin:        I see.
Art:        [chuckling] Brought it up as a possibility. I'd rather not be sabotaged than sabotage someone else.
Austin:        Fair enough. Ali? Sylvi?
Sylvi:        Yeah, I'm ready to go.
Austin:        [unintelligible] ready to race.
Ali:        I'm trying to get this money, yeah, let's go.
Austin:        All right. Everyone — [chuckling] The Chicago Bulls entrance music plays —
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Everyone makes their way out to the, the track. It is now racing mode. We are out of story mode, you know, for as much as we were in it a moment ago. Racing mode is the kind of unique thing that's in this game, and it has two phases. It has the helicam phase and the maneuvers phase. The helicam phase is effectively like the montage of what's happening in the lap. And then the maneuvers phase is the zoom-in to see what happens at the, the kind of dramatic moment, uh, in the, in the lap at the, you know, when the camera zooms in on you.
1:10:18.2        There are three laps per race, uh, and, quote, a turn in Gravity Rip corresponds to a lap, uh, uh, with each standard race featuring 3 laps. Each turn features those two phases I talked about. When a racer begins their second lap, you can start overclocking, which is when you spend integrity for, uh, in exchange for better rolls, or bonuses on your rolls. Uh, every on-track encounter with a fellow Rip racer is a deadly battle of nerve and lightning reflexes. But with 20 competitors on the course, there's no time to describe every overtake and desperate sideswipe as you jostle your way through the pack. That's why a turn in Gravity Rip includes two phases. Helicam Phase is a helicopter montage that quickly sums up how all players fortunes shift over the course of an entire lap, before zooming into the cockpit for the maneuvers phase, gritty and often painful one on one battles of the climax of that lap. Each phase offers its own moves for racers to attempt, requiring both player and GMs to roll dice.
1:11:19.0        Uh, on the starting grid, a standard league race features 20 competitors. To keep races enjoyably brutal and chaotic for the billions of paying spectators, Rip league rules state that positions on the starting grid are assigned randomly via lottery at the beginning of each race. Uh, in addition, external comms with the cockpit are limited to the following items. One, a readout that shows the positions of all competitors in the racing pack, and two, a radio link that allows communication with teammates. The GM will roll a D20 as many times as necessary to determine the starting positions of all players and rivals, with grid positions established as the starting lights begin their countdown. As the pack roars away from the start line, the race begins proper.
1:12:00.4        So, we've got to roll some D20s. I think y'all should roll your own D20s, IMO.
Sylvi:        Okay.
Austin:        Uh, and that'll determine your — so Sylvi, you got an 8. Ali, you got a 13.
Art:        I don't even know how D20s work anymore. Uh...
Austin:        It's a 20-sided car —
Sylvi:        Oh!
Art:        Uh-oh.
Sylvi:        That's one of the other racers, is the 20-sided car.
Austin:        Ooh.
Sylvi:        It just tumbles around everywhere.
Ali:        [giggling]
Art:        It's a 20-sided car...
Austin:        It tumbles around. You've got to, we've got to — so what have we got to do — hm, we've got a tie.
Ali:        Tiebreaker roll?
Art:        I think it's —
Sylvi:        We can roll, we can roll again.
Austin:        Yeah, but, but, that second one... I guess, roll again. You should each roll again, and we'll take...
Art:        Is it high roll or low roll, gets 8, and the other one will get 9?
Austin:        Yeah. Let's go high roll, let's roll against each other for — actually, wait wait wait.
Art:        On a D20 still?
Austin:        Do you want to talk out who gets which? Could you have decided this?
Sylvi:        Oh, that's like an in-character thing, that Wrench would absolutely offer to be back a space, for the person that is a more experienced racer. Like —
Sylvi (as Wrench):        Yeah, no, no, I'm good. You can be number 8. That's fine. I'll be right behind you.
Art (as Trip):        You don't have — we can — it's fine. You don't, we can, we can do this however. I mean, all right.
Austin:        Mechanically speaking, there's a good reason for her to be behind you, which is that the higher weight car is better at defending, in a sense. And so, being able to like, keep other people from passing could be a really good strategy for y'all.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        Uh, uh, I imagine also —
Ali:        For, for audience context, Sylvi and Art both rolled an 8.
Austin:        Yes. Yeah. Yes. Thank you. Sorry. Uh, so, I need, we need tokens for y'all. I need tokens for —
Ali:        Oh...
Austin:        We need, I need something that represents you. Can you each produce one, one token?
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Otherwise I'm just going to search wrench [chuckling] in the token list, and see what comes out.
Sylvi:        Oh, Jesus.
Austin:        Uh, that's no good.
Art:        How do you use the tokens?
Austin:        I just need an image, just give me an image. Put it in the Discord and I'll drag it — I guess I could use these cars, in retrospect, huh?
Art:        Yeah. Mm-hm.
Austin:        Let's do that, let's use these cars. Is that fine? Does anyone have a feeling that —
Sylvi:        I'm okay with using a car.
Austin:        That they'd rather not —
Ali:        Oh, I was picking something out for you, but —
Austin:        I mean, if you, if you have it in your heart, I think that that's acceptable. I would, I would accept this.
Ali:        [chuckling] Give me one, give me one second.
Austin:        Also, I'm going to say that this is not just — I don't like lottery. I think the lottery system is fine, but I'd rather this roll just represent like, your qualifying time, you know?
Art:        Wait, games, hyphen, icons? Dot net?
Austin:        Game, game hyphen icons dot net.
Art:        Game. There we go.
Austin:        Yeah, you should save that. That's, it's really useful. Because all of that stuff is, uh, —
Sylvi:        Open Source.
Austin:        I want to say — yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it's, you have to attribute, but that's it. You can share and copy, you can adapt and remix. I think you can do that, uh, uh, yeah, as long as you attribute. There's no other, uh, uh, restrictions. You can do commercial stuff with it. We use them all the time. Or, I use them all the time.
Art:        All right, how do I, how do I send this to you?
Austin:        Just put it in Discord, that's fine.
Art:        Right below the...
Austin:        Tony the Tiger, yeah.
Art:         Tony the Tiger there?
Austin:        Yeah, just.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        Yeah, please. Thanks.
Art:        All right.
Austin:        Great. Great Ali, incredible. Can you explain what I'm looking at here?
Ali:        [laughing] Uh, you are looking at a picture of the iconic San Rio character, Kiromi.
Austin:        Incredible. Beautiful, look at this. This person.
Ali:        He's doing a little wave, I think. [snorts]
Austin:        Doing a great little wave. Art?
Art:        Nope.
Austin:        Well, that didn't work.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        You went for the... speedometer.svg, huh?
Art:        Yep. I hit download on the thing, and then just put the file into Discord.
Austin:        Ah, uh-huh. I don't know why that didn't work, actually. Is this is the game icon speedometer? Oh, okay, I see it.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        Great. Gotcha. Save that, grab that, plop that on here. Uh, I'm going to just quickly clarify a rule, or a suggestion, let's see. Player arrival tracking card. Keep the grid out of view of your players. They'll be more than capable of visualizing their own place in the pack, and can always ask you if they need a reminder. Okay. Sure. You know what, I'm going to reveal it, because we're not, I'm not, I can't hide my — I guess I could hide my dice rolls, but I don't think I've ever hid dice rolls on roll20. I don't even know how I would do that. Uh, so. In this case, I'm just going to make all this stuff visible, instead of not visible. Uh... uh... Art, you are number, you are number 8, right? And Sylvi, I'm just going to use your car —
Sylvi:        Yeah, sure.
Austin:        Is that, is that right? So you were in —
Sylvi:        Yeah, I was 9th.
Austin:        9th, right? You rolled a 9? Was that right? Okay. And then — all right, so this is for Tate. Oh my god. Tate rolled an 8.
Ali:        [laughing] Oh my god.
Austin:        That's, like, honestly kind of... impressive, right? Uh, it's weird that it doesn't say what to do.
Art:        Pretty unlikely.
Austin:        Yeah. I'm going to, I'm going to reroll, uh, I guess, I guess, now the three of us should roll. Uh, again, just to see who wins, and who goes where.
Ali:        No, just do a roll of 1D2, and then if it's 1, you're 7, and if it's 2, you're 10.
Austin:        I like that, that's a good idea. 7. So there's Tate.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        And here is... SC. Uh... sorry, yeah here is, here — actually, wait, did I get their stats wrong? One second. I have to make sure these stats are correct. I got these stats wrong. Phew. Important. Important catch. Or, I got their coloring wrong, one second. SC is in the green, obviously.
Ali:        Duh.
Austin:        So this is SC. Unbelievable. All right, doing the same thing. This is a really tight middle pack.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        I rolled a 9 for, for SC. 1 will be 6, and 2 will be 10. It's 1. Damn.
Ali:        Jesus.
Austin:        Uh, boom. Then I have to roll for Baby.
Ali:        This is...
Austin:        God. I got another 8.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        Wow.
Austin:        1 will be 5, 2 will be 10.
Ali:        [snorts]
Austin:        All right, that's a 10.
Art:        I think we're coming up with a problem with their random-assigned grid system here in the game.
Austin:        Uh, here is, uh... Absolute Pluperfect.
Ali:        Wow.
Austin:        That's a 2. That's appropriate, honestly, isn't it? In some ways, given what I said about, about them being like a super pro, you know?
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Uh, and —
Sylvi:        Jesus Christ.
Austin:        And then Sonny, sorry, Fastos.
Ali:        Wait, can you erase over the twin — [cackling]
Austin:        No. I can't. I can't — I'm not doing that work.
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:        If you want to find me a photo of one of the twins, one of the Matrix twins —
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        I will sub it out. But I can't. I can't find a photo of only one of them, that's not how they... there's one, I guess, here, getting punched in the stomach, but...
Ali:        [giggling] It's okay.
Austin:        Anyway, here's Fastos. Fastos is 6, which means I have to roll a 1D2. 1 will be 5, 2 will be 11. Uh... 1 will be 5. Damn. All right, Fastos. You doing it. Uh...
1:20:03.3        It's Chris Penn, who was Sonny in our very first Bluff City game. Looks like his great-graph. I mean, it was either that, or it would be Phastos from the Eternals, and that feels wrong, you know?
Ali:        [chuckling] I didn't find one of the twins, but then I did find this promotional picture for, uh, Matrix [unintelligible]
Austin:        I will not add — I will, okay.
Ali:        Don't switch it out, I just wanted to share it with the class.
Austin:        Are you sure? Are you sure you don't want me to — [laughing]
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Because this is the worst thing I've ever seen. It's so bad. It's like [chuckling] upsettingly bad.
Ali:        Yeah... [wheezes]
Austin:        Uh, I guess I could take a — I could do a —
Ali:        No, no, no, it's [giggling] no, no, no.
Austin:        You sure? Are you sure you're okay with this? Okay.
Ali:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Austin:        If you promise.
Ali:        I, yeah. I do.
Sylvi:        Oh, that's horrible to look at, wow.
Austin:        It's really rough. It's really rough.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        All right. We have done our opening D20 rolls. As a, as a way of setting this up, there are other people in these, in these other positions. I have their names and stuff, but I'm not going to roll for them. It'll come up as, as necessary. The rivals you need to care about, and you, are in the following positions. Absolute Pluperfect is in second place, starting out. Uh, uh, Fastos, Sonny veranda the third, is in fifth place. Uh, uh, Baby is — sorry, I guess it goes this way next.
1:21:24.6        SC, uh, is in, uh, the, the, uh, the Tiger Bite green.
Art:        The sour cream and onion.
Austin:        The sour cream and onion, SC, yeah, uh-huh. Is in sixth place. Tate is in, uh, seventh place. Uh, Trip is in, uh, what is this? Five, six, seven, eighth place. Uh, Wrench is in ninth place. Baby is in tenth place. And bringing up the rear, I mean, no, because you're still not in twentieth place, obviously. Uh, but Froggy, you are in, uh, uh, 13th place.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        So... let me come back over to the book here. With grid positions established, the starting lights begin their countdown. As the pack roars away from the starting line, the race begins proper. In my mind, this is a track, uh, that exists out over the ocean. It's like, hovering, or it's like a combination of hover track and then like, those huge, tall columns holding up parts of the track, that is like, you know, up 100s of feet in the air, basically. Uh, and there are all sorts of drone cameras flying around, and the waves are crashing below, and... is this daytime, or nighttime? What time of the day is it that we're racing? Anyone have strong feelings for this charity event race?
1:22:50.4        
Art:        I mean, I feel like most races are in the daytime, but like, night is certainly like a cooler aesthetic.
Austin:        Do we want to save night?
Art:        Although [unintelligible] need a lot of, need a lot of signage, you know?
Austin:        Yeah, it feels dangerous. I mean, this is a dangerous sport, so...
Art:        It can all be in your HUD, right? Your, your, your car could —
Austin:        Right, right.
Art:        Know to show you what the track is.
Austin:        That's true, that's true. Uh, yeah, let's just say, let's just say it's, uh, let's just say it's... day. For the sake of it, and let's save night for a future race. That seems fun. So, middle of the afternoon here. Uh, there, there is like a section of, of track that has stands built into it, that you have to like, get flown out to, in, in, either in your private, you know, flying hover car, or in big, you know, fan buses. Lots of tourists, uh, come here.
1:23:44.3        This is like, this is the sort of event that, I guess just to give a little bit of background on what's happening in Atlantic City, which is that, like I said before, it's in a bad way. But part of the way that they've tried to quote/unquote reinvest in the city was by reinvesting in casinos and gambling, and kind of the classic cyberpunk, like, anything you want, you can get in this city, thing. And so you have people coming here from Bluff, uh, uh, you know, to spend money illicitly. Uh, and as part of that, you have the illegal race scene, but you also have things like this, which are like, people are showing up in their finest, you know, they're, they're out here really trying to look their best. Lots of fur, lots of, uh, you know, fancy jewelry. Lots of like, next-wave, you know, uh, fashion, this kind of like, absolutely on the edges of, of what's happening right now. And also, we're also in the future already, so it's like the future of the future type stuff.
1:24:41.4        Uh, and so, so that's like, what the vibe is like, in terms of who is in, in part of the stands. Uh, and then I imagine, probably in the stands in general, and it's much more like, private boxes, right? And then I imagine that people who watch this stuff, who are from the city for real, who are like, the people who are below the fog line, or the smog line, are like, uh, watching on TVs, huddled around, you know, the local, the local bar or whatever. Uh, uh, I think that, in general, you're probably well-liked by the people here, because, you know, uh, Froggy, and it sounds like, Wrench are locals. I don't know, Trip, are you from here originally? Or did you move here?
1:25:24.0        
Art:        I think from out of town.
Austin:        Out of town, okay, sure. Uh, Trip, you know what? [chuckling] Trip has a real Blue City vibe to me, for some reason. Uh, so, yeah. So, so things are getting ready to go, and, uh, we get our great, you know [counting down] beep, beep, beep... boop! And everyone takes off.
1:25:44.4        Uh, with the race underway, the GM will ask the players what their goal is for this lap, starting with the player highest in the pack. And then, in descending order, will you try to advance, push ahead through the pack, retreat, drop back into a lower position, or hold your place? Remember that while position in the podium is a delicious treat, your primary goal is to meet the objective, and this might not necessarily be compatible with you gunning straight for first place. When the GM asks what you'd like to do, tell them whether you'd like to advance, retreat, or hold, and roll dice to see how your lap pans out.
1:26:13.6        When everyone's rolled, the GM will montage the lap, summing up the events of the contest, uh, with a brief and exciting description. Uh, note that in the helicam phase, players' moves won't become part of the fiction until every racer has rolled, including the GM-controlled rivals. Someone else's [unintelligible] roll could well impact your own slick attempt to dominate the track. Uh, I don't know if, and I'm going to quickly double-check, if rivals roll first or not, if they're ahead of you. Like, I don't know, do I go through, do we just go from one down? Let's see. Yes, your rivals are part of the turnover, too. Uh, so, this is pretty easy, I think.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        I think everyone, surprise, most people this turn are going to try to advance, right? Actually, maybe not everybody will. That's kind of interesting. Okay. So, uh, let's see here. Let's start with a very easy one. Uh, starting in second place, uh, again, I'm not going to describe what ends up happening. This is the interesting thing about this. Because it could get undone, right? But let's demonstrate an advance maneuver, because Absolute is, uh, uh, is absolutely going to try to advance into first place from second place. When you try to advance, roll a D6 and add your machine's acceleration modifier, plus any overclock you wish to add. More information on overclock below. The result is the number of places you can potentially move up in the thrilling montage. For example, if you start your lap in fifteenth place, and you roll a 4, and your machine has an can acceleration of 2, that means your driving over the course of the lap will be skillful enough to push ahead to ninth place.
1:27:59.2        A lap spend forcing your way past your opponents, and dodging whatever obstacles the track has to offer — tight bends, jumps, molten lava — will be full of perilous and potentially painful moments, however. After you roll to advance, the GM will roll a D6 for what is called the pushback roll, which generalizes how ferocious the competition is during the lap. If the result of the push back roll is higher than your result, you do not advance, and remain in the position you started the lap in.
1:28:24.9        Should another player or rival subsequently take your position, you are forced back one place. Uh, uh, if the result of the push back roll is equal to or lower than your result, you are free to advance. You must, however, make up the total, uh, of the push back roll by sacrificing integrity or positions gained, in any combination you choose. So, this is going to be an easy one, probably, Absolute Pluperfect, who was a very fast car, and also, uh, let's see here, I need to write down what their, what there are integrity is, also. One second. Okay. So, I'm going to roll for Absolute. It's a D6, plus Absolute's 3 in acceleration. Uh, really just, just like you, Trip, except successful. Uh, [chuckles] I said that, but got a 1. So I'll add that 1 from the roll to Absolute's 4, or rather 3 in acceleration to get a 4. And then I'm going to do this push back roll, which is another D6.
1:29:38.7        And that's a 3. Which means, uh, that it's lower, right? If the push back is equal for lower to, you're free to advance. You must, however, make up the total in integrity or positions gained, in any combination you choose. So, in this case, Absolute Pluperfect does pull ahead of Calista Lee, driving the Keen X1 but, takes some, takes some hits doing it. Callista does not give this up easily, and gets, gets some good hits in, on absolute, doing 3 points of, of integrity damage here to absolute. So that's, that's fun. Uh, or I guess, I shouldn't say that yet, right? Because it hasn't been locked in yet, uh, because other people still get to go. Like, for instance, our, our friend Fastos, Sonny Veranda the third, who is also going to roll to advance. Sonny has a... 1. Oh, boy. That's not a great roll. Rolled a 1, plus, plus his 1 in acceleration is only a 2. The push back roll is 2. I don't think Sonny's going to take any, is going to take the damage. Sonny is just going to like, roll with it. Uh... yeah. I think, sacrificing — mmm. You know what, moves up 1. Chooses to move up 1, and take a little damage, uh, in the, take 1 damage in the process, instead of moving up 2 and taking 2. So, there you go. Uh, and then, I think only SC, of the, of the Tiger Bite crew is going to try to advance here. So, same thing, rolling a D6 and adding to, uh, in this case a pretty bad acceleration. SC is not going anywhere. SC rolled a one and has a negative 1, so is not advancing at all. Do you still, I guess you don't need to do the push back roll at that point, because you can just, not advance. And then finally, of the NPCs, I guess given that Tate is also going to try to advance – Tate — I'm getting terrible rolls —
Sylvi:        Yeah, wow.
Austin:        It's all 1s and 2s out here for my NPCs. Zero acceleration on Tate, push back roll, only a 1.
Art:        We're going to be 1, 2, and 3 in this race.
Austin:        I — you might be. At this, at this rate? It's possible.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Uh, you can pass, huh. I have to, I need to look up something about teammates. I believe... can you just swap places with a teammate? I think you should be able to, right? That seems like it makes sense —
Ali:        This isn't...
Austin:        That seems like it makes sense.
Ali:        But there are other people in motion, right? Like, you can't just...
Austin:        Right. But I'm not saying advance past, but like — here's what I'm saying.
Ali:        Oh, I —
Austin:        Oh, right. Mmm, what are you going to —
Ali:        I think it makes sense in this case, because they're both on the same teammate, but if they were like, 6, 7, 8 —
Austin:        That's what I mean.
Ali:        And someone was in 7 —
Austin:        Absolutely not, yes, yes, yes, yes. I'm specifically talking about, because they are 6 and 7 —
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        I think that they can swap positions effectively here, right?
Ali:         Uh-huh.
Austin:        Without, without there being damage between the two, right? Like, likewise, Ali, if you rolled to pass Art here, if you rolled enough to move up by 1, and Art was like, yeah, go ahead, that would be — you wouldn't have to take damage in doing that, I'm guessing.
Ali:        That would be Sylvi.
Austin:        Or I guess, you know what? You know what? Oh, sorry, that's right, that's Sylvi. You're, sorry, you're back in 13th, my bad.
Ali:        [chuckles]
Austin:        I — you know what though? I'm wrong, because it says that, uh, that the push back roll is not just about other racers. It's also about things like jumps, and it's the track, also, right?
Ali:        Mmm.
Austin:        So, so — no, I think that that still does take one damage, uh, uh, I do think that, that Tate takes one damage here also. All right.
1:34:08.6         Trip, what are you doing? Are you advancing, are you holding, or are you retreating?
Art:        Advancing.
Austin:        I had a feeling. Give me a D6, plus your, uh, your acceleration, which is 3. Another 2.
Art:        5.
Austin:        So 5. I will then do the push back roll. Only a 2. So that means, you can move up, up to 5 spaces. Uh, uh, passing, uh, both SC and Tate, and — wait, one, two, three, four, and Sonny.
Art:        I get all the way up to 3, yeah.
Austin:        You get up to 3, but you would take 2 damage.
Art:        Uh...
Austin:        Again, I'll read that. If the result of the push back roll is higher than your result — that's not the case — if the result of the push back roll is equal to or lower than your result, you're free to advance. You must make up the total of the push back roll by sacrificing integrity, or positions gained in any combination you choose. So, for instance, so —
Art:        But if I move up 3, it's quote/unquote free, right?
Austin:        Uh... right. Correct. You won't take damage, right. Because you'll have sacrificed two spots.
Art:        Right. So I'll do that. I think — how many laps, did you say?
Austin:        Three laps. And starting next lap, you can start to overclock, hurting your car in favor of getting pluses to your rolls.
Art:        All right, I'm going to third.
Austin:        All right, going to third. Zip! So, take your 2 damage here, dropping your integrity from what? From 7 to 5. Yikes, okay. All right.
Art:        No one knows what that means.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Well, it doesn't — well, I guess we'll, we'll talk about what it means when these rolls are done and we'll be able to montage this a little bit.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        But no one knows if 5 is bad, we can't —
Austin:        We've just started this game.
Ali:        Zero is, you explode.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Art:        Yeah, 5 is way more than zero.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Zero is, you have to roll a die to see if your character dies.
Sylvi:        Yes.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Art:        I'll — I'll do a new character every race.
Austin:        [laughing] Yeah, this will quickly become the game about how Tate died tragically. Anyway, Wrench —
Art:        And then his cousin...
Austin:        Sorry, not Tate, Trip — Trip, Trip, yeah.
Art:        Marvin Berry, [laughing] comes —
Austin:        Tate is my guy. Uh, uh, Wrench, you are up. What are you doing? Are you advancing, are you holding, or are you retreating?
Sylvi:        I think I'm going to hold.
Austin:        Okay. So, holding, a different — I, I appreciate that you're doing the second thing here —
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        Because it helps us explain the rules. Opting to hold and defend your position, rather than advancing, is a useful skill, because it's a great way to halt the progress of any rivals who started the lap behind you — in this case, Baby. Holding your position in a pinballing mess of machines is no easy feat, however, requiring near-perfect situational awareness to prevent overtakes, while maintaining speed. Beyond this, you'll need to contend with the results of a push back roll, which generalizes how aggressively the machines behind try to smash through your defenses. To hold, roll a D6 plus your weight modifier, and any overclock you wish to add. We're still preoverclock, so you can't do that in this first roll, this first lap. So, go ahead and give me your D6 plus weight.
Sylvi:         Okay.
Austin:        Which is, 2, right?
Sylvi:        Yep. That's an 8.
Austin:        There's an 8. That's a perfect roll, goddamn. Uh, so that's, there's 8. If the result of the push back roll is equal or lower to your result, you successfully hold. The furious pack — oh, I'm sorry, I have to do the push back roll, right? But it will be lower, because it's only a D6.
Sylvi:        [chuckles]
Austin:        I did also [chuckles] roll a 6.
Sylvi:        [unintelligible]
Austin:        But it does not matter, uh... if the result of your push back roll is equal to or lower than your result, you successfully hold. The furious pack behind you is no match for your sublime domination of the course, and no competitors can penetrate your defenses. On a successful hold, no racers except teammates can get past you on this lap, and even teammates may only slip past at your discretion. So, you've completely blocked out Baby. Baby cannot advance past you in this case. I think that that's true. I believe that's true.
Sylvi:        I think that's what it says, is, uh, no racers can get past this lap unless racer allows them.
Austin:        Yeah. Which means that the... yeah, I'm just double-double-checking here. Yeah, if they — yeah, wow, completely blocked-out, incredible. Uh, then, uh, uh, you don't take any damages for the record, so you know. If you had failed that roll — not failed, but if the push back roll had been higher, uh, uh, it means that you would... failing to hold, da-da-da da. Uh...
1:39:04.6        Oh, it doesn't mean that you take any damage, even, it just means you don't get to do the thing that you just did, which is block it off, right? Failing to hold doesn't mean you'll definitely end up in this lap in a lower position, but it generalizes, over the course of the lap, you're not able to keep the racers who started behind you from slipping past. Should a player or rival's subsequent turn see them taking your position, you will be forced back. So like, you know, it just didn't work, right?
1:39:24.5        Uh, so, okay. That means that, in a weird — SC is then, sorry, Baby is in a weird place, because Baby can't advance past you. I guess Baby is going to try to hold also? That seems like it would make the most sense. Uh, so, despite not having a car built for that, Baby's, Baby's Tiger Bite Black is a fast car, but... uh, uh, so this is to hold. Uh, that's a bad roll for Baby. That's a 2, and the, the, uh, push back was only a 1. So, Baby does in fact manage to hold. Froggy, the highest you can get this turn is [chuckles] 11th place.
Ali:        Oh, okay.
Austin:        Because, Baby's blocked off 10th and above, in the same way that Wrench blocked off ninth and above. So — but it is now your turn, Froggy, what do you do? Are you advancing?
Ali:        Yeah. Uh —
Austin:        All right, give me a D6 plus your speed. Your acceleration, not your speed.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Not speed, acceleration. Different word.
Ali:        I just roll a 1D6 and then we add it though, right?
Austin:        1D6 and you add it, yeah, exactly.
Ali:        So that's a 4, which makes it a 6.
Austin:        With makes it a 6, which means you can get up to 11th. I guess I still have to do the —
Ali:        Push back.
Austin:        Push back, only a 3. Hey, that works out. You don't take any damage, at the very least, right? Because 6 minus three means that you can move up to 3 spots without taking any damage, but you can only move up 2 spots anyway, so —
Ali:        Okay, yeah.
Austin:        You slide past some people here. Uh, all right. I think that that is — and just for the record, the third thing you're allowed to do here is retreat. You can always retreat to any position you want by hitting the brakes or spinning the [chuckling] car around and driving in the opposite direction, or stopping. And there might be reasons you might want to do that. Like, if I said the objective was to knock a car off the course, right? That would be a thing that you would decide, like, oh, hey, I want to focus on that this, this race. And so, I need to back up to be close, right? So, keep that in mind for the future. Uh, all right, ending helicam phase. When all players and rivals have described their ambitions for the lap and rolled where necessary, the GM will deliver an exhilarating montage that sums up the events during the lap so far, before beginning the next phase, maneuvers. So, where we stand now, if I'm looking at this right, Absolute Pluperfect pulled in front of Callista Lee in the Keen X1 which, by my note, looks like a 1980s, uh, Japanese home computer. You know, like a, like an FM towns marty or one of the Sharpe X-1s, right? So that's, that's fun. The, the Pluperfect mobile, which looks just like, in my mind, the Absolute Class looks like, what if Darth Maul's ship from Episode One was smaller and could race on a track. So just this like, silver fucking dagger thing.
Ali:        [snorts]
Austin:        Uh...
Art:        I hear if you, uh, have a, have a controller plugged into the third port on the N64, uh, pod racing game —
Austin:        Yeah, uh-huh.
Art:        And that person holds up on the stick, and inputs a, a really long string of inputs, that you can actually as —
Austin:        You can just, it's just straight-up there.
Art:        Darth Maul and — yeah.
Austin:        Yeah, uh-huh, I gotcha. [chuckles] Uh, Trip, you and Fastos, AKA Sonny, AKA formerly known as Sonic, uh, really dueled all the way up the, the racetrack this, this, uh, this, uh, lap, or the first part of this lap, I guess. You know, the two of you were probably bumping against each other a lot, but also were just constantly overtaking everyone else. You, you went past Suzie Sezerach and her Ace Imperial Custom. You absolutely put Fortenbras, the Final Word, behind you. And now behind you is Sonny, and behind Sonny is Bret Nebraska, what pilots the White Albatross. And then in front of you is Callista Lee, and the Keen X-1 in second place. Uh, then, then who's next? I guess Tate and SC have kind of held it down here in the sixth and seventh positions, not moving too much, but being able to just kind of keep it, keeping protected. I imagine there's been a lot of... I wouldn't say, you know, I imagine they're acting the way, like, a heel tag team does, you know what I mean? Lots of dragging the opponent back to the corner, but for racing, you know what I mean? Lots of boxing people out. Any time someone tries to overtake one of them, the other one switches place with them, and like, puts a little bit of extra protection between the two of them. This is exactly what this team is meant to do, except that their big, speedy racer, Baby, is all the way back at 10th place, where Baby, he's not allowed, he can't move up, because Wrench has completely, completely, uh, uh, stopped him from moving in any way whatsoever. Wrench, in front of you is Fortinbras with The Final Word. Fortinbras, I imagine, is like, absolutely, what if a knight had a car.
1:44:44.7        What if a medieval knight —
Sylvi:        Oh my god.
Austin:        But also, like a medieval anime knight, so I imagine flowing, voluminous red hair, and, and also, uh, a car, a car that looked like a — I don't want to say looks like a horse. [chuckles] Because it doesn't have legs. But it has this, a sort of, you know, equine shape, generally. Let the fan artists figure out what the fuck that means. [laughing] What does a horse-shaped car — I don't know.
Ali:        Is it like a chariot situation?
Austin:        I guess, maybe it is like a chariot situation, that's fun. Uh, and then immediately behind baby, uh, is, is Froggy. You've, you've gone past Egon Benny, Egon “Eggs” Benny, and the Two-Top, which is like, what if a 1950s diner was a car.
Ali:        Okay.
Austin:        You know? It's like checkerboard, but also, the sort of like, speckled teal, you know? That vibe.
Ali:        Big leather seats.
Austin:        Big leather seats.
Ali:        It's like a booth seat.
Austin:        Just, it's roomy — yeah, uh-huh.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        You would think, if you had a race car, you wouldn't make it so roomy in there, but actually it's kind of comfortable.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Uh, so that is the state of the race as we move into the first maneuvers phase. It is now time to get down in the dust, in the exhaust fumes, zooming in to focus on individual machine on machine battles, starting with the player in the highest position when the helicam phase ends. When that maneuver is resolved, the camera jumps to the following player in the second-highest position and moves on in this fashion until all players or rivals have made a move. Uh, in the maneuvers phase, we zoom into the cockpit at the position your racer finds themselves in, as they scream towards the very end of the lap.
1:46:29.7        Most likely, they'll be faced with the racer ahead, eager to defend their position, and a racer behind, desperate to get past by any means. You can choose between three moves in this phase: attempt an overtake on the machine ahead, to make a damaging slam attack on the machine either ahead or behind, or to block the machine behind from passing you. Until this is the final lap, the GM will restate the positions of the players, and the helicam phase starts fresh with the next lap, beginning once more with the player or rival in the highest position. So we're going to start with, again, Absolute Pluperfect, who is just going to try to block. Uh, with your eyes glued to the rear mirror screen, attempt to anticipate and prevent a maneuver from behind. The competitor on your heels may try to overtake, or risk a more dangerous slam attack. The GM will warn you which of these moves you're defending against. In this case, uh, I think that Callista Lee in, in her car, whatever I said it was before, the Sharpe X-1, is going to try to reovertake, in this moment. So, that means Absolute has to roll weight, which is not what they're good at. They're going to have a minus one on that. So they only roll a 2 on that. Uh, your opponent also rolls a D6, plus their acceleration modifier. I guess in this, I'll — the rules say that I just spit ball what these, what this car has, because it's not a rival car. Uh, I think this is a fast car. A thing called the Sharpe X-1 feels fast, right?
Sylvi:        Yeah. That's a pretty fast name.
Austin:        I'm going to say it's a plus, I'm going to say it's a plus 2 on acceleration and a 0 on weight. Roll that. Wow, 4. So she beats him, there, on that, on that attempt. If you attempted to block, ba ba ba ba ba. So that's, so it does not manage to actually get overtaken, but also has not successfully blocked here, I guess. I thought there was a special rule for defending from the front, but I can't find it.
Art:        Oh, uh...
Austin:        It's in there somewhere, right?
Art:        It's further up. It's not, it's for the helicam, it's not for the maneuvers.
Austin:        Oh, it's not for the maneuvers phase, I gotcha. Okay, that's why.
Art:        It's, you can hold with acceleration —
Austin:        Right, okay. Gotcha. Uh, all right. So, ahead of you, that means, Trip, you can see Callista and Absolute Perfect vying for position. But Absolute's holding on pretty well. Uh, what are you going to do in this moment? Are you going to try to overtake Callista? Are you going to try to slam, slam Callista? Are you going to try to block — I guess you could also try to Slam Sonny, or you could try to block Sonny from behind. Art?
Art:        Uh, I'm not actually good at any of these?
Austin:        [chuckles] You're not good at any of these?
Art:        I'm good at overtaking, but like —
Austin:        Okay.
Art:        We just established there's a good weight ahead of me.
Austin:        Yeah, but — no, no, we established there was a good speed in front of you.
Art:        Oh, wait — oh.
Austin:        They're both fast. Callista's a 2, and Absolute's a 3, on acceleration.
Art:        All right. I'll try to — hm. Or, I guess, it says that I can know what the person behind me is going to do?
Austin:        If you try to —
Art:        Yeah, if —
Austin:        If you try to block. If they're going to either try to —
Art:        If I were to block, I would be blocking against a slam, or a, or a —
Austin:        You would be, you'd be blocking against an accelerate here. I think, you know, Sonny's not trying to knock you off this course.
Art:        All right. Then I'll go for, uh, for an overtake.
Austin:        Okay. Uh, give me a — okay. Roll a D6.
Art:        D6.
Austin:        Plus your acceleration modifier. That's a 6. Plus a 3 —
Art:        That's a 9.
Austin:        That's a 9. Uh, I said Callista has a plus-zero, so you're going to win this, [laughing] but she does roll a 6. For the, let the record state —
Art:        [laughing]
Austin:        She did roll a 6. The highest result is successful. On a successful roll, you cruise past the racer ahead and take their place. Gain a position. On a failed roll, you attempt to pass, but are outmaneuvered. Having controlled the encounter, the machine in front can choose to make a free slam attempt. That does not happen. Instead, what, what happens. You tell me what happens here, visually, as you move ahead.
Art:        I think it's like, it's just like a deec. It's like, it looks like it's trying to pass on the right, and like, they overcommit on the slam, and it's like, pass on the left, you know?
Austin:        Yeah, yeah. Gotcha. Well, you know, that's going to, that puts Sonny right in a good position to try to overtake Callista also. Let's roll that, that's a 4, and Sonny has another number that I have to look up. Oh, has a 1. So that's a 5. Callista, again, will try to defend. Fails to defend, rolling a 3, and Sonny is right behind you, Trip, so it is Absolute Perfect in first, holding on, and then both you and Sonny slid right past Callista. I think, I think Sonny probably, probably like, used your little juke as a lead-in, you know?
Art:        Mmm.
Austin:        Uh, and maybe just drifted right behind you, you know? Just right on your tail. Uh... I think I'm going to just say that, uh, I guess I should roll for it. It's just so easy to fall into the trap of rolling non-stop, you know what I mean? Yeah. I'll roll for, I'm going to roll for Tate, at least, I think. And I think that, uh, SC is going to hold in place. But, but Tate going to try to move forward here. Tate, again, battling against Bret Nebraska, who I think has a big, heavy fucking car situation. So that's a 0/2 car. Uh... Tate only rolls a 3. Which is not great for Tate.
1:52:28.7        And then in response, yeah, no. Tate doesn't go anywhere, and neither does SC. SC is just, is just trying hold in place. I'm not going to bother rolling for SC against this NPC who is not even a rival. But, uh, if you want to try to maneuver up forward at this point, Wrench, you let me know if that's a thing you're doing. Or, are you going to try to hold — sorry, block or slam, uh, Baby?
Sylvi:        Uh, I think I'm going to block for now. I think that Wrench's whole thing is where she's like, I'm good here, I'm going to stay here —
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Sylvi:        I want to be safe.
Austin:        Yeah. Uh... and for what it's worth, Baby was definitely going to try to just overtake you. Uh, Baby has a fast car, not a tough, tough car. And so, uh, uh, I guess, go ahead and give me your block roll. D6 plus —
Sylvi:        It's a 5, that's all.
Austin:        Okay. And that means to counter this here, this is D6 plus acceleration, which is also a plus-2. Ooh, okay. So, uh, if you attempted to block... uh, I guess, does it just not work? I'm a little confused on how block works. Block seems like the default you're going to do if you're not moving up or trying to hurt somebody, right?
Sylvi:        I guess?
Ali:        Well, it seems to be based on what you're blocking. So is Tate overtaking, or slamming?
Austin:        Uh, Baby was overtaking.
Sylvi:        So I would lose one position.
Austin:        Does it say, where does it say that?
Sylvi:        Uh, if you look at the maneuvers phase thing down at the — underneath the cheat sheet, if, it's right next to —
Austin:        Oh, it does not — you know, it doesn't say that in the book.
Sylvi:        Oh. You
Austin:        I can't — it's really weird that this section does not say what happens if you fail this roll. But I am going to just default to what you just pointed out, which is, in the cheat sheet, it says, failure, overtake fails, opponent can attempt a free slam. Oh, sorry, I'm looking at wrong one. Sorry, right, right, failure against overtake, minus one position. So, yes. You try to block, it does not work, and Baby gets in front of you, which is a bummer.
Sylvi:        Okay.
Austin:        Uh, what, what happened there? Why did you, why did this not work out the way you [unintelligible] wanted?
Sylvi:        I think I'm just playing it too careful. Uh, I, like, I think maybe there's, we're getting close to like an edge of the track or something, and I had to slow down —
Austin:        Sure.
Sylvi:        While they just like, didn't worry about it at all. Uh...
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Sylvi:        Yeah. Something like that.
Austin:        Yeah. So that makes sense. Uh, all right. Well, we're back now, to... or, I guess — no. This still counted as the overtake, I think, right?
Ali:        Yeah, because the, the, the player behind you doesn't roll —
Austin:        The way it's written —
Ali:        Because their roll was the defensive against the block.
Austin:        Was this roll, yes. Okay. Yeah, that's, that's success or fail. So then, Froggy, it is your turn. Are you going to try to push up past your, your friend and teammate, Wrench?
Ali:        Uh, yeah, I think so. Yeah.
Austin:        Okay. I guess, I guess again, the question is, do you, can you just switch? I think we said yes, right?
Sylvi:        Yeah, I'm fine with it.
Austin:        Wrench, are you happy to let Froggy pass you here?
Sylvi:        [chuckles] Absolutely.
Austin:        What's the signaling look like for that?
Sylvi:        Didn't we say we had a way to —
Austin:        How do you communicate that to each other?
Sylvi:         Had a radio to communicate?
Ali:        Yeah, there's radios, right?
Austin:        Yeah, there's a radio. So what do you say, that's what I mean. What's the, what's the communication?
Ali (as Froggy):        Coming through. [laughing]
Sylvi:        Yeah, uh, —
Ali:        Beep-beep.
Austin:        Is that what Froggy says? Froggy says coming through, Ali?
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        Froggy says, “beep-beep,” and Wrench says, “beep-beep” back. There you go.
Ali:        [cackling] Yep.
Austin:        Now we're good. Yeah, see? Because, listen, other people are going to listen in to your radio, maybe. You don't know who's hacking in and listening to you guys — you gotta use codes.
Ali:        Oh, sure sure sure. I have a question, though.
Austin:        What were you going to say?
Ali:        Because going forward is sort of like a free move, if I successfully slam against somebody, do I...
Austin:        What do you mean, going forward is a free move?
Ali:        Well, like, I, I'm passing Wrench, but that's not like, I don't have to overtake to pass Wrench, right?
Austin:        Mmm... I think that's still the thing that's happen in this few seconds of play.
Ali:        Okay, sure sure sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Austin:        You know what I mean?
Ali:        So I'm not rolling in that case, is what you mean.
Austin:        You're not rolling, no, no, no. I'm just saying, you're good, you can just move forward. The two of you are tagging out in this, in this — because, this is not [sighs]this is about a specific instance, versus the sort of more abstract helicam phase, where it's about, can you also overcome the track itself? You know? Where you'd have to roll against the track, and not just your opponents. In any case, that is the, that is our first lap, first three. Uh, lap 2 starts back at the top, and we are at, we are at [sucks air] we are at the top of the, the chart here, with Absolute and then Trip, then Sonny, then Tate and SC, then Baby, then Froggy, and then, coming in at 13th place, at the back of, I guess the middle of the pack technically, is Wrench. Uh, uh, let's think about what we all want to do.
1:57:37.3        I think it's obvious, again, that Absolute is going to use that special rule that says, when you're in first place, you can try to hold simply by, uh, uh, using your speed, instead of using your, your, uh, weight. So in this case, easy to roll that. Only rolls a 1, but plus a 3 is still a 4. Which means... uh, I swear I'm going to learn these rules. I should be looking at this cheat sheet that's in front of me, instead of the book, is what I should be doing, huh?
Ali:        It's very easy.
Austin:        Yeah, it is. I've got it right here.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        So there's a 3. So that is a success. No racers can get past this lap, unless the racer allows them. So you're not going to be able to pass Absolute Pluperfect on this phase, Trip. But it is your turn. What are you, what are you doing? Given that.
Art:        Uh, then I guess I have to hold?
Austin:        That makes sense, yeah. So D6 plus weight.
Art:        But I'm bad at that.
Austin:        Yeah, well?
Art:        Uh... 5.
Austin:        That's not bad, that's not too bad.
Art:        It's not bad.
Austin:        And that's against a 3, so that's a success. No one can get past you. Uh, unless you allow it. Which means that Sonny is similarly going to try to, uh, hold onto this position. Uh, rolling a plus-1. Only a 2. Uh-oh. Sonny did not succeed at holding, uh, uh, and so, I guess we'll see, if anybody else can beat Sonny here. Like, for instance, Tate, who again, is going to try to advance. Tate only guess a plus-0, but... that's a 2. Ooh, ooh, ooh! But, I think, it's the middle of the race, it's time to take those hits, you know? I rolled a 6 on the, on the, uh, the uh, push back roll here, and a 2 on the advance. Uh, that's an expensive, that's so expensive to take that.
1:59:47.2        But I think —
Art:        You have to take, you'd have to take 6 integrity, right?
Austin:        To go up — [chuckles] 6 integrity to go up 2 spots? Yeah.
Art:        2 spots?
Austin:        Right?
Ali:        It's 2 and 2.
Austin:        I guess it — no, because the push back is 6, right?
Art:        You have to hit, you have to, you have to like, trade...
Ali:        Yeah, I thought it's, you can, you can advance none, and take none.
Austin:        Oh, because you failed, because you straight-up —
Ali:        And then [unintelligible] against 1, and take 1. Is that not how that works? Or would it be...
Austin:        We haven't seen a fail —
Art:        Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. If the result of the push back is higher than your result, you do not advance —
Austin:        At all.
Art:        Past the position you started —
Austin:        Yeah. So in fact, Tate does not move at all here.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        Because that was a failed roll, because the push back was higher. So it's straight up nothing.
Art:        Yeah. It's not, take 8 damage — [laughing]
Austin:        [laughing]
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Right, okay.
Art:        Or whatever.
Austin:        Uh, well, I guess here's the thing is, I guess maybe seeing this, SC, who does not have a fast car, uh, is going to, is going to boost, is going to do overclocking. We haven't seen overclocking yet. Uh, uh, overclocking is when you actively spend integrity to get a boost on your roll, basically. Uh, they're in here somewhere. Where are those overclocking rules, oh my god. Is it just down here? Overclock unlocks on lap 2. Sacrifice integrity points and add this number to the roll. Must be decided before the player rolls.
2:01:06.9        SC is going to sacrifice 3 integrity points, immediately dropping them by 3, in order to add 3 to this roll. That is a minus one roll, so it's — I'm going to roll a plus-2. Oof. It's a 4. Let's see what that push back looks like. Oh, brutal! Got a 5 on the push back, which means, I think, I think, just to narrate a little bit here, even though where not supposed to until the end where I do a big fly-through or whatever, I think that we see SC, who, again, is calm and collected normally, take a bunch of big swings, deploys wings on the, the Tiger Bite Green at one point, and tries to hit a ramp and go, like, skip part of the course, skip part of the track, and just comes in hard, uh, on, on the nose of the car, and it gets all dented up, and it does not get to advance at all. Bummer. And then Baby goes, and Baby... Baby's fast and Baby wants to go, Baby wants to go fast. Baby is fast, and Baby wants to go fast. Baby's also going to overclock by 2, taking a little bit of damage, and is going to roll a D6, plus 4. So 2 from the overclock, plus the 2 from the regular, just how fast, uh, uh, Baby's car is, and that's a 7, which is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, that can go all the way up to right behind you, Trip. Uh, and only a 3 on the, on the push back roll. I think it's going to take it. This is how Baby does. Baby is going to spend that integrity, and go up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I guess only 6 spots, because you held, right, Art?
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        Cannot displace you, but was able to move Sonny back one, which means, only has to take 2, or, no, has to take all three, right? Is that correct? Uh, ba ba ba ba ba. Yeah, sacrifice any combination — oh, no, I guess you, I guess, then, he sacrificed one slot, technically, even though you're holding it —
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        And so, he gets back one of those — not gets back, but... is, is not as, not as damaged, not 3 extra damage on top, just 2 extra damage. Okay, Froggy, you are up. And the field ahead is totally flexible. No one held in front of you. Everyone was trying to move forward, and they all fucked up. So it's all you.
Ali:        Yeah, let's try to advance. I think that I'm going to overclock a little bit and add... ooh...
Austin:        Hell yeah.
Ali:        I think I'm going to add one to my acceleration. Bringing my —
Austin:        Okay.
Ali:        Integrity from an 8 to a 7, and then my —
Austin:        Okay. And then your integrity down by 1, to 9? Is that right? No, that's Wrench's, shit, sorry.
Ali:         Yeah, so my integrity went from 8 to 7, and my acceleration is going from 2 to 3.
Austin:        Gotcha. All right, so just go ahead and give me a, give me a plus-3.
Ali:        Uh, roll —
Austin:        It's only for this roll. So you don't need to —
Ali:        Okay, [laughing] sure.
Austin:        You know?
Ali:        Just to know.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        Uh, 1D6 plus 2 is a — Jesus Christ, is a 3.
Austin:        No, it's plus-3, isn't it?
Ali:        Oh, plus-3. Okay. So that's a 4.
Austin:        Yeah, so far. That's not too bad. Okay, push back roll. Ugh...
Ali:        Uh, fucking...
Austin:        Oh, that's a 5. Unfortunate. Unfortunate, you don't go anywhere here.
2:04:43.1        Uh, what happens? What is your, what is, what happens to you in this moment that, that keeps you from being able to move forward in the pack?
Ali:        Uh, I guess it's just like a hard, this is like a hard section of the... the race, right? Where it's like, maybe the like —
Austin:        Yeah.
Ali:        Something that happens with like, racetracks sometimes is that if they're too wet or too warm or whatever, it makes the turns more risky.
Austin:        Mmm, mm-hm.
Ali:        So with like, everybody trying to accelerate and nobody really getting anywhere, I think it's like a traversal sort of like, it's difficult in this section, so everybody's getting kind of like, tripped up.
Austin:        Yeah, I like that. And, and in a way, that means that everyone's driving a little bit more defensively, and it's making it a pain in the ass to kind of keep, keep things going. All right. Uh, Wrench, what's the play?
Sylvi:         Uh, I feel like I'm going to try and advance this time.
Austin:        Okay.
Sylvi:        Uh, so that's just a flat D6.
Austin:        Give me your — flat D6. Unless you want to overclock.
Sylvi:        No, not yet.
Austin:        Which, which is interesting, because like, you're in a better position to overclock in some ways, because of having more integrity.
Sylvi:        Yeah, and that's just like, one point per, one point of integrity per —
Austin:        One point per, yeah.
Sylvi:        Okay.
Austin:        Good to know.
Sylvi:        Yeah... I just, you've been rolling a lot of high numbers for the push back, so —
Austin:        Also, reminder —
Sylvi:        I'm a little, a little squeamish at the moment.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        It's you true. Also, people should remember, they have a radical potent that they can spend, which lets you roll twice instead of once, and you can choose to do that after a bad roll, for instance, to be like, actually I want to reroll that. So keep that in mind.
Sylvi:        Okay.
Austin:        Maybe that's a lap-3 things.
Sylvi:        Nope, it's a right now thing, because I rolled a 1.
Austin:        Oh, [laughing] all right, so you're going to spend that, immediately?
Sylvi:        Yeah. Uh-huh. [chuckling]
Austin:        Sure, okay.
Sylvi:        I... [laughing] yeah, fuck it. That's a 3.
Austin:        That's a 3. Well, here comes push back.
Sylvi:        Fucking hell! [laughing]
Austin:        It's a D6, it's a 6. On a D6. These high numbers are just brutal. Uh, yeah, the, the you tell me, again, what happens here? Is there something specific that fucks you up here and prevents you from, even though you dug a little bit deeper, and spent your radical bonus?
Sylvi:        Uh, I think it's because she dug too deep, like, I think that she pushed this car a little bit too much for what it's able to do, like, in terms of like, accelerating quickly.
Austin:        Is it —
Sylvi:        Like, I think it like, blows out a little bit, and that's why she takes so much integrity damage.
Austin:        Oh... do you, do you — well, you didn't, you didn't take any integrity damage, thankfully.
Sylvi:        Oh, okay.
Austin:        Because you just failed this roll, so you just don't get to move forward, right? Uh, uh, I believe that that's — unless, again, I misunderstood this rule —
Sylvi:        No, I think I'm misreading the — I misread the success on, I misread the slam thing with the 1D6 additional damage.
2:07:38.0        
Austin:        Mmm. Gotcha, gotcha gotcha gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. You would just be forced back a place if someone tried to overtake you here, but you're good, in terms of damage. But I do think that that's like, it makes that sound, and, uh, what's the sound the car makes when it wants you to be more careful with it?
Sylvi:        I don't know what sounds cars make!
Austin:        Just make one up, it's the future.
Sylvi:        Oh, boy. [wheezes]
Austin:        It's a future car. Is it like a whir, is it like a boom, is it like a —
Sylvi:        Yeah, I think it's like a, it's like a —
Austin:        Bleep-bloop... does your car have a computer that talks to you in bleep-bloops?
2:08:10.5        
Sylvi:        You know what? I want, yes, it does. Because that brings the whole, referring to the car with a name thing —
Austin:        [intoning] Bleep-blooooo...
Sylvi:        A little bit weirder. [chuckles]
Austin:        Yeah. Yeah. Well, it does a little chirp at you. [intones] Bleep-bloop-blooo. And it's like, oh, no, you hit something bad there, you like —
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        You tried to shift from one gear to another a little too quick, and it didn't hit right, and like, ah, uh-oh.
Sylvi:        Yeah. If we can hear each other just like, talking over the radio whenever we speak, you can just, Wrench is just really, like, saying sorry over and over again to her car.
Ali:        Aw...
Austin:        [chuckles] Oh my god. Oh, buddy. All right. Uh, you know, I feel like we have a pretty good idea of what happened that lap. I get why the rules are about like, narrating the end of a lap instead of in the middle. But we have a really linear set of events that happened here, right? Absolute Pluperfect held on, while Trip and, at first I guess Sonny moved up. But, after Sonny drifted behind you, Baby definitely just found an opening and kind of just drilled through the, everyone, you know, around, uh, around him. Uh, I think maybe Baby hit the jump that SC went for and actually nailed it. Like, came in smooth, the, the Tiger Bite Black deployed the wings that look like the fucking, the bat wing, for a second, the — was that what the bat plane is called? Was it that the bat wing, is that right? Was it just called the Bat plane?
Art:        Uh, it depends. The bat wing is technically something different, but they're all things you would recognize as a bat plane.
Austin:        What the fuck's the bat wing? I searched for bat wing, what the fuck did I think I was going to get... bat wings.
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Anyway, it does that hit. Actually, you know what it probably looks like? [chuckles] It probably looks like Noxus's car from —
Sylvi:        [chuckles]
Austin:         Final Fantasy XV —
Ali:        Wow.
Austin:        That gets wings. I don't know if you've seen this, the car gets wings at a certain point. Uh... it, it looks very goofy. Uh, but it's kind of sick. Honestly, it's kind of sick. That feels, this feels like it's of this game we're playing, right? Uh, in fact, maybe that's the thing, is like, Baby like, completely lands right in front of Sonny, in a way that was almost dangerous, like... slams down the rear of, of the Tiger Bite Black, almost crushes the front of, [laughing] of Sonny's Medium Pizza Half Off At the Upper Crust, uh, causing some damage there.
2:10:45.9        Uh, uh, and there's a little bit of, it's heating up between the two of them, in terms of rivalry. And then, and then, you know, all the way back here, uh, uh, Froggy and, and Wrench, uh, you're doing your best, but Fortinbras, and the car that looks like a horse or a chariot or something is really holding on in front of you. It's all those horses, I think. It makes it hard to pass.
Art:        [chuckles]
Austin:        You know? Anyway, it's the maneuvers phase. Again, Absolute Pluperfect is just going to try to hold on and block, and block you out. I guess, what are you trying to do, Art? Since you're behind Absolute.
Art:        Uh...
Austin:        Overtake, presumably, right? Or, or slam, I guess.
Art:        Yeah, overtake, right? No, it's not that.
Austin:        Or you could be trying to block yourself, in which case, I don't know what happens. I guess, I guess you don't get to choose that. I think that's part of what block does, is block forces you into not blocking? That's a weird thing, huh. Yeah. You know, game rules. Anyway, what are you — you're trying to overtake, right?
Art:        I'll try to overtake.
Austin:        Already, so then I guess this will be rolling D — this is, this is a rough roll for...
Art:        Yeah, there's a part of me that wants to block, because what I really want to do is overtake at the very end.
Austin:        Right, of course, of course.
Art:        But I don't want to get too far, but if I get too far back, if I block and fail, and then the, there's a successful hold ahead of me, I won't be able to do it, you know?
Austin:        Right, right. Can you not, can you overclock in this phase? Why do I not see that here?
Ali:        Uh, it just says that it unlocks in lap 2, so you assume you can use it the rest of the race.
Austin:        I — you must be able to use it in this part of the race too, right?
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        You must be able to use it in the, in the maneuvers phase. Yeah, okay, you can. So I think we're going to have, Absolute is going to overclock by 2 here. Uh...
Art:        Wait, I don't think I should overtake, I think I should block.
Austin:        But that's not an option, this is what I'm saying about block. Block is forcing you —
Art:        Oh, so they're going to block before...
Austin:        They go first, they're in first place.
Art:        Oh.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Art:        So if they attempt to block —
Austin:        It doesn't say what happens when a rival is doing it, you know what I mean?
Art:        Yeah, if you attempt to block [unintelligible] oh, and they can force me out of blocking. Because, if they successfully block my, my move —
Austin:        That's what I'm saying, yeah, that's what I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely, yeah.
Art:        Mmm, that's weird.
Austin:        Uh-huh. [chuckles]
Art:        This is a little, this is a little weird. All right, so I guess, yeah. If they, if they block, I don't... on a successful, if you [unintelligible] or another player, they lose their turn. So I lose my turn no matter what.
Austin:        But you're, but this is your turn, effectively, right? You're —
Art:        Right.
Austin:        If you manage to overtake here, you overtake and move into first place.
Art:        So it's exactly the same as if I had — so this is just them forcing me to roll an overtake.
Austin:        Exactly, exactly. Or a slam, I guess. But...
Art:        Uh, but I guess... but I guess I can sacrifice a position, in my maneuvers phase. So I could overtake. And then just immediately —
Austin:        Oh, you could [wheezes]
Art:        [laughing] Drop back.
Austin:        Why would you do that? I guess because you want to pass, and the, you want to go — I see what you're saying.
Art:        Right, I don't think that I can successfully block in the last phase.
Austin:        Right. You still have a lot of integrity, remember? You can just burn it, you know what I mean?
Art:        Yeah, I guess. I just got to, uh...
Austin:        So...
Art:        If a successful block... you can make a free slam. Okay. All right. So I, I just roll acceleration.
Austin:        Yeah. And, uh, uh...
Art:        Oh, but they go first, right?
Austin:        They are, they are, they are rolling first, and they are rolling a plus, I guess I said they burned 2 integrity? Uh, I think that that's correct. They're going to burn that 2, which is still rough, because that means they can get a... Blocking is weight, and they're not good at weight. So even though they're burning 2, they're only going to get a plus-1 here. That's a 5. So you need to beat 5.
Art:        All right. With, with a plus-3.
Austin:        With a plus-3.
Art:        So I am not... what happens if it's a tie?
Austin:         Tie... depends. [chuckles]
Art:        The highest result is successful.
Austin:        Uh, there's a whole thing on ties here, there's a whole thing on ties in here, for sure.
Art:        Okay.
Austin:        Uh, and it depends on the thing, if I remember correctly. It's like, ties go to the person, here it is. Uh, uh, in the case of overtake and block, the result of a tie is that the machine in the higher position wins, whereas in a slam, the attacking machine wins. So in this case, a tie would go to them.
Art:        So I would lose a tie. But I don't know, I still have [unintelligible]
Austin:        Yeah, you, right, you want to be in this position, right? So...
Art:        But that's an 8.
Austin:        But that is an 8, so you overtake. What does it look like, Art?
Art:        Uh, I think I want to like narrate the, the caution, right? Like, this is, this is a plan, you know? I'm trying to draft, you know?
Austin:        Right.
Art:        If, if anyone listening doesn't know, drafting is the race thing where you sort of like are use the fact that the car in front of you is like, breaking the wind?
Austin:        Right.
Art:        And so you like, stay in this little pocket and you start to get this like, suction effect.
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        And I'm trying it, and they like, try to stop it, and it's like, it ends up being like, a sort of like, they try to like, get to the side to slow me down —
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Art:        But instead, it like, has the slingshot effect anyway.
Austin:        Right.
Art:        It's like, but it's like an unintentional pass. You know?
Austin:        Right. That makes sense.
Art:        They fucked up the —
Austin:        They fucked up here, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, I think that they give you a look here.
Art:        They're just... mad.
Austin:        [chuckles] Uh, and Baby's just going to try to ride on past that, doing the same thing, trying to overtake at this point, Absolute Pluperfect, but only getting a 3. I mean, that's still not great, because Pluperfect only has that, it's a minus-1 in weight. Uh, I think Pluperfect's just not going to overclock again, given how few... points they have left in integrity. Which is, they have a bonus on integrity, by the way, that nobody else has. It's worth saying that, because of being rich. Oh, but they still... what's, what do they just say? Tie goes to defender, right?
Art:        Uh, tie goes to —
Austin:        Or no, tie goes to overtaker in this case, right?
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        Uh, — no, the machine in the higher position wins.
Art:        Right.
Austin:        So in this case, Pluperfect holds on here, which, rip to Baby. In fact, maybe actually RIP to Baby, because Sonny is mad. Sonny is mad about that jump that just happened, and almost, uh, damaged the Honda Civic with the pizza drawn all over it. Uh, so, Sonny's going to do a slam. We haven't seen a slam before. Slam is, force the full weight of your machine into an opponent, targeting weak spots or bouncing them into the hard light holorails that border the track, inflicting catastrophic damage.
2:18:06.0        You can target a slam attack at the machine ahead or behind you. When attempting a slam, roll D6 plus your machine's weight modifier. The opponent rolls D6 plus their weight modifier, must bring all of their craft's defensive prowess to deflect or evade the attack. The highest result is successful. On a successful roll — I guess we'll roll and see what happens here. Uh, uh, Sonny has a plus-1, and Baby has a plus-0 on weight. Sonny's going to spend... Sonny's going to overclock by 3. [chuckles]
Art:        Ooh!
Austin:        So that's a plus-4 on this roll. Only rolled a 2, but that's still a 6. Uh... Baby's not really in any space to overclock, and will roll just a flat D6 here. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. [chuckles] on an attempt to — on a successful roll, with a deafening roar of shredding metal, you slam your machine into a competitor. First the losing machine takes minus 2 integrity damage. So immediately, on a successful slam, Baby takes 2 damage, before anything else happens here. Next, the victor rolls a D6 to determine additional damage. Okay, only 1. And the loser must choose between taking the result in integrity lost, or surrendering the encounter, dropping back one position. This choice represents the dilemma, whether to maintain speed during the collision, increasing damage but holding position, or to roll with the hit, reduce speed, and drop back one space and refocus. Uh, if the loser is in last place, they must take the damage or retire. Hoo, that extra 1 damage is, is a lot.
2:20:01.1        Also, I think what this damage is, is... this damage is absolutely pizza cutters coming out the side of the car, and slamming into the Tiger Bite Black and chewing it the fuck up. It's saw blades, right? But...
Art:        It's like, wacky races.
Austin:        Like wacky races is happening, correct. Or Speed Racer, right? Any of these, any of these core texts to our racing canon. Uh, god. I think Baby is [chuckling] pretty afraid in this moment, and lets, and lets Sonny pass, taking only the base 2 damage, instead of the extra 1. Uh, that was about to be extremely bad. That could have gone extremely bad, for, for Baby, is what I will say. Uh, where are we at here. Tate and, uh, uh, SC, I'm again, just going to do a quick one for Tate, trying to move up. Uh, that's a 4 against, who's Tate up against. Nebraska, right?. Uh, D6 plus 2. Uh-oh. There we go. Rolling the dice. All right, so, that doesn't move. Sorry, that was, you know, that was Tate, and here was SC. SC is going to block, and I'm just going to say, successful blocks. Because that's not an NPC, that's not even a rival behind them. All right. So, neither of them move positions. Tate can't get forward at all. And, SC manages to block the person immediately behind them. Uh, from, from moving up. Froggy, what are you doing?
Ali:        Hello, hi.
Austin:        Hello. Sharpshooter, rip-roaring, ready to go. What are you doing?
Ali:        [giggling] Yeah, I think it's time to advance, it's time to really —
Austin:        I — yeah, absolutely.
Ali:        Get some advancements here.
Austin:        Give me, uh, give me your advance. You are up against Fortinbras, The Final Word, it's the, the horse car situation.
Ali:        Oh...
Austin:        Which I think, that's a weight car, right? That feels weighty to me. So I'm going to say that's a 2 in weight.
Ali:        Is this the final lap? Or do we have one more after this?
Austin:        No, one more lap after this. One more lap after this.
Ali:        Uh, then I'm not going to overclock this time.
Austin:        Okay.
Ali:        2D6 plus 2, is a 10. Oh, wait. It's a 1D6.
Austin:        I — why did you roll 2D6?
Ali:        It's a 1D6, 1D6.
Austin:        That's 1D6 plus 2 with your acceleration.
Ali:        Plus 2 acceleration, that's an 8, though.
Austin:        That's a — yeah, you were like, actually, let me roll better. You rolled a 3 and a 5 in your first one, you rerolled, you got a 6. Goddamn.
Ali:        Wowee.
Austin:        All right. Uh, going to see if, see — it's possible to get countered here. It is possible.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        Because Fortinbras has this 2 in weight. Does not succeed. Does not succeed. You slide past. Uh, uh, good work. Moving on up. To 9th. Over to you, Wrench. Wrench, you trying to move up and pass Fortinbras also?
Sylvi:        I am!
Austin:        All right, let's do it.
Sylvi:        Uh, I'm going to overclock by 1 — can I overclock in this phase?
Austin:        Yeah, totally.
Sylvi:        I'm going to overclock by 1.
Austin:        Let's do it.
Sylvi:        Uh, that's a 6.
Austin:        Ooh, hell yeah. And then, again, just the flat D6 here. Only a 1. You also move past the horses. RIP to Fortinbras, I mean, Fortinbras' not dead. Fortinbras' Just fine, don't worry about Fortinbras. Uh, in front of you two now, Ali and, and Sylvi, is denizen A, driving the Standard Citizen. It's a, it's a race car. It's a, well, it's like a fancy car that you could race in, you know? I think that denizen A is an AI.
Ali:        [snorts] [chuckling]
Austin:        It is the average AI of everyone in Bluffington Beach, everyone in Atlantic City, driving a car that is the average car. It is the average of all cars. Uh, it was made in a lab, using data —
Art:        Inspiring, honestly. It's a —
Austin:        Mm-hm. But like, this was like. Do you know the [laughing] the most, the most unlike songs? This is like but for cars, and the most in the middle. The most, eh? Eh! You know, it's one of those. So —
Art:        Sure.
Austin:        That's what's in between the two of you and the rest of the pack, at this point. As a reminder of where we are at now, going into the final lap. In number one, we have, we have Trip Uncertainty in the lead. Behind Trip is, of course, Absolute Pluperfect. Behind Pluperfect is Sonny, Fastos, Veranda the third. Behind Sonny is Baby. Behind Baby is Callista Lee. Uh, behind Callista are Tate and SC. Our other Tigers. Behind them is Bret Nebraska, and then we get to Froggy and Wrench, and then the rest of the pack. Uh, then we get to denizen, and then we get to, uh, uh, oh, I guess I'm wrong. I guess denizen's behind you. I lost track of somebody at some point. No one died, right?
Ali:        [laughing] No.
Austin:        All right, so denizen's behind the two of you, and also behind Fortinbras. This list got weird at some point. Uh, I don't know what happened. I feel like I just had something wrong on the list. It's fine, don't worry about it. We're good. I guess Bret Nebraska, then, is in front of you, not denizen. Uh, Bret Nebraska is in the White Albatross, which is sort of like, sort of like, uh, uh, I think it's sort of like casino boat themed car, sort of like the Showtime Casino, which I think is closed now. But like a big — another way to think about it, maybe, is like, it's a big, boxy white car. Like, what if New York drug dealer culture existed in the 70s, in, in 90s New York drug dealer culture, you know what I mean? Like the White Lexus, but before cars were curvy, you know?
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        So it's like a White Cadillac, that's what it is. And also it hovers, still. It's a flying White Cadillac. Uh... new lap.
Art:        Much weirder Bruce Springsteen song.
Austin:        [chuckles] Much, much weirder.
Ali:        I do want to say here, as we're going into the final lap. I don't know how much, like, wrestling — uh, racing announcers [chuckling] like, talk about team comp, like, while the racing is happening?
Austin:        Yeah, yeah.
Ali:        But I feel like our strategy has really worked out here, where it's like —
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Ali:        You put Trip in front, and he can just go to the front. He, that's, that's what he's good at. But then you put Froggy sort of in the back, who's also really good at accelerating, but better at offence. So, like, they can fight their way past, with support from Wrench, who's like in the middle of the...
Austin:        And Wrench can hold it down so no one passes.
Ali:        Right.
Austin:        So you're always going to be in that top, top half, right? Which is where the money gets made.
Ali:        And I feel like we, we have successful, up until now — [wheezes] done this team strategy.
Austin:        Uh-huh. And we'll see if it works in this final lap.
Ali:        Uh-huh. [wheezes]
Austin:        I think this is, Ali, this conversation is happening between the two announcers, right?
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        The two announcers is, is, you know, it's one of them saying, you know —
Ali:        [announcer voice] From Team ABB today —
Austin:        [laughing] Yeah.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Now, where was this from team ABB all season, folks? If they'd been racing like this, they wouldn't be in this dilemma to begin with.
Ali:        [cackling]
Austin:        Uh, what a story, what a season. It all comes down to the this, the final lap. Uh, uh, and, uh, let's just say, for fun, there's some thunder hitting.
Ali:        Ooh.
Austin:        The clouds are, are growing over top, uh, above the sea. The waves are, are rising below the racetrack. Uh, uh, things are getting a little, a little riskier out here as the rain begins to fall here, at the Atlantic City Racetrack, out above the ocean. It's time to, it's time to start, and it's you up first, Trip.
Art:        All right, I'm going to try to hold with speed.
Austin:        Hold with speed, right? So that is D6 plus your speed. Or, wait wait wait, don't roll yet! You already rolled.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        I was going to ask if you wanted to overclock. Or are you —
Art:        No, I'm saving overclock for the end.
Austin:        But what if you get passed bad?
Ali:        Isn't this our last turn?
Austin:        This is our last turn. And what if you get passed —
Art:        But I'm going to save it for the, the, the last bit.
Austin:        Yeah, but what if you get passed multiple times here?
Art:        Uh...
Austin:        You see what I'm saying?
Art:        I do see what you're saying.
Austin:        In which case, I don't care how many times you can move up once. There are, there are three people nipping at your toes. I'll, I'll roll with what you did.
Art:        Okay.
Austin:        But I, I want you to think about your decisions here.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Art:        Well, I can't do it now, though, because now I know that if I overclock 1, I can't lose. I've like, I've broken the —
Austin:        That's not true, because you can get overtaken in the next phase, still.
Art:        No, but if — I have a 3. Plus-3 is 6.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Art:        And, wait. What happens if I tie the, the, what happens if I tie here?
Ali:        Do you want to —
Austin:        I don't fucking —
Ali:        No, I, there's no reason to... I was going to say, the thing that you want to do is hold here, right?
Art:        Right, this is a hold, but because I'm in first I can hold with speed.
Austin:        I see what you're saying.
Ali:        Oh, okay.
Austin:        Right, right, right.
Art:        And because I rolled a 3, I can't fail.
Austin:        You can't fail the hold roll here. Right.
Art:        Right. Because it's equal to or lower is I succeed. So I've already succeeded.
Austin:        You've already —
Art:        So perhaps I should have overclocked.
Austin:        Yes. But you didn't.
Art:         But I didn't, because I rolled too impulsively, which I think is a 5 chaos way to do it.
Austin:        [laughing] You know what? I think that that's fair. All right, well, I'm going to roll this push back anyway, even though you're right, it's... a tie still goes to you, right?
Art:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        Uh... yeah. Well, also I rolled a 1 on the push back. So, I think you've done a fucking good job at holding here, right?
Art:        It's real fast.
Austin:        Real fast. Real fast. Uh, god. Well, now this puts, this is interesting, because now... Absolute Perfect is also going to hold, instead of trying to overtake, right? Because... they can't overtake you. And better to be —
Art:        Right, that's what I did last time, yeah.
Austin:        We are now seeing, folks we are seeing Absolute Pluperfect —
Ali:        [giggling]
Austin:        Put Trip's own strategy, uh, uh, to the test for themselves, uh, the difference is, Absolute cannot use speed to hold on. Another note here, uh, uh, Trip, you just, the way you're holding is just by fucking gunning it, right? You're not doing any sort of tricky maneuvers to try to block them out, you're not trying to like, take the turns a little extra wide so you're in the middle and prevent people from passing on the left and the right. You're just going as fast as you fucking can. And, I'm going to just tell you, it's exhilarating.
Art:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        This is the first time you've been in the front, in the final lap, in a long time. Uh, uh, you know, you've medaled a few times, or I don't know what they call it, coming in second or third, in a race. [chuckles] It's probably not medaling, right?
Art:        I think it's placing.
Austin:        Placing. You've placed in the last season, but you've not won a race in a minute. So this is a big moment. In any case, Absolute Pluperfect, in a, in a little rough zone here in terms of numbers. Uh, is going to... has to use weight, and is not good at weight. Is going to overclock by 2, to get a plus-1 on this roll, instead of a minus-1. Only gets a 3. This could be really bad, for Pluperfect. Ooh! Very lucky roll, with a 1.
Art:        All right.
Austin:        Beats the 1, so does manage to hold onto second place here. Sonny, now forced to hold in the same way. Uh, Sonny's car built a little bit better for this, has that 1 in weight already, it's a little bit more of a, of a hefty, a hefty thing, all that pizza in there, I guess. He's still going to burn 1, uh, uh, drop to, integrity, drop 1 more integrity point, and boost this roll to a plus-2. Gets a 5. The push back says, the push back says 1. Sonny, holding onto that, that third place. Baby hates that [chuckling] that he has to hold. He is not a holder, that's not what he does. But Baby's in a much worse place in terms of integrity. I don't think Baby can risk, Baby's just going to roll it straight, roll that D6. Gets a 5, and the push back is a 5. Tie goes to the holder, you said, Art? Right? It's equal or lesser, you win?
Art:        Yeah, yeah, it's equal or lower, yeah.
Austin:        So that top 4 is locked the fuck in, which is wild. I guess at this point, we are going to see Tate try to advance. Uh, why not? It's only 1 spot, but, you know, take that one spot if you can get it.
Art:        It's money and points.
Austin:        It's money and points. It's money and points, exactly. I think Tate is going to do, is Tate going to overclock here? No. Tate is not going to overclock here. Tate is going to overclock here. Tate still has, Tate still has points to play with. So Tate's going to overclock by 2, to increase this to a plus-2 roll. Revving that engine, overclocking is hitting, hitting nitrous probably, right? That's probably what we're talking about? Incredible roll here.
Art:        Uh, yeah, probably.
Austin:        Oh my god. Gets a 7 and only a 1 on the push back. So, yeah, that's a free advance. No damage taken after that spend. Didn't need to overclock, actually, in retrospect. And here's, here's, here's the kicker, right? SC is built for this. SC has a plus-3 in weight. SC still has a ton of integrity to play with. SC is going to try to block at this point, right? Is going to try to hold —
Art:        To hold. Yeah.
Austin:        Not block, to hold. To prevent anyone from passing uh... and I think is going to spend 5 integrity on it. I mean, that's more than you need, right, because you just need to beat a 6. So the most they need to spend to succeed on this is... uh, is what? They have 3 in weight so they need to spend, they need to spend... they need to spend 5. If they spend 5, that's an automatic success, right?
Art:        Right.
Austin:        That'll put [unintelligible]
Art:        5 minus whatever their existing plus is.
Austin:        Their existing plus is 3. So I guess they only need to spend 2.
Art:        So they only spend 2.
Austin:        And that's an automatic — I guess so, right?
Art:        Yeah, because you can't roll lower than 1.
Austin:        Right. All right. So they're going to do that, they're going to spend 2, and roll a D6 plus 2. I mean, again, they don't even really need to do this, as you pointed out. Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Because they've only rolled a 4. Oh, right, plus 3, right, is a 7.
Art:        Plus 3.
Austin:        Yeah, so they're good. So they're going to succeed and hold here at seventh, doing the same job that Ali, you pointed out, that Wrench does, uh, here, kind of the anchor, blocking for the rest of the team. But, Ali, it's your turn. Does, does, uh, Froggy try to move up one more spot here?
Ali:        Uh, yeah. Is there not a roll for trying to get through someone's successful hold?
Austin:        I don't think so. I think that's the point of a hold, right?
Ali:        Okay, I thought we had mentioned that.
Art:        Yeah, a hold is, is...
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        No racers except teammates can get past you on this lap. Even teammates may only slip past at your discretion.
Ali:        Uh-huh.
Austin:        Yeah. Yeah. The, the moment would be a maneuver, when you could try to, uh, overtake in the next phase. So if you can get to, to eighth, you can pass then, you know?
Ali:        Sure. Okay. Then I don't need to overclock or anything, because there's no point. So I'm just going to roll this 1D6.
Austin:        Exactly.
Ali:        That's a 4.
Austin:        And that — that's a 4. Is that just plus-0?
Ali:        Oh, no, it's plus-2.
Austin:        It's plus-2
Ali:        So that's a 6.
Austin:        Yeah. So that's a 6. So you're going to — I think that means you're going to succeed here. Yes, you do. Uh, uh, and because you can only move up by 1 —
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        You don't have to take any damage, right? Because you should be moving up 6, which means 6 minus 4 is still 2.
Ali:        Right.
Austin:        So, yeah, you're good. You can move up 1 for free, boop. Sliding past that big White Cadillac. And now over to you for the final part of this, of this, uh, helicam phase, Wrench. Are you going to try to — I guess you don't need to hold at this point —
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        Because there's only NPCs who are not rivals behind you. So are you going to try to move up and see what happens anyway?
Sylvi:        Can I? Am I like, able to? I guess I'm one spot behind, right?
Austin:        You're one spot behind, right? So you could try it. You put 0 in accelerate, right?
Sylvi:        Yeah, I'll go for it. Yeah.
Austin:        May as well try it. Hey, it's a 5, that's not bad.
Sylvi:        5.
Austin:        And that's a 4. So, that's exactly right, right? You can move up 5 spaces, but you're only going to move up 1. So, that is no damage, you're up in 9th. All of you are in the top 10, which I will just say to you, is one of the objectives I thought about giving you instead.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        My two objective ideas were an amount of money, or all of you have to get in the top 10 to make a good showing, you know? Uh...
2:37:32.2        All right. It truly does now all come down to this, as we move into the final maneuvers phase of the race. Uh, let me paint the picture again here. That was a really, I think that that, and Ali, if you want to be my co-commentator again, please do.
Ali:        [chuckles]
Austin:        If anyone wants to call in, World Wide Wrestling, RPG style, and be like, an expert down on the course, I would love that. Uh...
Austin (as announcer):        What we just saw there, folks, was a really textbook lap, I think. You know, everyone tried their best to hold their position. Small gains, where you saw any gains at all. That's safe racing, isn't it? Jill.
Austin:        That's you, Ali. You're Jill.
Ali:        I'm Jill. Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah.
Austin:        I've decided you're Jill, the commentator. What's my, you have to tell me what my name is.
Ali:        Brobert.
Austin:        Did you say Brobert?
Ali:        [cackling] Now... I did now.
Art:        I also heard Brobert.
Sylvi:        It's Brobert now.
Austin:        Jill and Brobert are, uh...
Ali (as Jill):        Yeah, you know, at the end of the race here, people just want to, you know, secure what they have.
Austin (as Brobert):        It's sort of like life, isn't it. You start, you try to get what you can, and you keep anybody else from taking it from you.
Ali (as Jill):        It's the truth.
Austin (as Brobert):        By any means necessary. Am I right?
Ali (as Jill):        You are, indeed.
Austin (as Brobert):        Which is why I think, if you have any legal trouble, you should call, 1-888-legalfixnow. Uh, this is a sponsored message, by the way, but they've done great work for me, uh, across all of my divorces, and —
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin (as Brobert):        And, uh, I recommend the team over there with my life. So, uh, it's unofficial sponsorship.
Austin:        Uh, okay. Trip? I guess you're holding.
Art:        Yeah. Things are really bad.
Austin:        Things are not good, are they? But again, you have a position of power in a way.
Art:        Because — but if I fail this block, I could go all the way down to fifth, or be destroyed.
Austin:        It could — [laughing] or be destroyed, this is correct.
Art:        Uh... so...
Austin:        But you're in a strong position, aren't you? When you're in first, you're able to block with weight. You have to block with weight, right? You don't get to block with —
Art:        Uh-huh, and I can, I can burn 4 integrity to get it to a plus-3.
Austin:        And you have, and you have your radical bonus.
Art:        And I have a radical bonus. But like, it's not, it's not good out here.
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        Because, because Pluperfect has a natural plus-3, right?
Austin:        Pluperfect has a natural plus-3 on overtake, correct.
Art:        Yeah.
2:40:09.5        
Austin:        Which is what I think they'll do. I don't think they would slam... just because of the raw stats of it. Pluperfect also hurt pretty bad.
Art:        Yeah, they don't have a, because they don't have a car for it.
Austin:        No, they don't. Yeah, they have a —
Art:        So I'm rolling D6 plus 3.
Austin:        So you're not — wait, you're not overclocking?
Art:        That is, that is overclocking.
Austin:        Well, you're plus-3 plus-3, so you're plus 6.
Art:        No, no, because I have to block with weight —
Austin:        Oh, because it's weight, right. Fuck.
Art:        So it's plus-3.
Austin:        Are you going to spend your radical bonus.
Art:        Don't I decide after?
Austin:        I guess you do. Yeah, you're right. You do.
Art:        Uh, because, you know, with a high enough roll here —
Austin:        Then you're good, right. So you're dropping that integrity to one. I'll do that. Boom.
Art:        Thank you, thank you.
Austin:        Uh, all right. Give me this roll. That is... wait, you rolled 3D6.
Art:        Oops!
Austin:        Give me a new roll.
Art:        I thought I was doing plus-3.
Austin:        Uh-uh. Roll D6 plus-3. This is how often we roll dice like this in roll20 these days. All right. That's 7. Do you want to —
Art:        If I, if I use the radical bonus I have to take the new result?
Austin:        No, you get to pick, you get to pick whichever one you want.
Art:        All right, then it'd be stupid not to, right?
Austin:        Sure. Unless you want to save your radical bonus for —
Art:        I guess, unless I drop down [chuckling]
Austin:        Yeah, [chuckling] exactly. Well, no, because you won't get another roll, you know? So...
Art:        I would. If I dropped down, I would get to continue to defend.
Austin:        Oh, is that how that works? You get to keep defending?
Art:         Well, because overtake is always versus weight.
Austin:        I see. I see, I see, I see what you're saying. Right. Right. Yeah.
Art:        So if I save it, I can theoretically stop myself from just free falling.
Austin:        Yeah, but can you, with one integrity left? Everyone's going to be overclocking.
Art:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        Right? This is fun —
Art:        Yeah, so I guess I have to.
Austin:        This is a fun little, like — yeah, uh-huh.
Art:        Yeah, I was in the second lap being like, “this is boring,” and now I'm like, “I am riveted by this.”
Austin:        [laughing] Uh, for people at home, just to really sell you on this — Art, because of the overclock, has been left with one integrity point. As a reminder, if you drop to zero integrity, you roll a die, and if you roll a 1 you're dead because your car exploded before you could eject. This is, this is what the high-stakes life of, of future car racing is like. This is the world out here. People are out here putting their lives on the line to entertain the folks at home. I've slipped back into Brobert's voice now.
2:42:36.0        I want people to know how exciting this race is.
Ali:        [giggling]
Ali (as Jill):        We haven't seen a performance from this like Trip for... in the last 20 years. This is historic racing today.
Ali:        I don't know how old Trip — [cackling]
Austin:         Trip is older than I thought he was.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        They start 'em real young on the... [laughing] I remember Trip, 4 years old, crying —
Austin (as Brobert):        Thanks for that historical context, [unintelligible], I really [unintelligible]
Ali:         Trip could be in his 40s... [cackling]
Austin:        Yeah, uh-huh.
Ali (as Jill):        Trip is out here, racing like this is his first race. He's racing like he's trying to get signed.
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        [chuckling] All right, I'm going to use the radical point —
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Art:        Because I can pick.
Austin:        You can pick, you can pick. Which —
Art:        Because, 7's not bad.
Austin:        7's not bad.
Art:        It's higher than the die goes.
Austin:        It is.
Art:        Same thing.
Austin:        Same thing. Faded. Faded.
Art:        What a waste of my time —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        What a waste of my time that radical bonus was!
Austin:        All right. Well, that means that... Pluperfect is going to overclock. Oh, this is bad for you, Art. This isn't, this isn't good. Right?
Art:        Just roll another 1.
Austin:        That's what it has to be. So, Pluperfect's coming into this with 4 integrity, which means he's burning 3, plus 3 is 6. Has to be a 1. Has to be a 1. D6, plus 6. It has to be a 1. Doesn't have a radical point to spend. Has to be a 1.
Art:        Oh, I should have argued that I should have gotten to keep that 5.
Austin:        You should have made that argument, you didn't make that argument, did you?
Art:        Ugh!
Austin:        That's a 9. That's a 3 on the die, plus 6.
Sylvi:        Oh, boy.
Austin:        As Absolute Pluperfect slides into first.
Ali:        [gasps]
Austin:        What happens here? How did this happen to you?
Art:        Oh, I should have dropped! That's what I should have done in the maneuvers phase, I should have —
Austin:        You should have dropped one, uh-huh.
Art:        I should have dropped one, I should have retreat —
Austin:        You had that — you had that plan, but your chaos is too high.
Ali:        You can retreat to bring yourself —
Austin:        And now, we're in a sticky wicket, aren't we?
Art:        Yeah.
Ali:        [chuckling]
Austin:        Now we're in a tough position. And I have to make a decision here, because —
Art:        Oh, no, retreating would have been a disaster.
Austin:        Oh, would it have been? Why?
Art:        Because you can't retreat and then hold.
Austin:        Oh, right right right.
Art:        So I would have just gotten passed.
Austin:        You would have gotten passed, yeah, yeah, yeah. That string of holds is what kept you in it to begin with, here. Now, I do have, there is something here, which is, I've introduced a plotline between Sonny and, not the black tristars, the, uh, — what the fuck is the name?
Ali:        The Tiger Bites.
Austin:        Tiger Bite trio, yeah, uh-huh.
Art:        Tiger —
Austin:        Uh, which is: Sonny is not happy with Baby. Baby fucked up the ride. That can ruin sponsorship money. Also, there is incentive to knock people out of the race. I didn't read this rule out loud, did I. But, I didn't mention —
Art:        No, you did not.
Austin:        I didn't mention, there are fiscal rewards for doing damage. Quote: after a race, the Rip league sells commemorative holocards of every crash. Ghoulish collectors avidly hoard these keepsakes, which show looping footage of spectacular and deadly on-track disasters. We live in a nightmare dystopia world in this game, y'all. For each slam you successfully perform — Sonny's already gotten one — the league cuts you a one-off profit share payment of 500 credits, boosted to 1500 if the slam destroys a competitor's machine or forces them to retire.
Art:        Oh, so it's more profitable for Sonny to knock out Baby than to —
Austin:        This is the thing, because —
Art:        Advance a spot.
Austin:        That's exactly —
Art:        That's only 200 credits to go up.
Austin:        That's exactly it. Because if Sonny gets, behind Sonny is Baby, right? Behind Baby is, is Tate. If Baby gets knocked out, Tate moves up, and then maybe Tate overtakes Sonny. But, uh, uh, whoever's in 6th is not going to overtake — Callista is not going to overtake Sonny, because Sonny has plot armor as a rival, and Callista does not have the ability to make a maneuver in this phase, in fact, can only remain where she is by nature of, uh, uh, SC failing to move up in that scenario, right? So, and the difference in payout, I'm looking at the numbers here. Right now, as it stands, number one is 4000 credits. Number two is 3800 credits. Number 3 is 3600 credits, number 4 is 3400 credits. That's only a 200 credit difference. It's not a, it's no fucking, you know, sweat off of Sonny's back to come in second instead of third in terms of money. That money's good. The money's good. You know what money is better? Is knocking Baby out of the fucking race.
2:47:34.8        So, Sonny is going to slam Baby. Let's see how it goes. Spending, 3 points on overclock to drop down to 1 integrity. So that's a plus- 3 on a roll that was already a plus-1. So this is a plus-4 roll. That's a 9. I don't think Baby's got it like that. Baby's going to —
Art:        Good luck, Baby.
Austin:        [chuckles] Baby's going to try to defend with, uh, uh, Baby has a zero, is going to spend — Baby's done. Baby can't defend this. So Baby should not try to overclock here, in fact, right? Because — no, Baby's done. The math just doesn't work out for Baby, folks. The math is bad. So, Sonny just rolled a 9. Baby has 2 integrity left, and has a 0 in weight. That means the best Baby can roll, uh, uh, if he overclocks, is a 7, which is a failure. Baby's done. [chuckles] I'm going to do it just for the sake of it, I'm just going to roll that D6 straight. That's a 4. 4 is less than, uh, than than, uh, uh, 9. So Baby immediately takes minus 2, and takes another just for the sake of it, let's see. [laughing] Another 6.
2:48:49.9        So, Sonny went ham. Sonny went wild. Sonny just did some — what did Sonny do? What is the most destructive thing you could do to an — in fact, we have to roll a die now, to see if Baby lives.
Ali:        [gasps]
Art:        Yeah, you gotta roll a D6.
Austin:        All right, let's see. Here's the D6 — if it's a 1, Baby is dead, right?
Art:        Yeah.
Ali:        Wow.
Austin:        It's a 2, so it was very close.
Art:        Ooh! Hoo hoo.
Austin:        What did Sonny do, to completely destroy the Tiger Bite Black?
Art:        Maybe like a possum play, maybe like, makes Baby think they are overtaking?
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        And then, Sonny has speed — like —
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        Hits the accelerator and like, just, basically, you know, like a pit maneuver but on a hovercar —
Austin:        On a hovercar with, with spinning saws, also are happening.
Art:        Wouldn't really work, with like the hovercar maneuver.
Austin:        Illegal spinning saws cut into —
Art:        Sure.
Austin:        Into, and like, cut it in half, in a way, you know what I mean? Like, bisected horizontally across the length of the car. Just completely devastated. It goes flying. Baby, you know, ejects from the car a second before, uh, it explodes. Sonny points his hand up in like a, in a finger gun thing, and goes, “pow,” at the ejector seat, and like, pretends to goose him. Pow, got him.
Art:        Oh, that's going to make a good holocard.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Oh, the holocard's incredible. I'm going to give Sonny a bonus on that holocard. Sonny's going to make an extra 500 on the back end on that one. Baby, out of the race. Tate, automatically — everyone automatically moves up 1, as Tate moves to, to 20th/did not finish. What a moment, here, at the, at the racetrack, folks. It is now — Tate, —
Art:        Sonny could really have a time here, because, because if the, if the teammate decides to get revenge, they could also get knocked out.
Austin:        Oh, this is about to happen, isn't it? This is about to happen. Tate moves up, immediately now, behind Sonny with Baby out. And, Tate, let me tell you, Tate has been reserving. Tate still has 7 integrity left.
Art:        Ooh!
Austin:        [laughing] It's going to look bad for Sonny, Fastos/ Sonic Veranda the third. Roll a D6. [laughing] add 6 to it, for this slam maneuver between Tate and Sonny. This roll has to be — oh my god, that's a 10. Sonny, what are you going to do about this, buddy? You didn't think this through. You're going to get — you're just going to roll a D6, that's a failure. Sonny's out.
Ali:        Gasps.
Austin:        Sonny —
Art:        That's, that's minus 2, yeah.
Austin:        That's minus 2 just from that, plus another D6 of damage, only another 1 there. But that, but that knocks him out. That's three damage. Sonny only had 1 integrity left. That knocks —
Art:        Oh, you've got to roll [unintelligible] Sonny to eject.
Austin:        I've got to roll for Sonny to eject, oh, no!
Sylvi:        Oh, jeez.
Ali:         What if Sonny dies here?
Austin:        Okay, Sonny's fine.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:         Sonny sees it coming. Sonny knew that this was, this was — Sonny made a bad play. Sonny should have stayed calm and held, and then none of this would have happened. Because, Sonny would have held on — in fact, Sonny just lost a lot of money. Sonny made the —
Art:        That was a lot of, yeah, that was a bad financial decision.
Austin:        That was a bad financial decision. We went on the same journey Sonny did there. We started doing math in our heads, like, ooh!
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Plus 2000 from the extra slam money, plus I get third place money? That didn't happen to you, did it, Sonny? Sonny, you got knocked back also, you did not finish. Tate moves up to third place.
Ali (as Jill):        This is what we call risk and reward, folks.
Austin (as Brobert):        This is why people watch.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin (as Brobert):        You can talk all day about technique, you can talk all day about the old way of doing it. You just stick the tires on the track, or the hover wheels a few feet above the track, depending on your tradition. But it's, it's, it's the boom. It's the boom bang bam! That's what people tune in for, Jill! I just think it's, we've got to stop pretending that's not what people like. I get it, you know, the, the board has their whole thing about player safety, driver safety, I think that's important. But you got to be honest about why people are tuning in, and if you don't like it, you change the culture. But that's a whole, that's a generational difference, isn't it? Anyway, there's only a few more seconds in the race, we should probably pay attention and see how it goes!
Art:        [wheezes laughing]
Ali:        Does everyone move up once because somebody got knocked out?
Austin:        Did I not just do that?
Art:        Yeah, yeah.
Austin:        I only moved Tate up.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        So yes, everyone moves up one here. Boop, boop, boop.
Art:        This is going to be a good, this is going to be a good —
Ali:        Yeah.
Art:        Day for your team.
Austin:        Yeah, y'all are making pay, you're getting paid! Again, where was, where was this, from the Asteroid Belt Barbershop team all season?
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        Uh...
Art:        We're going to clear like, like 80K!
Austin:        [laughing] You're not going to clear 80K!
Art:        Oh, it's not 38,000, it's 3800, okay.
Austin:        [laughing] Yes. We found out that Trip does not –
Art:        Well, this why you don't put a C at the end of your numbers for the thing.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Art:        That's why no one does that in the real world. It looks like another zero.
Austin:        It does look like another zero, that's how they get you. All right, SC, uh, with a lot of integrity left, is going to try to overtake here. Uh, uh, going to blow through, again, I think actually is safe here. Uh, is that true? From Callista, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. Okay, so — or I guess — yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's going to be fine. So, yeah, SC is going to, is going to spend 5, uh, 5 integrity to overclock, big spend here, but, but that's because, has a kind of slow car, has a minus 1 speed car, so, this is only, in fact, a plus-4. That's only a 6, this may not work, versus Callista's plus-2. Jeez. No, no, no. Plus zero, because Callista's — okay, not plus-2. Plus zero is weight. Uh, I'm going to say Callista still has 1 point to spend on overclock, I think that that's fair, even though we're not tracking non-rival stuff. Uh, so let's see.
2:54:43.6        Callista does not manage to hold on, Callista loses a slot here, as, uh, uh, SC moves up into fourth place. Froggy, what are you doing? Are you going to try to move past Callista here?
Ali:        See, I'm fucked up now, okay. So [laughing] my original plan —
Austin:        Uh-huh?
Ali:        Was, to slam the person in front of me, because even if I couldn't advance, I would get the extra slam bonus, right?
Austin:        Oh, true. True.
Ali:        But now I'm feeling like, I'm in sixth place, and to have two team members be in the top 5...
Austin:        Ah, that means something.
Ali:        Right?
Austin:        There's, there's a little bit of something there. This is where reputation comes from, isn't it? It's that like, what's this decision? Are you going to make the money decision, where you potentially hurt somebody else? You don't know what her integrity is.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        Right? Uh, uh, or, do you make the, the money decision of the long play, which is, two people in the top 5, that looks pretty good on a score sheet.
Ali:        Do we have specific —
Art:        Well, it's 400 credits for moving up, and 500 for a slam, but 1500 to destroy.
Ali:        [laughing]
Art:        So it's only 100 for a slam that doesn't destroy them — and if you destroy them, you move up to fifth anyway, so... that's the biggest potential reward.
Ali:        Oh, sure.
Austin:        That's the biggest potential win, yeah.
Sylvi:        I... was going to ask, actually. Because we're so close in positioning, would I be able to like, do a slam, so Froggy could get ahead? Or is that just not like, a feasible thing here?
Austin:        [sighs] It's not a feasible thing here, in terms of play —
Sylvi:        Okay.
Austin:        I see what you're doing. You could slam the person behind you for extra money —
Sylvi:        No, that's not —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        That's not you, that's not who Wrench is, Wrench is sweet.
Art:        Well, as a maneuver, Froggy could drop back one to let Wrench —
Austin:        Oh, is that a free maneuver?
Art:         Wrench do the slam.
Austin:        Is that a free maneuver? That would work, wouldn't it?
Ali:        Yeah, I guess we did it for free last time.
Austin:        It doesn't even matter if it's free, right? Yeah, okay, wait. Sacrifice a position before a maneuver. Should you wish, when it's your turn in maneuvers phase, you can opt to fall back one position before taking your turn. For instance, if you want to block or slam a rival who is two positions behind you at the start of your turn, you can fall back — for instance, if you would like to block or slam a rival, who is two positions behind you. You cannot fall back more than one position — so, yes. Ali, you could fall back one, to let, uh, Wrench move up and try this slam, instead.
2:57:04.9        But what that wouldn't do is, I guess you could fall back and like, block the person behind you, you know what I mean?
Art:        Or you could fall back and [laughing] slam the person behind you.
Austin:        Right, for the most money.
Sylvi:        Well, also, when you overtake — like, I think if you did your move as an overtake, I could also, like, allow you to pass because we're teammates. Is that how we do that?
Austin:        Right, but the thing is, the, the way it works right now is, the move back would happen right before you do your maneuver, I believe. It's when it's your turn —
Art:        Yeah, it doesn't change the maneuver [unintelligible]
Austin:        Right. So it would stay Ali's turn, at which point she would have to make a decision, make a move. And at that point, if she did overtake, she'd be overtaking you.
Sylvi:        Okay.
Art:        But if you knock that person out, although they could always drop back it instead of taking the extra damage.
Austin:        I don't, I mean, this is a, this is an NPC who is not a rival, which means I'm not going to like, make any clever plays. So, yes, you could move black and block still, for instance, or move back and slam, still.
Sylvi:        Unless, I mean, we'd both be rolling 1D6 plus 2. I was just thinking, for the money stuff, it [unintelligible]
Austin:        Oh.
Sylvi:        But I can, I can just slam the person behind me then, if we're, if, uh, —
Art:        Well, but you could roll plus 9. Or plus 10.
Austin:        Right. This is the thing. Because you have — and also your weight is plus-2. You have all that integrity left. I guess it's worth saying, wait a second, it's worth saying, integrity does cost — you do have to repair your car after this.
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Ali:        Mmm.
Austin:        And also Wrench loves —
Art:        What!?
Austin:        [laughing] ha-ha-ha! Uh-huh. But you're going to be fine, Art, because you're getting so much pay off this.
Sylvi:        I was like, oh, maybe I'll use 1 integrity. Not 9 of them.
Austin:        Uh-huh. Everyone's out here, it's the end of the season, you know? Go hard.
Sylvi:        Ugh.
Austin:        Uh, so anyway, what are we doing? Do we want to —
Ali:        Uh, I think probably, if this — the best way to do it, in terms of not spending integrity, and to have it go efficiently is, I try to overtake the person in front of me, making that person go to 6, and then Sylvi can slam them —
Austin:        And then Sylvi slams, right?
Ali:        Yeah, it's a little ping-pong situation.
Sylvi:        Dig it.
Austin:        That makes sense.
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        All right. Give me your, Froggy, then, give me your acceleration, your overtake. Are you going to —
Ali:        I'm am going to, I'm going to overclock just the one here, bringing my integrity from a 7 to a 6, and then my plus acceleration from a 2 to a 3.
Austin:        To a 3, yeah.
Ali:        1D6 plus 3 —
Austin:        Very good.
Ali:        Is a 9.
Austin:        Ooh, that's a perfect roll.
2:59:41.7        I don't think, you know, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to roll, I'm just going to roll a D6 and see. And see how much integrity Callista has left, do you think that's fair? Because she's not a character who we have tracked. I think the book does just suggest, like I said this before, conjuring stats up here. Uh, I guess we know that Callista, at plus 0, would have started at 8 integrity. Uh, and, has had —
Art:        Wait, this was, this was an overtake or a slam?
Austin:        This is an overtake, so it's weight to defend, and I'm debating if Callista has, I'm debating if Callista can overclock, is what I'm trying to decide. Uh, because it says, don't bother keeping track of, don't bother keeping track of the remaining integrity points of non-rival NPCs, ba ba ba ba ba... yeah, so I'm not taking — you know what? Let me just say that she doesn't have it spend. I think that's more interesting, and she's just going to roll it straight, which for her is still a plus-2, but that's just not going to be enough. Wow. She rolled a 6, plus-2, but you're plus-3. That overclock you spent, Ali, did it.
3:00:54.8        What does, what — tell me that that looks like. Why does the overclock give you the win here?
Ali:        Uh, I think it's just like efficient maneuvering, right? That you sort of like try to play chicken with somebody, and it's sort of like, inching, inching ahead of each other, then you wait for the window to like, the pump the whatever. Uh...
Austin:        Yeah. The nitrous, the NOS, obviously.
Ali:        [laughing] sure. Is this NOS here? I mean, we're in hovercars or whatever, so... you
Austin:        You're hovercars, you're... I, the, the actual write-up in the book about what overclocking is, is that like, you get to do a little extra boosts from your boost core, but it hurts your car a little bit. And it's, you know. That's not that different from NOS running through your engine, probably? Right?
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        Uh, also I'm wrong about this roll. She got a plus-0 to that roll, not a plus-2, because this is weight for her. So it doesn't matter. She did roll a 6, but it's just not going to save her, and you overtake her. And you move into fifth. All right.
3:01:52.2         Wrench, is it slam time?
Sylvi:        Yeah, it's smack time. I'm also going to spend one overclock on this.
Austin:        All right, do the damn thing.
Sylvi:        I got a 7 overall.
Austin:        Uh, that means you're going to win, because, because, again, she only has a plus-0. So that is immediately, uh, taking 2 damage [chuckles] to her. Give me your D6, to do extra damage.
Sylvi:        That's a 3.
Austin:        That's a 3, which is 5. I think that's it for Callista. I can't imagine being in this race, where everyone's been so aggro, and I don't know that she's been — like I could go back and do those push, those push back rolls, but... her weight was low, I think that that — I think that 5 damage is enough to, to — I guess she could take less position again, here. But I think that that's, that's too big of a hit. I don't think she has it. So... unless you want me not to roll this. Do you want to have knocked her out? How about this, maybe this is gooding characterization? Do you want to hit hard enough to have knocked her out? Because I think it actually does say that you can do damage up to the number, right?
Sylvi:        Oh.
Austin:        I'm pretty sure, it does, it does say you don't have to do a knock out.
Sylvi:        I just think, with the type of car that Wrench is driving, it's hard to sort of pull your punches.
Austin:        Yeah, that makes sense.
Sylvi:        Uh, it's a very heavy thing, and like, I think if it's coming at you on the side, it's going to just wreck you, which is how I'm picturing it.
Austin:        Right. All right. Well, then, I'm going to roll D6 and hope I don't get a 1. All right, very close. Wrench, what does this look like? I rolled a 2 here, for the survival roll for Callista. You've almost — it was a little late. Callista ejected at the last possible second. What the, what's the, uh, what's the hit look like from —
Sylvi:        I think —
Austin:        From the Cherry bomb.
Sylvi:        It's like, it happens right as, I think because — the, the, I'm kind of picturing the sequence as being like, right after Froggy takes, like, the lead of Callista.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Sylvi:        And so I think, like — is it she/her for Callista?
Austin:        She/her for Callista, correct, yeah.
Sylvi:        I think she just like, doesn't notice in time, that the Cherry Bomb's like, right behind her, and like, when she's trying to get her, like, I think she's trying to get her bearings straightened out a little bit. And it just like, hits her car on like the nose, and it just like, spins out.
Austin:        God. And, uh, last second ejects, and I'm going to say, at that point, Fortinbras, in the Final Word, like, crashes the horse car into the remains of it. Uh, and that spins off and causes a huge pile-up, behind, behind him. Uh, and, you know, some of the cars pass by, some other ones don't. It's a mess. It's all over the news, basically immediately. Uh, but all of you finish the race, uh, uh, ahead of, you know, there's just fire on the track, you know. It's just behind you, it has gone really bad, uh, uh, from this. Uh, I don't think that there's like a hard end of the race thing, besides, uh, besides doing, doing, uh, you know, money stuff here. So, I will say, give me your, what is the image of your car passing the finish line, here? Uh, what do the cameras catch, as you, as you slide here, into the place that you're in? I guess, Tate — or, not Tate, sorry, Trip, you're up first. Tate is behind you.
3:05:23.5        
Art:        Yeah, uh, I think it's like, uh, at the actual finish line, it's a little cautious, just trying to keep second. But like, with all of the stuff that happened behind, there's probably a little bit of distance there —
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        Uh, because of all the explosions.
Austin:        [chuckles] uh-huh!
Art:        [wheezes] Uh, and it's, it's a visibly frustrated Trip.
Austin:        Uh, Tate and SC pass, each go through the, go through the finish line, effectively together, with, with Tate being given the win here, effectively. That's the roles that they're meant to play on their teams. Uh, Froggy and, and Wrench, how about you? What are your, what do you, what's the camera catch as you go through? Is there an expression on your face, is there a pose you're making? Is it eyes on the road?
Ali:        Uh, I think it's still like, like, visibly aggressive driving. I think there's a little bit of showboating here in terms of being like, I mean, we didn't keep track of everybody, in terms of being like, the person who made the most gains in the race.
Austin:        Right, right. But, I think it's you, right? You were 13th to begin.
Ali:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        And now you're fifth. That's, what is that, eight spots? That ain't bad. I don't remember who started where either at this point —
Ali:        [laughing]
Austin:        And my notes don't have original placements, but —
Ali:        Well, I know —
Austin:        I think that's the biggest gain.
Ali:        The chip people basically moved over, same with Trip.
Austin:        Right, and you did more than them.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        You moved over two columns. So, yeah, that's pretty big.
Ali:        Yeah.
Austin:        Yeah. So, so... a little bit showboaty, a little bit happy here. How about you, Wrench?
Sylvi:        Uh, I think it's [laughing] a little bit of the opposite, where I think there's like, one of the cameras that's filming the race gets a close-up of her face while she's pulling in the, the, the finish line, and she's clearly trying not to cry right now —
Ali:        Aw!
Sylvi:        Because it was so stressful [chuckling]. You
Austin:        Wrench, oh, buddy!
Sylvi:        It's like, oh, we made it through okay!
Austin:        And of course —
Sylvi:        She's not a driver!
Austin:        Of course there are camera drones flying down to take your photos. Uh, there's no people here, right? Uh, I think even your pit crew is probably robotic. And, and, you know, everyone who is like, again, all of the drones do have, uh, videos, or like holograms of reporters yelling questions at you. And it's lots of like, at this point, uh, uh, “Wrench, it's a lot of like, do you feel responsible for the crashes that came after your overtake —“ they don't say slam attempt, because they don't talk in those terms, but they say, you know, “your aggressive overtake in the final lap,” and it's lots of people yelling at you, which is not good. Uh, does anyone —
Sylvi:        Oh, no...
Austin:        Does anyone do anything in response to this?
Ali:        Are we all going to the same, like —
Art:        Oh, this is like a media scrub?
Austin:        Yeah, it's like, it's like a media scrub immediately. Like, Wrench is out of the car, like, the people aren't even on the podiums yet. Uh,, and the media is immediately like, descending on wrench via floaty hover drones and questions about this accident, because, despite there being a lot of other crashes on, on, you know, during the race, this was the one that inadvertently led to the larger one. Fortinbras, really the one who blew it all up, by refusing to swerve around Callista, or Callista's wreckage. But, you were the one who hit Callista. And as you said, the car kind of does what it wants at a certain... it's like, you don't, you can't pull your punches.
Sylvi:        Yeah.
Austin:        And, and, I think immediately, that has become a media narrative here. So, yeah.
Ali:        Are we able to like —
Art:        Yeah, I'll — oh, go ahead.
Ali:        I was just going to say, are we able to like, guide Wrench to the garage, like, away from some of the, the —
Austin:        Sure, yeah.
Art:        Uh, if it'll help, I'm willing to try to create a bigger scene.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        Ooh, all right. Now, that to me sounds like a 5 chaos. So what are you trying to do?
Art:        I'm just going to like, start acting, like, you know, visibly frustrated coming in, but like was going to deal with it.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Art:        And instead, it's like, throwing helmet, yelling at the pit crew, you know —
Austin:        Which is robots, by the way, again. Which, I love it.
Art:        Yeah, yelling at a robot.
Austin:        Yeah. [robot noises]
Art:        You know, “where were you? Where was this? Where was my structural integrity? I needed to, I needed more speed on the final stretch, you saw that. Where was it? We don't have a worse car than he does! We have a worse pit crew than he does!”
Sylvi:        I do want to put out we have implied that Wrench was the mechanic for these two, which might means she's also in charge of the pit crew [laughing]
Art:        Yeah, but this is fake.
Ali:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        No, sure, for sure. It's just very funny. It's just very funny.
Austin:        Give me a, give me a chaos. You need a — roll a D6, you're trying to roll under, uh, the 5, right? Is that right? Is that how that works?
Art:        Yeah, right?
Austin:        Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh-huh. So it's a 2, under, if you roll lower than your racer's chaos theory number, succeed. Uh, uh, so yeah. I think those cameras that were gathered around Wrench spin over, and, and begin to hover around you. And, immediately, the questions hit you, and the questions are like — “ Once again, you failed to seal the deal.”
Sylvi:        Damn. God.
Austin:        “Are we ever going to see a first place win again from Trip Uncertainty? Well, that's the right name for you.” Like, all that shit just —
Art (as Trip):        Yeah, maybe if I get some good robots we'll see a first place finish, if some robots can, can close the deal, maybe I can close the deal. But right now I'm getting a bad car.
3:11:01.7        
Austin:        Uh, and I think we get a little montage here, uh, as music plays, as you get up on the second place to podium, and Absolute Pluperfect says to you, you know, uh, uh, “always second place, hm, Trip?”
Art (as Trip):        Yeah, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself-place.
Austin:        [laughing]
Sylvi:        [cackling]
Austin:        I think Tate just looks over —
Art:        Does not say it under his breath at all.
Sylvi:        [chuckling]
Austin:        Tate, I think, is like, “hey, come on, the cameras are on. Keep it cool.”
Art (as Trip):        Yeah, I see them.
Sylvi:        [laughing]
Austin:        Uh, uh...
Art:        Trip is making no doubt that all of the racing [unintelligible] going to lead with him tomorrow. [laughing]
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        No one's talking about Wrench in the morning.
Austin:        What is the — so yeah, meanwhile, in the, in the garage, Wrench and Froggy, what is the wind-down images we get of you?
Ali:        Uh, just like, reassurance talk, like, “you did good up there, you watched our back. Your car looks all right. Right, like we got out out of there.” That kind of...
Sylvi:        I think it's like, Wrench is like, “I'm so glad you guys are safe.” And then she sees, like, the Liminal Space in such —
Ali:        [cackling]
Sylvi:        Terrible condition [chuckling], and her like expression just completely changes.
Austin:        [chuckling]
Sylvi:        She's like, “what did he do to you?” Goes over and starts comforting the car. Uh, so that's what she does.
Austin:        Incredible. I think we probably get a little bit of a, a shot of Sonny uh, uh, being confronted by the, uh, the Tiger boys after that, that exchange. And Sonny is very, like, hands up, please don't hit me, I'm just a little guy. And the Tiger, uh, trio is, the Tiger Bite Trio is not moved by that, but is moved by a couple of dudes who show up in suits, uh, who seem like maybe they're a little even more ready to get violent, and the Tiger Bite boys also think about their sponsorship deal, and the commercials, and the rap career that Baby wants to have after this, and steps back.
3:13:15.6        Uh, and then I'd say, like, you know, it's a little bit later when finally, there is a, uh, uh, uh, the, the, a knock, maybe, on your door. Uh, and the, the, you know, when the door opens up, or maybe someone puts in a code, and it opens up, they are backlit, uh, and it is someone coming to make you an offer. And we'll pick up there, next time.
