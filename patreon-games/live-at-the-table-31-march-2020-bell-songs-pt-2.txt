Live at the Table 31: March 2020 - Bell Songs Pt. 2
Transcriber: Parker (@spidertrans22) [00:00-23:50), anachilles#0191 (to end)


Austin: Welcome to Live at the Table, an actual-play livestream focused on critical worldbuilding, smart characterization, and fun interaction between good friends. I'm your host, Austin Walker. Joining me today, Keith Carberry.


Keith: Hi! My name is Keith J. Carberry, you can find me on Twitter @keithjcarberry, and you can find the Let's Plays that I do at YouTube.com/RunButton.


Austin: Also joining us, Art Martinez-Tebbel.


Art: Hey you can find me on Twitter @atebbel, where we're asking, 'Who can say where the road goes? Where the day flows?'


Austin: [chuckles] Okay. [pause] Only time, is--we know the answer to this. This isn't--


Art: (cross) We don't know, we couldn't possibly know.


Keith: (cross) Is there an official response [???] Enya?


Austin: Only time! Enya told us this. Are you saying Enya lied?


Keith: (cross) No! No.


Austin: (cross) Because it sounds like you're saying Enya's a liar. Are you calling Enya a liar?


Keith: (cross) I think there's--


Art: (cross) I think she might be mistaken.


Austin: (cross) I see.


Keith: (cross) I think there's room for musical uh... [pause] for um, for musical reinterpretance of that. Reinterpretance?


Austin: Hm. Ye--sure.


Art: Reinterpretation?


Keith: Reinterpretation. Yeah.


Austin: Yeah, reinterpretance is when you inherited an interpretation.


Keith: Yup.


Austin: (laughs) Uh...


Keith: Fifteen minutes ago I was ten steps behind and I'm close, I'm only like two steps off now.


Austin: Of where you normally are.


Keith: Yeah, yeah.


Austin: Gotcha, gotcha. Well today, we're gonna continue our game of Bell Songs, a game of animal adventure, a hack of Delver and Blades in the Dark by Natalie The Knife. You can follow Natalie on Twitter @rpgnatalie and find the game at rpgnatalie.itch.io. Um, what's, how do we play this game? Where were we. We'd, we'd had a feast, we had, had some connections, some bonding, you may recall. Uh, though, now that I'm looking at it, I feel like maybe you didn't mark bond with each other. Who's missing bond with each other? Oh no there it is, Bartel Bond, yeah you got it. Yeah there it is, I see it now. Um, we had, I had trained some singing, I trained my foolish nephew in singing. Um, so we're getting there. Yeah, you got a second dot in singing which is good. And then what happened?


Art: I don't remember any of those verses anymore.


Austin: Uh, don't worry, (laughs) we'll figure it out. (laughs) We just roll this in! Maybe we woke up, despite being better at singing, we've lost the song.


Art: Oh NO.


Austin: I think this is a good, it turns out we've slept in, what we thought was a safe forest clearing, turned out to be, uh, like the Den of Forgetfulness, you know, or the Glade of Forgetfulness. I think this is a great opening, (cross) opening bit.


Keith: [cross] I have bad news.


Art: [cross] [singing] Who can say what city was first, was it the red city only time knows


[Austin laughing]


Austin: It's not only time knows!


Art: But now it is! That's [???]


Austin: Fuck! Um. Keith, go ahead, Bartel.


           Keith (as Bartel): I have bad news. We thought this was a regular glade, this is the Glade of Forgetfulness!


Austin: I have to find this voice again, fuck.


           Keith (as Bartel): It's the one thing I can remember, confidentally.


           Art (as Stoffle): You remember *forgetting* glades?


           Keith (as Bartel): I remember that glades can make you forget.


           Austin (as Katya): And this is that glade. This is the Glade of Forgetfulness.


           Keith (as Bartel): It's one of three.


           Austin (as Katya): Where are the other two?


           Keith (as Bartel): Um...


Art: Was this always so Russian?


Austin: [in Katya's voice] [cross] It was close, was close.


Keith: [cross] Yeah, it was.


           (as Bartel): Well, one of them, one of them is a few miles away, one of them is really far away, and then one of them's more of a meadow, and you'll know it when you see it.


           Austin (as Katya): [cross] You've now named... [laughs]


           Art (as Stoffle): [cross] You're remembering a lot...


           Austin (as Katya): ...four. You said three, you said there were three and this was one, now there are four.


           Keith (as Bartel): Yeah the fourth one was the meadow. The one that's more of a meadow.


           Austin (as Katya): Hm. [pause] [cross] Nevertheless...


           Keith (as Bartel): [cross] That's all I remember.


           Austin (as Katya): I believe we need to find the Cave of Bees? Is there danger to stay here in the glade and find our way, or...? What should we do, Mysterio?


           Keith (as Bartel): We should remove ourselves from the glade, and then try and remember.


           Austin (as Katya): I see.


Austin: Um, alright, so. I don't remember whose turn it was last, I think it was, I think it was mine? So let's go to Bartel maybe? As our guide anyway, that makes sense? Uh, when you were in focus you describe what you do as you go about achieving your goal. You describe what you do, what you say, what you feel, what you think; your friends will describe the world, speak for other characters, and judge the effectiveness of your actions. At any point during your turn, especially when it feels like something interesting should happen, a friend can introduce a threat, an obstacle, or an opportunity. When you do something to resolve a threat or an obstacle, anyone can say what you do is dangerous, uncertain, or both. If it's dangerous, a friend will tell you how you've made yourself vulnerable. If it is uncertain--that is to say, if the way that you resolve, you try to resolve the threat or obstacle is uncertain--a friend will tell you whether or not you make it based on their gut instinct. If it is both dangerous and uncertain, a friend will tell you how the situation escalates and becomes worse. However, you can veto whatever decision they would make, by declaring that you are going to roll. So, Bartel, talk to us about getting out of this glade, the Glade of Forgetfulness.


[pause]


           Keith (as Bartel): Um... well the good news is, fortunately... it's pretty much just a straight shot the way that we came in, to get out of the glade.


           Austin (as Katya): Oh.


           Art (as Stoffle): [cross] We're gonna go backwards?


           Keith (as Bartel): [cross] Unfortunately... what's that?


           Art (as Stoffle): We're gonna go backwards?


           Austin (as Katya): Towards the sweet frogs?


           Keith (as Bartel): Well we can at lea--we can, you know, get--here's the, but the bad news is, I don't remember which way is the out.


           Art (as Stoffle): What if we go through?


           Austin (as Katya): What if we go up?


           Art (as Stoffle): No, that's too, you can't go up.


           Keith (as Bartel): How do you go up?


           Austin (as Katya): Climb.


Austin: Cracks back, like, shows badger claws.


Keith: What is a glade, [cross] geographically?


Art: [cross] Yeah I thought a glade was a... are the Everglades a glade?


Austin: I guess a glade is a, is, it says it's an open space, but I--you know, there's still trees around, right?


Keith: Okay, there's still trees--yeah.


Austin: It's like a, like a field, [cross] but this says, 'glades--'


Keith: [cross] Are you operating under the floor is lava rules?


           Austin (as Katya): In terms of forgetfulness? Yes. If we are above the Glade of Forgetfulness, we will not be forgetful.


           Keith (as Bartel): Okay, I buy that.


           Art (as Stoffle): Sure.


           Keith (as Bartel): Yeah, um. Stoffle, can you... climb and y'know, jump and stuff?


           Art (as Stoffle): I have to assume.


[Austin laughs]


           Keith (as Bartel): Not a strong answer but, okay.


Austin: [still amused] No.


Keith: Um, so, I guess uh, I guess we're going up into the trees. And I wonder if there is any danger.


Austin: Do you think we get like a good just like, sequence of like, I'll give you an opportunity which is like, there's a series of vines to swing from, there's like, um, some st-- here's how I think we do it, here's my suggestion. I know it's not my turn. I'm giving you an opportunity, so it's not necessarily how we do it. My--there's a couple of ways I think that we could, we could go. I think--


Keith: Uh-huh.


Austin: --It's vines; there's some sort of sticky sap that we could put on our hands, and paws, to help us climb better; um, and there is something else that we could do... what's a third way to get up top really quick? Like a, something springy, or we could get a ride on something?


Keith: Oh well you find the right branch and you can, that's basically a trampoline.


Austin: Yeah, you got a trampoline branch, a swing, and sticky goo hands.


Keith: Yeah.


Austin: Those are our opportunities here, for sure.


           Art (as Stoffle): I think we should go with sticky hands.


           Keith (as Bartel): Yeah, that makes sense for you.


           Austin (as Katya): Should we all pick one that fits our style?


           Keith (as Bartel): Yeah, what was the third one? We got trampoline, we got sticky hands, and then...


           Austin (as Katya): [cross] The vines.


           Art (as Stoffel): [cross]There was a Winnie the Pooh style... [cross] um, no the trampoline...


Austin: [cross] No the trampoline is the Winnie the Pooh. Um... yeah.


Keith: 'Sticky hands' is also pretty Winnie the Pooh.


Austin: True.
           (as Katya): He is fictional. Not real.


           Keith (as Bartel): I'm gonna say my style is trampoline branches.


Austin: How's that... that feels uncertain but not necessarily dangerous, so... Um, I would say, based on my gut instinct, that you make it up.


Keith: Okay.


Austin: Yeah, I feel like that's a Bartel thing to do.


Keith: Yeah, I have climbing, it's one of my things. [cross] That I--


Austin: [cross] Oh? No? No, no, no.


Keith: [cross] Oh... No. I almost did. I remember...


Austin: [laughs] Fair.


Keith: I'm remembering having almost--I forgot. It's the glade.


Austin: Yeah, I gotcha.


           Art (as Stoffle): Trampoline is like the opposite of climbing.


           Keith (as Bartel): Well you gotta climb up to get there, and you've got to scramble onto the next branch.


           Art (as Stoffle): I dunno I've never done it.


Austin: I am uh... I am using my--and y'all can tell me if this is dangerous or not--I am using my--or I'm not using my skill, because again I don't have to look at skills, I can just tell you what I'm doing, which is: it's not so much that I'm using the sticky--I have, I have a sticky hand and a sticky paw, and then I have a non-sticky hand and a non-sticky paw, and I'm using those to like stab into the tree and climb, and the sticky one is like my, my like... you know, [cross] it's like my safety net.


Keith: [cross] That one's for hugging and then the non-sticky one is for stabbing.


Austin: Right, you know what I mean?


Keith: Yeah.


Austin: Because sometimes the sticky one gets stuck to, like it takes a LOT of effort to pull the sticky one off, so I wanna have like a different one that I can...


Keith: We must have found an incredibly sticky thing.


Austin: It's the tree sap, it's the sap of... ooh!
           (as Katya): It's the Sap of Forgetfulness, ah... it's made, uh, [Art: Oh NO.]


[Keith laughs]


Austin: I think I've just made this dangerous for myself, FUCK. [laughs] Um... what happens, what's the Sap of Forgetfulness do to me?


Art: Well we were both using the sap.


Austin: [laughing] This is not good. Keith, Bartel, you have to tell us, is this dangerous, uncertain, both, and if so give us the, the rundown on what, uh, what that means. I'll paste these rules by the way into our internal chat, [Keith: Okay.] so you can just see what that process is.


Keith: I have the, uh, the thing open here, but I... don't have the page where it has [mumble] to do. Um... well it's definitely, it's definitely uncertain. [Austin: Yeah.] I don't, I don't know that this is dangerous, because you're just going to end up being more... more of the thing you already were.


Austin (in Katya's voice): More forgetful. Yeah. [Keith: More forgetful.]


Austin: So is that what it is, is that we get up there like, [in Katya's voice] "what a view," [regular voice] like I've forgotten what we're out here doing. [All three laughing.]


Keith: Right, the thing, you can't think more than one thing ahead.


           Art (as Stoffle): The forest is so beautiful from the edge of the glade!


           Keith (as Bartel): Guys!


           Austin (as Katya): My lovely lovely nephew, I am so glad we took this family trip to see the wonder of [Keith as Bartel: Guys!] nature and of all things.


           Keith (as Bartel): Hey!


           Austin (as Katya): [cross] Who is th...


           Art (as Stoffle): [cross] Why are we being yelled at?


           Austin (as Katya): Who is this ferret? [Keith as Bartel: Hey!] Who... hello ferret!


           Keith (as Bartel): C'mon!


           Austin (as Katya): Hello to you!


           Keith (as Bartel): No, I said c'mon! Come here!


           Austin (as Katya): They must have [Art as Stoffle: No!] [Keith as Bartel: Let's go!] a local greeting... come on! Come on! Hello, come on to you too!


           Keith (as Bartel): No, it's this way!


           Austin (as Katya): Hello! [laughing] Oh little ferret... he's a cute little ferret.


Keith: Okay, this is dangerous.


Austin: [laughs] Alright if it's dangerous, how have we made ourselves vulnerable?


Keith: Uh, you have made yourselves vulnerable by putting ON the thing you were trying to avoid, [Austin laughs] and forgetting everything--you've forgotten who, who I am.


Austin: It's pretty dangerous!


Keith: It's pretty, that's pretty dangerous! [cross] And I don't know... what am I gonna do...


Art: [cross] I think being this forgetful on the top of a tree is pretty dangerous, just in itself. [Austin, laughing: Just generally!] Just like ope, time to go!


Keith: Yeah I'm... Hey I'm gonna take a step left, I'm sure that I'm on the ground right now. And I can't just be like "let's go inside and wash your hands in the sink."


Austin: Right, true.


Keith: How are you gonna get this off?


Austin: Is this now both dangerous and uncertain? [Keith: Yes.] If so, then tell us how the situation escalates and becomes worse.


Keith: Huh... well, I guess there's two ways. It could be... it could be that there's, you know, even more of a forgetful thing, or that there's some sort of threat that you're just now totally unprepared to deal with.


Austin: Let's go with that one. What's the threat up here on the top of the canopy of the Glades of Forgetfulness?


Keith: I don't know. I, mm...


Austin: [typing] What is on top of like, forest canopies?


Art: Birds, right? [cross] I mean it's...


Austin: [cross] It's birds, right. We've already done, we've already done owls. Is there another?...


Keith: What if it's something that's so big that it's looking at us while we're on the top of the canopy.


Art: What about one of them mountain turtles?


Keith: What are, this is, this is someone's sap that they're... cultivating.


Austin: Ohhhh, right.


Art: For forgetful pancakes.


Keith: Yeah.


Austin: Delicious, delicious.


Art: The pancakes are so good they make you forget all your troubles.


Keith: Well maybe if you're a big giant thing, maybe if you're some kind of Pine Warden, then it doesn't matter that it makes you forget a little bit. It's like... for him it's just like an edible.


Austin: Is this giant... yeah. That's exactly what I had, it's just like: when you say the Pine Warden, are you saying that like this is basically a forest ranger giant turtle who just like, who eats these edibles all day, and just kinda makes sure this part of the woods is chill?


Keith: I didn't say turtle, but we can do turtle.


Austin: That's what Art said, Art said a giant turtle. Right Art, didn't you?


Art: Yeah, one of those turtles that's like a mountain? Where you think it's a mountain but it's a big turtle?


Austin: But it's actually a big turtle.


Keith: Oh, so like the hill to the left raises its head and looks... that's the best like, [cross, unintelligible]


Austin (in a deep, slow Pine Warden voice): [cross] You have gotten into my stash! [regular voice] Right, uh-huh.


Keith: The Pine Warden can change size.


Austin: Yeah, that's one of the powers of being a Pine Warden, sure.


Art: It's part of the Pine Warden package.


Austin: Yeah. Um...
           (as Katya): Hello, Pine Warden. You look good today. I hope your family is well.


Keith: Oh is the, the Pine Warden is so big now that, is so big that people, like everyone just knows the Pine Warden?


Austin: You have to know the Pine Warden!


Art: [cross] Yeah, how do you not know the Pine Warden?


Keith: [cross] Or are you bluffing?


Austin: I think this is me calling on my history as a Spearbearer, I think as part of the training is you learn a few, you learn hey, the Owls run this part of town, or this part of the forest, the Sweet Frogs are over here, this big Pine Warden turtle is over here. You probably have to meet the Pine Warden as part of your... huh what'd you say?


Keith: We're so focused today!


Austin: We're making up for last time when it was a fucking mess. It was a beautiful mess! People should go listen to the last one. Lily in the chat saying that they haven't heard the last one, you should go back, Lily. You should go back and listen to the last Live, it was a nightmare, it was beautiful. Um, um yeah! I think as being a Spearbearer, part of the training is you have to go out to the Pine Baron, or the Pine--not the Pine Baron, the Pine WARDEN... the Pine Baron is, of course...


Keith: Oh you do NOT want to go meet the Pine Baron!


Austin: Exactly! The Pine Baron are what the Wardens are here to guard us against.


Keith: I'm crossing myself that the Pine Baron doesn't show up.


Austin: If the Pine Baron shows up that would take us from dangerous to something else entirely. But is the Warden mad at us because we're stealing his, his sap?


Art: I don't know, "mad" feels a little strong, but like, you wouldn't want someone in your, your sap garden, or whatever.


Keith: Yeah.


Austin: Getting fur in there.


Keith: Yeah, at some point I think you're big and old and scary enough that it doesn't even matter if you're mad or not for it to be dangerous?


Austin: Right, right. Um...


Keith: [cross] Like one thoughtless swipe of the fin...


Austin: [cross]  Can you be the, can you be this, this Pine Warden for us Keith? Since we're the ones in trouble and Bartel is safe?


Keith: Yeah, yeah I can do that. Hold on.


[beeping noise]


Austin: [cross] Was that... is Keith calling?..


Art: [cross] Does Keith have an effect? Is he gonna come back with like...


Austin: Yeah, some sort of... some sort of modulated voice.


           Keith (voice modulated to be deep and echoing, as the Pine Warden): Hello.


           Austin (as Katya): Hello, uh, Pine Warden. Thank you for letting us use uh, your sap, as sticky glue to climb the trees. I wanted to--this is my nephew, Stoffle. Stoffle, say hello, to the Pine Warden.


           Art (as Stoffle, nervous): Hello, hello Pine Warden. [cross] Please don't call the Baron.


           Keith (as Pine Warden): [cross] My sap. [pause] I don't need the Baron.


           Austin (as Katya): Yes.


           Art: (as Stoffle): That's right.


           Keith (as Pine Warden): You've disturbed my syrup.


           Austin (as Katya): No, we did not touch your syrup. We, uh, this is sap. Syrup is a different thing.


           Art (as Stoffle, quietly): That's good. This will work.


           Austin (as Katya): [chuckles] Yes it will.


           Keith (as Pine Warden): Hm. Not syrup.


           Austin (as Katya): No! No no no... I would n--we--Stoffle! Stoffle is chef! Stoffle would never steal syrup, Stoffle?


           Art (as Stoffle): Yeah, this, this doesn't even, [lip smacking sounds] this doesn't even taste good? [more lip smacking]


Austin: [laughing] Forgetting new things by the second!
           (as Katya): No, see--


           Keith (as Pine Warden): Badger. Small badger. You're a chef. How do you make syrup?


           Art (as Stoffle): I have a syrup guy? I just fill out the order form and they bring syrup.


           Austin (as Katya): This is why. This is why.


           Art (as Stoffle): Hold on, I know a song about it. [singing to the tune of "Only Time"] Who can say how to make syrup? No one can. It's a mystery. [Austin and Keith as the Pine Baron laugh.]


Austin: Alright you gotta roll your singing here. [laughing] I will help if you need it after the case. When you roll, pick one of your skills that feels like it could help you in the situation. Roll a number of six-sided dice equal to that skill's dot rating and take the highest. You have a one in singing. On a six describe how you turn a situation to your favor despite the odds, on a four to five you describe how you turn the situation to your favor and the threat is resolved but a friend gets to say what factor complicates your situation. Let's not talk about the three or minus because, because it just won't happen, you're gonna get a four a five or a six.


Austin: Hey that's a five!


Art: That's a five!


Austin: So, uh, Keith, can you give us a complication. The complication lists are: it takes extra time, the danger hasn't completely left you, you are wounded, you become completely lost, some new danger is stalking you, you leave behind something precious to you.


Keith: Huh. Good question.


Austin: Yeah. Agreed.


Keith: Well, yeah, it's tough because I don't think we've resolved the forgetfulness.


Austin: No, but maybe the Warden part seems to be resolved, potentially.


Keith: Right. Well, he laughed at the singing.


Austin: Yeah! So is this now, what is the, so is this just "the danger hasn't completely left you" because the Warden part of the danger has left us but the forgetfulness is still here, basically.


Keith: Yeah... you know what it is? I think that it's gotta be... "you become completely lost" is one of them, [Austin: Mm, yeah.] but the other one is "it takes extra time." Because I think maybe the Pine Warden is like [unmodulated Pine Warden voice] "no, you must come and dine with me."


Austin: Right, right.


Keith: Because you made him laugh and so he's like...


Austin: Can I get another take of that but from the Pine Warden?


           Keith (as Pine Warden with modulated voice): You must come and dine with me.


           Austin (as Katya): Oh, Stoffle this is good. Stoffle this is connections. Connections is how you make, uh, restaurant empire.


           Art (as Stoffle): Yeah. We could get another location out here.


           Austin (as Katya): FRANCHISING.


           Keith (as Pine Warden): I'm looking for wholesalers for my syrup.


           Austin (as Katya): Yes, see?


           Art (as Stoffle): Yes!


           Austin (as Katya): We will bring them to ALL of the different townships, none of which I can quite remember right now.


Art: I can't believe we have these notes and [laughing] none of them include any of the information on the hamlets.


Austin: They're untitled--they're the United Hamlets. [laughing] I said the "untitled" hamlets, which is what I'm calling them now. [typing] Untitled, question mark?


Keith: Well the song is called the Untitled Hamlet Song.


Austin: Right.
           (as Katya): We will of course come to dinner. Can my nephew, brilliant chef Stoffle, help to prepare a meas--a meal, a measly meal, for you?


           Art (as Stoffle): It's gonna be a g--don't you worry, it's gonna be a fine meal.


           Keith (as Pine Warden): Is it a good meal or a measly meal?


           Austin (as Katya): Measly in scale compared to your greatness, which is vast, and round, and shell-like, in nature.


           Keith (as Pine Warden): Well when I eat I normally shrink.


           Austin (as Katya): Oh okay, well then, not so measly.


           Keith (as Pine Warden): Yeah.


           Art (as Stoffle): When you go back big is it like you didn't eat anything at all or does the food get big with you?
        
0:23:57.2        
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Well... huh. I didn't... I... uh...
Austin (as Katya):        You think —
Keith:        It just get big with me. I guess food get big.
Austin (as Katya):        Food get big, yeah.
Art (as Stoffle):        Food big, got it.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        I mean, at least I'm not hungry.
Art (as Stoffle):        That's all that matters.
Austin (as Katya):        Let us —
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Okay, I'm shrinking now.
Austin (as Katya):        We will — wait, wait, wait, wait! If you could stay —
Keith (as Pine Warden):        [blubbering]
Austin (as Katya):        That's — you're a little bigger than you were, actually, now.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Yeah, sorry.
Austin (as Katya):        A bit, a bit too big.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        I crushed something... under my leg.
Austin (as Katya):        Eeh... uh-oh. If you could stay, uh, a little big, so we could find you, in the woods, it would help.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Mmm.
Austin (as Katya):        A landmark, a... there he is, the Pine Warden. Let's go to him.
Keith:        Right, he like, pops down smaller, but you can still see a shell peeking over the, the trees.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        How's that?
Austin (as Katya):        It's perfect.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Great.
Art (as Stoffle):        I hope we remember where we're going when this is over.
Austin (as Katya):        We just have to sing ourselves a song, so that we remember, uh... you know, going to the Pine Warden's house.
Art (as Stoffle):         Mmm.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        I don't know the words to that one.
Austin (as Katya):        Who is this ferret?
Art (as Stoffle):        I have no idea.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        It's me, Bartel. I'm your guide.
Austin (as Katya):        To, to the Pine — ah, Stoffle, the Pine Warden, he sent us a guide, to lead us —
Art (as Stoffle):        That is so thoughtful!
Austin (as Katya):        What a thoughtful, thoughtful Warden. Lead on, uh, uh, ferret guide. I'm sor — Bartel.
Art (as Stoffle):        Bartel, right.
Keith:        I, you know, I'd correct you, but I'd have to correct you again later. So let's just go.
Austin:        [laughing] Ah... all right. I think the focus changes here to Stoffle, since we're going to the Pine Warden's place and we're get intoing cooking some stuff.
Art:        Yeah, uh... we, we arrive at the, the Pine Warden's kitchen. I assume that we're all, like, you, you guys are, you two are going to be my brigade for this? This is the...
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Art:        Yeah, uh...
Austin:        Wait, what's the outside of the Pine Warden's house look like, what's the situation?
Art:        Well, we've sort of established that it's like, this is, this is where the Pine Warden is when the Pine Warden is, is little.
Austin:         Mmm.
Keith:        Yeah.
Austin:        So it's —
Keith:        I have an idea. Turtles... turtles don't, like, move shells.
Austin:        Right.
Keith:        But...
Austin:        But —
Keith:        I think this one does. I think that he lives in the husk of an older shell.
Austin:        Shell, right, sure.
Keith:        Someone, you know, someone that, maybe this is like the normal, like the neutral Pine Warden size.
Austin:        Right, right. Like bigger. Like a house-sized —
Keith:        Right.
Austin:        But not, not mountain-sized.
Keith:        Right. Big enough to, for it to be a, a —
Austin:        Yeah.
Keith:        I was going to say hovel, but it's not a hovel. It's a, a house.
Austin:        Is it — would you say that it's more of a cabin?
Art:        [laughing]
Austin:        Did you say a combine —
Keith:        I said condo.
Austin:        Condo. [laughing] Yeah. “ Welcome to my condo.”
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Welcome to my condo, I own...
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        Is there parking?
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Two spaces.
Art and Austin:        Wow!
Everyone:        [laughing]
Austin:        All right. So yeah, kitchen now.
Art:        Yeah.
Art (as Stoffle):        What... what does the Pine Warden eat?
Austin (as Katya):        He is a turtle, so... bug... grass.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Well, my favorite thing for me to make for myself is waffles in a homemade syrup.
Austin (as Katya):        Oh...
Art (as Stoffle):        Can he hear us in here?
Austin (as Katya):        I guess... wardens have good ears.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        I hear all things in my domain.
0:28:11.8        
Austin (as Katya):        I —
Art:        HOA must be furious.
Keith:        [laughs]
Austin (as Katya):        Then we must choose our words very carefully, Stoffle.
Art (as Stoffle):        Yes. Yeah, don't say, “fuck the Pine Warden.”
Austin (as Katya):        No! I meant more like we should not say... that I think the Pine Warden is dreamy, or that I have a big crush... for instance.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        I heard that!
Austin (as Katya):        Ho-ho-ho-ho. Oh...
Art and Keith:        [laughing]
Austin (as Katya):        You caught me. [pause] Stoffle.
Austin:        I gesture to like, the kitchen, as if like, “do the thing you do.”
Art (as Stoffle):        Yeah, I know how to make waffles!
Austin:        Uh... how do you make waffles? What's the, what's the situation? Pitch me these waffles.
Art:        Uh... I mean, *I don't know how to make waffles.
Austin:        Oh, boy.
Keith:        You don't know how to make waffles?
Austin:        Don't know how to make waffles?! He doesn't know how to make waffles!
Keith:        Art doesn't know how to make waffles, pass it on!
Austin:        Did you hear?
Art:        I don't know, is it like pancakes, is, is waffle batter like pancake batter?
Keith:        It's, it is the same — it's the exact same thing, yeah.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Art:        All right. So we get our forest Bisquick —
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        And, put some eggs and milk in it. [chuckles]
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Art:        Then we get in there with a whisk.
Austin:        [cross] You've got to whisk it up. Uh-huh.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        Is there an iron? What's the, what's the like, cool fantasy waffle iron look like?
Art:        Uh... like, I sort of want to go in just Tolkien direction, which is the like —
Keith:        Oh, his waffle irons were great.
Art:         What's that?
Keith:        His waffle irons were great.
Art:        Yeah, uh-huh. Who can forget? When... ah, I wish I could remember all those other names those jerks had.
Keith:        Gimli...
Art:        But like, remember that like, Gimli's not like the — oh, that's not for Gimli, but like the hobbits, they're not their real names?
Austin:        Yeah, we — yeah. Uh-huh. We've gone down this road.
Art:        Uh-huh. I just wish I had that for this joke, and I don't. Uh... so it's like, a waffle iron that's like the size of 1 and a half waffle irons —
Austin:         Yes.
Art:        That you or I might know of. And it's just intricately patterned with these forest themes, and the waffles come out with this like indented foliage.
Austin:        Ooh.
Art:        And it's like —
Keith:        You get like a bas relief waffle iron.
Art:        And it's made of like, mithril, and...
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        Jewels, and it heats so evenly.
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        Because of... elven magic, or whatever.
Austin:        Right, of course. Uh... I think —
Keith:        I like how this is the most traditional fantasy thing we've had by far, is this waffle iron.
Austin:        Ever in Friends at the Table? Yeah. Uh-huh. We finally got to high fantasy, and —
Austin and Keith:        And it's this waffle iron [both laughing].
Art:        Let me tell you, it's a plus-2 to waffles over here.
Austin:        It is... oh, see, here's the thing I'm going to say, to make it more Friends at the Table, is, I think it's too fucking fancy. This is like, you've been using a percolator your whole life, and now you've got in front of you an espresso machine. And you're like... you put, don't you just put the waffle shit in there, and then it go? [laughing] what is this? Uh... so I think it's, I don't know that you — I think we have a roll.
Art:        Wait, there's no “go” button? [chuckles]
Austin:        Yeah, there's no go button. Uh, you don't know the elvish for [laughing] for go, so —
Art:        [cracking up]
Austin:        So you can't really...
Keith:        Oh yeah, it doesn't even, it doesn't even get hot unless you, unless you figure out how to tell it to get hot.
Art:        Yeah, it says speak, speak cook and waffs — on it —
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        In some language we don't speak.
Austin:         Ah...
Art:        We need, uh...
Keith:        Oil by step one.
Art:        We need Gandalf the sous chef to come by.
Austin:        Great. Uh... sorry, I'm trying to think if there's like a rhyme that we could do here, like a Gandalf the [blank], and it's not happening
Art:        I tried, and I couldn't, I couldn't get there.
Austin:        Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I gotcha. Uh... what, uh,, what are you, how are you going to —
Keith:        Gandalf the Wheat... flour.
Austin:        Mmm... it's closer.
Art:        Gandalf the Grey....t chef.
Austin:        That's it. That's it. We got it. Don't worry about it, everybody. We got it, we can go home. [laughing]
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin:         Thanks for joining us here...
Art:        Uh, as always, Friends at the Table —
Austin:        Yeah, dot cash. [chuckles] Uh... give me, what is this roll, what are, what are you, what are we doing? How are you, how are you going to overcome your, your unfamiliarity with this?
Art:        Oh, I don't have any cooking skills — I have eating.
Austin:        Yeah, because you're a gourmand. You're not [laughing] a chef.
0:33:06.2        I don't know how we got here, but you're not a chef.
Art:        Well, my signature dish is —
Keith:        You know, I feel like we [unintelligible]
Art:        Pretty pathetic.
Austin:        It is. We, I just want to emphasize that you skipped cook, the first class in the game, [chuckling] for gourmand.
Keith:        [chuckling] Well, it was always been gourmand and beekeeper.
Austin:        You're right. Cook was never in the mix.
Art:        Yeah, I don't even remember seeing cook.
Austin:        Right. Yeah.
Keith:        The fact, I mean, and then I, I feel like we've telegraphed that, uh... Stoffle might not be that great of a chef.
Austin:        Yeah, we have, we have done that, that's true. You could always spend a rascality here, as a reminder. When you spend rascality you can do a bunch of different things. You can resist a complication with three rascality. You can act on a sliver of hope with three rascality, which is, where you get to pick one of the -L options from the hope list, which I pasted in our internal chat.
0:34:02.0        It happens, and you get to say how. You can do this at any time, whether or not you're rolling. Note, you cannot choose to restore your rascality buy spending three rascality. [chuckles] Uh, you can push yourself, obviously, and you can help someone. Which, I'm happy to help you on this roll by spending rascality, but I need to, but, you know, I don't know, do you have an idea here? Do you have a hope that could maybe, you could buy with three rascality?
Art:        Yeah, I would like the waffle maker to reveal a weakness to me.
Austin:        Ooh, good. What is it, what is it — Keith, do you have any ideas here? What is the, what is the way in for our, for the person who only has eating, smelling, and beekeeping? Maybe it — [laughing] maybe it has like, bee language? There's like a, on the bottom side, underneath, inscribed, is, “if you only know bee... here is...”
Keith:        Well, when you turn the waffle — because a waffle iron has to turn.
Austin:        Right. It does turn. And so when you turn it, the other side has instructions in, in Beese. Which has [chuckling] the language of Bee. B-E-E-S-E. Uh, which means that you could use beekeeping to do this, instead. I think that is the way in which there is a weakness.
Art:        So that's three rascality?
Austin:        Yeah, [chuckles] three rascality.
Art:        All right, I'm just going to drag 'em over here to the bottom.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Art:        All right, I'm going beekeeping.
Austin:        Which is 1.
Art:        Oh, hey, I'm missing...
Austin:        No, no, no — you've spent. You're not missing, you've spent.
Art:        Okay. [roll20 boop]
Austin:        Hey, that's a 5. Do you want to —
Art:        All I roll are 5s.
Austin:        No matter what.
Art:        No matter what.
Austin:        Uh... [sucks teeth]I think you might get wounded. Here is the complication I'm offering. It's really [laughing] hot. It's made for elves and bees, and you are a badger. [chuckles] Uh... and so I think we get like, you make beautiful waffles. They're gorgeous. But if you accept this wound — some effects might cause you to become wounded. When you are wounded, if you would spend rascality, you must instead spend that much rascality plus one.
Art:        Okay. I will, I will accept being wounded —
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Art:        And I will say that I just didn't find the proper magic...
Austin:        Ah...
Art:        Potholders.
Austin:        Right. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense to me.
Art:        That makes sense to me.
Keith:        You found the potholders but you couldn't tell how to active them.
Art:        Yeah, I could — like, my, my hands wouldn't fit. And like, it's clearly like, they're big enough, but there's like a trick to —
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        I didn't know the elvish for, “don't get burned.”
Austin:        Uh... I'm marking your sheet as... wounded. Boom.
Austin (as Katya):        All right. Now we must present the... the waffles. To the Warden. Warden, act along, so you can be surprised. My nephew has worked very hard.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Hm. [clears throat] Mmm?
Austin (as Katya):         Stoffle, show him what you've made.
Art (as Stoffle):        Um, today we have... uh, a plate of waffles.
Austin (as Katya):        Mmm — [whispering] Stoffle's... waffles.
Art (as Stoffle):         Stoffle's —
Art:        Wink.
Austin (as Katya):         Stoffle's —
Art (as Stoffle):         Stoffle's waffles.
Austin (as Katya):        [becoming more and more excited] Yes. Yes. Yes! [laughing]
Art (as Stoffle):        A food cart, do we have —
Austin (as Katya):        And this is good! This is — [laughing]
Art (as Stoffle):        A wonderful prospectus we could show you. [chuckling]
Austin (as Katya):        And?
Art (as Stoffle):        And... syrup.
Austin (as Katya):        Ahem. Not just — not, not just syrup.
Art:        Hold on, I was looking for a name pun and I couldn't come up with one.
Austin (as Katya):        They are... it is...
Art (as Stoffle):        May-Bartel's syrup [very bad maple syrup pun attempt]
Austin (as Katya):        I, I —
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Oh... the ferret helped with the syrup?
Art (as Stoffle):        The... the... the ferret — brought the syrup.
Austin (as Katya):        The mysterio helped with... [chuckling] mystery syrup!
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin:        I'm doing the hand thing, like, my, my, fingers are waggling. Willferret4 in the chat says, “ Stofflehouse.” Thank you.
Art:        That's good, yeah.
Austin:        Yeah, mm-hm.
Austin (as Katya):        And, and, and also there is... to drink — ahem, Stoffle?
Art (as Stoffle):        Uh... to drink, we have a wonderful selection of beverages that you already had!
Austin (as Katya):        But, but we mixed them in new and exciting ways.
Art (as Stoffle):        So like, where you had seltzer and milk... now you have an egg cream!
Austin (as Katya):        It is good. A better name than I had. I had, uh, “sprinkly cow.”
Keith (as Pine Warden):        I'm... sorry to tell you this, but that is not what an egg cream is.
Art (as Stoffle):        Isn't it?
Keith (as Pine Warden):        No.
Austin (as Katya):        Is close.
Art:        Isn't it... isn't it milk and seltzer and like some chocolate?
Keith:        Yeah, it, it has chocolate syrup in it.
Art:        Yeah, that's in there. I, I — [unintelligible]
Keith:        Milky, bubbly water...
Austin (as Katya):        You're not focusing on the main thing. The main thing is bubble, is bubble milk.
Art (as Stoffle):        Bubble milk? [chuckles]
Austin (as Katya):        Fizzy, fizzy drinking milk.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        You're right, that's not as catchy.
Austin (as Katya):        See? Egg cream. So...?
Art (as Stoffle):        Water... cream.
Austin (as Katya):        Is no water? Is there — is, is water. I forgot water.
Art (as Stoffle):        There's no egg.
Keith:        Well, seltzer is — seltzer is water.
Austin (as Katya):        Ahem... mmm —
Austin:        And produces an egg from my back pocket. And cracks it, and adds it to, the to [chuckling] seltzer, to the seltzer milk.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Ah, now it's an egg cream. [laughing]
Austin:        Uh, I stir it up —
Austin (as Katya):        Is special.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Don't break the yolk.
Austin (as Katya):        No, I... soft stir. You've heard soft-serve. Stoffle — soft-serve. Stir-ve.
Keith (as Pine Warden):         Stoffle soft, soft-stir.
Austin (as Katya):         Stoffle stu- stu- sta- stir.
Art (as Stoffle):        Stu-stof-stil-stirfs.
Austin (as Katya):        Sofl-sa-sirf.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Stofl soft-stirs.
0:40:34.1        
Austin (as Katya):        Exact — exactly. Yes. Now, if you would eat, we would be honored.
Keith:        Hm. I see you've made me my usual breakfast.
Austin (as Katya):        Your favorite breakfast. [pause] And in exchange, you can, uh... uh... give my nephew, brilliant, bright, uh, prodigy of the kitchen, a second restaurant.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        I think this is dangerous.
Austin (as Katya):        Why?
Keith:        Uh... I think Stoffle has potentially made a garbage meal.
Austin:        [laughing] Listen, Stoffle passed that previous check.
Keith:        Okay. All right.
Austin:        I think, there could be danger here. I don't think it can be that — because — wounded —
Keith:        Well, passed the previous check but then handed me water, milk, and raw egg.
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        Uh... excuse me — Caught ya [unintelligible]
Austin:        [laughing] it was just stirred. Caught ya! [laughing] Yeah, that's me. Uh... uh, [wheezes laughing]
Austin (as Katya):        What if, before, before you eat and drink, we also have one last, uh, gift. Uh, gracious —
Keith (as Pine Warden):        You said one less gift?
Austin (as Katya):        One last.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Are you taking away one of these gifts?
Austin (as Katya):        One last! Gift. Warden. Is dinner? Hm? And a show. Ahem. [badly singing] Who could say, what a waffle is? Not little Stoffle-is... [chuckles] I don't know...
Austin:        Sing it. I'm rolling sing for this.
Art (as Stoffle):        [also singing badly] Who can know, what breakfast should, be? Is it sweet or savory-yyyy —
Austin (as Katya):        [laughing] yyyyyy.
Austin:        Uh, I'm going to roll singing, and see if we can, we can save this disaster, by singing a song about all of the ingredients in this meal. My favorite part.
Art:        And the ways in which, if it's bad, who even knows if that's —
Austin:        Right! Exactly!
Art:        What breakfast is?
Austin:        Who even knows what breakfast is? I'm rolling 2D6 for my singing, uh... that's a 4. That's a, that's a complication. I, what is the complication? Tell me what this complication is. We've finished the song, we've — this is the first song we've ever really written by ourselves...
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        Uh, and —
[knocking noises]
Art:        Goddammit. Sorry, someone's here painting my house.
Austin:        Oh, okay. [chuckling] I thought this was a bit, I thought it was like, someone, the complication is, someone has knocked on the door.
Art:        No, no —
Keith:        [laughing]
Keith:        It's the Pine Baron, the Pine Baron's here.
Austin:        [laughing] yeah, I mean — “I heard there was good food here! I'm here for the good Stoffles!” [chuckling]
Keith:        Oh my god, we have got to get out of here, this is the —
Art:        That can be the new danger, [unintelligible]
Austin:        That's the new — I'm set. Let's do it.
Art:        And you're going for a Colonel Sanders voice for the —
Austin:        [chuckling] Yeah, the — [southern accent] “the Pine Baron, is me. I've shown up —“
Keith (as Pine Warden):        The Pine Baron is you. The Pine Warden is me.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Hello, Pine Warden. I would like to gain entry, to where I've heard the good food is.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Will it be like last time?
Art (as Stoffle):        You've come to the right place.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        It will be just like last time.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Then you may enter.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Ha-ha-ha! Oh, who are these little badgers, then?
Austin:        Also, what is the Pine Baron? We have to decide what the baron — oh, it's a bear. It's a big bear [chuckling] obviously.
Keith:        [laughing] Right.
Art:        Is it a bear that can —
Keith:        A large bear called the baron.
Austin:        Yeah, it's a [laughing] bear that can get bigger or smaller, also.
Keith:        [laughing]
Art:        But is always just a little too big.
Austin:        Always just a little too big. Here, I actually found it. If you search — [gasps laughing] if you search for “bear colonel,” you'll get a honey — a bear — [wheezes laughing] you'll get a honey bear, like one of those honey bears, like where you put honey in the bear, like it's a condiment dispenser. Like a bottle. Uh, but it's dressed up like —
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin:        But it's [chuckling] dressed up like —
Keith:        [more laughter]
Austin:        It's perfect.
0:44:58.3        Uh... I have to get this link over here so that the stream can see what I'm talking about.
Keith:         That's very funny.
Austin:        Perfect. It's very good. I'm sure this is from some KFC thing, I don't care. It's ours now. Uh, come on in, uh, uh, and just big, hefty, just plops down on the ground, scratches, scratches his but.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        All right. Now, little badgers, and uh, and uh, a great, mysterious ferret.
Austin:        I've lost the voice, I've found a new voice. This is the wrong voice, where was it? It was, uh...
Keith:        It was raspier.
Austin:        It was, was it raspier?
Keith:        Yeah.
Austin:        It was, uh...
Austin (as Pine Baron):         The Pine Baron! He's here!
Keith:        Yeah. That's —
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Yeah, he's back here. All right! So, someone tell me what we're having for din — for dinner-breakfast, for brinner.
0:45:50.1        
Art (as Stoffle):        We have Stoffles and syrup, and egg — egg creams.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Some egg-egg creams. You got a little protein —
Art (as Stoffle):        Doubled the egg!
Austin (as Pine Baron):        I just need to know there's a little protein to go with that. Because I need a little bit of, uh, I don't mind if it's gamey, I don't — I just need a little meat, with my pudding, you know what I'm saying.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Technically, the egg is protein.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        I, but I need —
Art (as Stoffle):        It's pre-meat!
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Could you, could you mix it up good, so it's meat-meat?
Art (as Stoffle):        You want me to mix up the... egg?
Keith:        [laughing]
Art (as Stoffle):        Until they're chickens?
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Now, listen. I don't know where you come from. Y'all look like them Hamlet types. You know what I'm saying, city folk. But round here we got magic, and with a little magic, you put a wand in an egg cream, you mix it up — what you get? You get a chicken cream. Chicken cream pie.
Art:        [chuckling]
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Now you take that little egg-egg cream back in the kitchen, you turn that into a, you turn that into a chicken cream pie, and maybe, you can go about your business here, here in the Pine Barony.
Art (as Stoffle):        Okay — I presume that there's, there's, we can expect to find a magic wand in the kitchen?
Austin (as Pine Baron):        That's more of a question for the Warden.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Oh, sorry, yes. Self-explanatory. That's where we keep the — wands, is the kitchen.
Art (as Stoffle):        Great. Be right back, let's all get to the kitchen, friends!
Austin (as Katya):        Can the... can Baron hear everything we say, also?
Austin (as Pine Baron):        No, definitely not! Can't hear a word!
Austin (as Katya):        Well, this is no good.
Art (as Stoffle):        Suspicious.
Austin (as Katya):        This is not good.
Austin:        [chuckles] Uh...
Art:        Okay, what do we the think the magic wand will — I mean, if it's just a kitchen item, like it's just in a drawer?
Austin (as Katya):        F-f-ferret. Do you know, uh, what is, what is wand here?
Keith (as Bartel:        What is wand here?
Austin (as Katya):        Yes.
Keith:        Okay. Uh, I reach into, there's a, there's a like, a, it's not a vase, but you know how some people have like a big cup that they keep wooden spoons and spatulas and stuff in?
0:47:57.1        
Austin:        Yeah, yeah. I like it being a vase, though.
Keith:        Okay, but this one is a vase. This one is a —
Austin:        Yeah.
Keith:        An expensive-looking vase. Uh, and in and amongst the slotted spoon and the metal spatula is, uh, like 3 or 4 different-sized wands.
Austin (as Katya):        How do we know which is good? Which is good, is chicken wand? We need chicken wand?
Art (as Stoffle):        Is there like... dried egg on any of them?
Austin (as Katya):        Ew. Ew, that is, that is gross, Stoffle. Do you really think the Pine Warden would not wash his wands? You've insulted him.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        I always wash my wands thoroughly.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes. See? Of course.
Art (as Stoffle):        All right, well...
Austin (as Pine Baron):        I do not! I like a dirty wand.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        You like a dirty wand? That's nasty.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Ha-ha! You know it. [chuckles] Having a good time! With magic.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Good time being nasty.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Ha-ha!
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin:        Uh, I think one of us has to decide which wand to get. I think this is, this is an obstacle, for sure.
Art:        Yeah. Uh... I don't know what the deal with the check is, though.
Keith:        Biggest one. It's the biggest one.
Austin (as Katya):        We shall, we shall take biggest wand?
Keith (as Bartel):        Yes.
Art:        Oh, is this, is this a smelling check? Could I try to see if —
Austin:        Oh! Yes.
Art:        Any of them smell like eggs, or chickens —
Austin:        Yeah, this is —
Art:        Or eggs turning into chicken?
Austin:        [laughing] This is a smelling check, for sure.
Art:        All right, I'm going to roll smelling.
Austin:        You've got a 1 in smelling. 1D6, gets us...
Art:        Ah, it's taking a while.
Austin:        It doesn't want to show us. What's going on here, what's going on, roll20?
Art:        I don't know, it still says [roll20 boop] rolling the dice.
Austin:        Hey, that's a [laughing]
Keith:        Wow, another 5.
Austin:        Always 5s! Oh, lord. It's happening. Uh... Keith, do you have any thoughts on complications here?
Keith:        Uh... uh,, it takes, it takes extra time, because you have to smell all the wands.
Austin:        Yeah. Uh-huh. And you hear the grumble of the Pine Baron.
Art (as Stoffle):        Well see, this one smells like eggs, but this one smells like custard...
Austin:        [laughing]
Art (as Stoffle):        And custard is made of eggs!
Austin (as Katya):        Mmm.
Art (as Stoffle):        And this one... smells like hollandaise sauce.
Keith (as Bartel):        Wouldn't you want the one that smells like chicken? Because that would have been the last thing that it was?
Art (as Stoffle):        Well wouldn't you stop stirring, when it starts becoming chicken?
Keith (as Bartel):        I think you'd stop stirring once it's fully chicken.
Austin (as Katya):        And then it would smell like chicken, yes.
Art (as Stoffle):        But — we can't stir up a solid chicken!
Keith (as Bartel):        Maybe you can't.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        [knocking on door Foley] How are y'all doing in there? How is the, uh, the chicken cream pie coming along?
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Yes, this is taking longer than expected.
Austin:        Just like a big, like sloppy tongue, licking the lips of this bear. It's his lips, it's his — it's his tongue, to be clear. Not a different tongue, not a magic, free-floating tongue, which would be gross. Uh, uh, — he's like —
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Ah, I'm getting a little extra taste. I want a little something else. I want something, I want a little fire mixed in with my, my chicken cream pie.
0:51:10.7        I want a spicy chicken cream pie. If that's something y'all could do for me.
Art (as Stoffle):        Uh...
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin (as Pine Baron):        You can pick the spices, but it's gotta be spicy.
Art (as Stoffle):        O — okay.
Austin (as Katya):        Mmm. Mm-hm.
Art (as Stoffle):        [whispering] What here looks like paprika?
Keith (as Bartel):        [laughing] There's — this fucking magic bear, saw a glass full of egg, sparkling water, and milk, and said, I want this to be spicy chicken.
Art and Austin:        [laughing]
Austin (as Pine Baron):        We live in a magical world, little ferret. The Pine Baron wants what the Pine Baron wants. And the world... provides. One way or another.
Art:        Uh...
Austin (as Katya):        Did that sound like a threat to anyone else? Because to me... it sounds, it sounds like threat.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Ha-ha!
Keith (as Bartel):        Pine Baron, was that a threat?
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Well, it was something.
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah, it was a threat.
Art (as Stoffle):        Yeah, it definitely sounds like a threat.
Austin (as Katya):        That was definitely a threat. All right, we need to find spice now, also.
Keith (as Bartel):        I think for a chicken cream pie [unintelligible]
Art (as Stoffle):        Spicy.
Austin (as Katya):        All right, we should all pick a spice in our heads. And then —
Keith (as Bartel):        Okay, got it.
Austin (as Katya):        When we, when we — you, you already have a spice? Throw that one out? We need new spices. We need to synchronize our spices.
Keith (as Bartel):        Okay.
Austin (as Katya):        And then, I will count, and when we hit 3, we will all say the spice at the same time.
Keith (as Bartel):        Okay.
Austin (as Katya):        Is this, are we in agreement?
Keith (as:        Is this 1, 2, 3, then say?
Austin (as Katya):        And then, and then the spice.
Art (as Stoffle):        Just anything with spicy, or like, something you would find in like a spice rack?
Austin (as Katya):        Is spice, is best — spice, if I said, hey, what is best spice, you would say blank, expect don't say blank until I say 1, 2, 3, that does not count.
Keith (as Bartel):        He said, “hottest.” He said —
Art (as Stoffle):        Well, he didn't say hot, he said he wants —
Austin (as Katya):        He said hot, but then he said spicy.
Keith (as Bartel):        Okay.
Austin (as Katya):        See, we could win on technicality.
Keith (as Bartel):        Hm...
Austin (as Pine Baron):        That's about right. I, I did say spicy. [laughing] I did. It's, you got me there.
Keith (as Pine Warden):        We would both, we would be forced to accept spicy — spices spicy, if that's what you gave us.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes. Yes, see, this is good. All right. So. Ahem. Are we ready? Do we all have one or not?
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah, I've got one.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Austin (as Katya):        1... 2... 3. Lavender.
Art (as Stoffle):        Saffron.
Keith (as Bartel):        [unintelligible] pepper.
Austin (as Katya):        Perfect. We will mix these three together. Lavender, saffron —
Austin:        I'm slipping into the other guy's voice.
Austin (as Katya):        Saffron, and what, what was it, ferret?
Keith (as Bartel):        Aleppo pepper.
Austin (as Katya):        What — what is that?
Keith (as Bartel):        It's a pepper from Aleppo.
Austin (as Katya):        Aleppo pepper. All right. Let's find these three —
Art. (as:        I could have sworn you said lemon pepper.
0:53:57.8        
Austin (as Katya):        Lemon pepper. A delicious lemon pepper [laughing] lavender, and saffron chicken cream pie.
Keith (as Bartel):        I, I, I wanna be clear. Saffron and lavender — not spices.
Austin (as Katya):        They are on this list. That I pulled up.
Keith (as Bartel):        Those are, those are herbs.
Austin (as Katya):        Those are herbs, they're close.
Art (as Stoffle):        They're in the spice rack, I mean, it's like —
Austin (as Katya):        In the spice rack.
Art (as Stoffle):        I mean, it's like oregano in your spice rack.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        This will not count, no. [chuckles] It's in the spice rack. That does not make it a spice.
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        It needs to be a spice. The only spice I heard there was the pepper one.
Keith (as Bartel):        Yep. That's spice.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Use that one.
Austin (as Katya):        All right. We'll use that one. I think you're missing out on the flavor profile, but... so it goes.
Austin:        I'm slipping French, now.
Art (as Stoffle):        Cumin? We can do cumin.
Austin (as Katya):        We could do cumin.
Austin:        Uh... like, going through all of the spices —
Austin (as Katya):        Not, I am not finding cumin. I am not finding 'leppo pepper or lemon pepper.
Keith (as Bartel):        No cumin... paprika.
Austin (as Katya):        Paprika. No.
Art (as Stoffle):        Yeah, paprika's a good one.
Austin (as Katya):        No. perhaps it is that the, the Pine Warden does not like spicy.
Keith (as Bartel):        Oh, is there maybe some fresh-cracked black pepper?
Austin (as Katya):        Simple. But, perhaps.
Keith (as Bartel):        It's a spice, and it is spicy.
Art (as Stoffle):        We could just jack it up with black pepper.
Austin (as Katya):        Oh, we could jack it up with black pepper. As much black —
Keith (as Bartel):        We could jack this thing up with black pepper.
Austin (as Pine Baron):        I do love a pepper.
Keith (as Bartel):        We've got two peppers in here. Pepper, and — pepper, black pepper, Aleppo pepper, and paprika.
Austin (as Katya):        And paprika. And bell pepper.
Keith (as Bartel):        Bell pepper.
0:55:44.3        
Austin (as Katya):        Cut it up.
Art (as Stoffle):        Cut up some bell peppers.
Austin (as Katya):        Yeah.
Keith (as Bartel):        What color?
Austin (as Katya):        All three. Four. Five. However many there are. I say three. Four? Is it four? Four.
Keith (as Bartel):        Well, there's three, but green is an unripened red one.
Austin (as Katya):        Right. Yes. And then yellow, and red, and orange. And green.
Art (as Stoffle):        Yeah. Yeah.
Austin (as Katya):        Those are the ones. Cut them all up. And maybe... other pepper?
Keith (as Bartel):        Pepper... uh... we could do, we could do pink? Pink peppercorns?
Austin (as Katya):        Pink peppercorns, yes.
Art (as Stoffle):        Chili peppers?
Keith (as Bartel):        They're not, they're not real peppercorns, but they are, they're fruity and they have a sort of peppery taste. Those are good.
Austin (as Katya):        I have important — I do not cooking. So it would be a procedural question. Do you add peppers before magic stir, or after?
Art (as Stoffle):        I think you have to do it before the magic stir, or it won't be incorporated.
Austin (as Katya):         Yes, yes. Yes.
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah, it would just be some peppercorn sitting on top of a chicken in a cup.
Austin:        So now we have, just in front of us, a big [chuckling] like vat of egg-egg cream, which is again, seltzer and milk and eggs, and so little chocolate that we didn't mention it to begin with.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        And then we've got Stoffle with the big chicken wand, which, we didn't determine what that looks like, what's that look like?
Art:        Uh... I think it's just like, it's the, it's, you know, like a wooden spoon, but if you didn't have the spoon part?
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Art:        And it was kind of like, carved with some lightning bolts. I think the chicken wand ended up having lightning bolts on it.
Austin:        Mm-hm.
Keith:        Lightning, for chicken.
Austin:        Yeah.
Art:        Mm-hm.
Austin:        Uh... and then we add — oh, I forgot the egg. There's also just an egg in there [chuckling], which we're not allowed to break the yolk on. And now we're stirring with the chicken wand. Uh... my gut is that this is uncertain. But I, again, don't know.
Keith:        Yeah, I think this is uncertain [unintelligible]
Austin:        You know what? I'm going to spend, I'm going to spend three rascality here. Uh... uh, and what it's going to do is, uh, find out some important information on our goal. I have a, I have a little trick here. Here's a little trick. Uh... I've spent my three rascality. While we're mixing it all together, I say —
Austin (as Katya):        Oh, do you know what else would be good? Is, uh, is, uh, honey. The Baron, notable fan of honey.
Austin:        And I reach up and grab a thing of honey, and on the back it says, “the cave — the cavern of bees.” And like —
Austin (as Katya):        [gasps] Stoffle. Stoffle. Do you remember?
Art (as Stoffle):        I... yes! Yes I do!
Austin (as Katya):        What are we doing? In kitchen?
Keith (as Bartel):        Oh, did you, did you still not remember that?
Art (as Stoffle):        I didn't remember anything!
Austin (as Katya):        Bartel!
Austin:        Big hug to Bartel. [laughing]
Austin (as Katya):        I have not seen you in... however long it has been! Since the frogs.
Keith (as Bartel):        Uh, we've been hanging out since we got to the Pine Warden's house.
Austin (as Katya):        Oh, we are at the Pine Warden's house! We're — Stoffle, this is an opportunity. We could...
Austin:        And Katya starts to blush a little bit, thinking about the Pine Warden, again for the first time. [chuckling]
Austin (as Katya):        Oh, I, I hope that the Pine Warden shows favor on us. Bartel, what are we doing in kitchen? What is, what is — have we not already — what is this?
Keith (as Bartel):        Uh, you were making the worst meal I've ever heard of.
Austin (as Katya):        For the Pine Warden?
Keith (as Bartel):        For the Pine Warden and the Pine Baron.
Austin (as Katya):        We have got to go!
Art (as Stoffle):        The Pine Baron is here?
Austin (as Katya):        We have to go now!
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Ha-ha-ha!
Keith (as Bartel):        You don't want to serve the food?
Austin (as Pine Baron):        No one's going anywhere!
Keith (as Bartel):        I wanted to serve you the food.
Austin (as Katya):        We — we, we... the Pine, the Pine Baron is very hungry.
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah, he can hear you.
Austin (as Katya):        [whispering] The Pine Baron is very hungry!
Austin (as Pine Baron):        I heard that, too.
Austin (as Katya):        [even smaller whisper] The Pine Baron is very hungry!
Austin (as Pine Baron):        Yes, I am!
Keith (as Pine Warden):        I, yeah, I heard that, too.
Art (as Stoffle):        Their hearing is like magic!
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Our hearing is like — it's literally magic.
Austin (as Katya):         [whispering] I have plan. I have plan. [normal voice] We are going to bring out the food, and not try to sneak away to the Cavern of Bees. Ahem. And we —
Keith (as Pine Warden):        Sounds good.
Austin (as Katya):        And we are going to do it under cover of song. Not cover, cover —
Keith (as Pine Warden):        You're going to cover a song.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes. This is, this is... yes. This is yes. This is yes. Is not — [laughing] there is no cover, because we are not sneaking away. We are coming to you with big plate of goo — what is this we cooked? What is this?
Art (as Stoffle):        [whispering] It's a chicken cream pie.
Keith:        [laughing] It's a spicy chicken cream pie.
Austin (as Katya):        We will be coming with [chuckles] the liquid, spicy, chicken cream pie.
Austin:        All right. Here is, here is, Katya is going to sing to provide people the necessary escape route from this very hungry bear, who is increasingly threatening. I think that is, that is Katya's play here. And it is going to be a cover. And she says —
Art (as Stoffle):        [singsong] Who could say what a pie is—
Austin (as Katya):        [singsong] could say where the road goes —
Austin:        [laughing] Yeah! Exactly. I'm going to give this two dice, and see if the bear sees through us. Hey, that's a 6! That's a 6. So in my mind, this is, literally, as we're walking away, Katya is raising here voice, as if to make it sound as if she's getting closer to them. So I start really quiet.
Austin (as Katya):        [quietly] Who can say what a pie is? I'm getting closer, with this pie... [laughing] I'll be right there with a pie. You can't wait to, eat this chicken cream.
Austin:        And then, out. Just, back, out a back window, and into the woods, away from the, the voracious Pine Baron, who was definitely going to eat us if that, if that scene continued much longer. Uh...
Austin (as Katya):        [out of breath] Not every day you run into Pine Baron and Pine Warden. I do not know why they are friends.
Keith (as Bartel):        They don't seem to have much in common.
Austin (as Katya):        No. Pines, mostly.
Keith (as Bartel):        Mmm.
Austin (as Katya):        Bartel, I'm sorry if we dragged you into bigger mess than you suspected.
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah, you absolutely have.
Austin (as Katya):        Apologies. Now that we have our wits, we can continue to bee... bee cave.
Keith (as Bartel):        You seemed to have an epiphany, a bee epiphany.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes.
Keith (as Bartel):        Back there.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes.
Keith (as Bartel):        You didn't — you just saw the word bee and kind of snapped out of it, you didn't —
Austin (as Katya):        No, the honey said, the honey said, “bee cave, bees,” and it [khwww] engine came up.
Keith (as Bartel):        Okay. It didn't say like, “visit the bee cave of bees!”
Austin (as Katya):        Yes. Yes, yes.
Keith (as Bartel):        You know, “it's 40 paces to the —“
Austin (as Katya):        It said, “visit the bee cave of bees. The wonder bee cave of wonders of bees. Is under the, the... the frosty peak.” Which I thought strange, because bees — do bees like cold? I did not expect.
Keith (as Bartel):        No, they get —
Art (as Stoffle):        I don't think bees do like cold.
Austin (as Katya):        Perhaps this is why they hide there, in the cave.
Art (as Stoffle):        Mmm, it's warm in the cave.
Austin (as Katya):        Is warm in cave. And also no one goes —
Keith (as Bartel):        It throws people off.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes. Yes. Good hiding spot.
Keith (as Bartel):        But then they sell... the honey...
Austin (as Katya):        The honey.
Keith (as Bartel):        That says, “come visit us there?”
Austin (as Katya):        Well, to buy the honey is... I suppose. Maybe only label for Pine Warden who, who they trust. And they say, “hey, Pine Warden, come visit us here.”
Keith (as Bartel):        And don't bring the Baron.
Austin (as Katya):        [chuckles] Do not bring the Baron, no.
Art (as Stoffle):        The Baron gets a honey jar that says that it's somewhere else.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes. So, I will lead, because, ahem, we are going to where it is cold, and I, I am good in cold.
Austin:        And, uh, begins to like, lead out from the forest towards, or I guess like deeper into the forest but a different part, where things do start to get colder, and it starts to get icy, a little bit, and there are some flurries, and soon you're in the snow, like a strange dream. You remember moments ago we were in the glades? Well now, it is snowing. [chuckles] Uh, and there is a peak, there is a, there is a mountain range in front of us. Uh, and somewhere under that peak, somewhere, is a cave of bees.
1:05:24.7        Uh...
Austin (as Katya):        Here we are. The mountain. Wondrous.
Keith (as Bartel):        It's so-ho-ho-ho cold here [shivering]
Austin (as Katya):        No, no, no. Is, is brisk. Ahem. Stoffle. Ahem
Art (as Stoffle):        Hm. Hm.
Keith (as Bartel):        Hm. Hm.
Austin (as Katya):        Yeah. Yeah, Bartel. All right. All right, my cubs.
Austin:        Do badgers have cubs?
Keith (as Bartel):        I'm rubbing my little paws together.
Austin:        Yeah. Katya pulls like a cloak a little closer, this old, ratty, brown cloak.
Austin (as Katya):        I will trudge through the snow. You follow close behind. Will be path for you, and will not fill in with snow too quickly, ya. Okay.
Austin:        And I just start marching up the, the like, snowy cliff, uh, like mountains. Like really slowly. Because it's like, heavy, deep snow. And I'm just kind of trying to make a pathway for you to walk behind me. And, doing my best. Hoping that we can like, climb up to the top of this first like, section, so we can get a lay of land, and maybe figure out where the fuck the cave of bees is. Uh, uh, it's very cold. But that's, it's, it's happening. Do we get up there okay?
Art:        Yeah.
Keith:        Yeah, I think this just sucks.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin:        Okay, it just sucks. Yeah, okay. Uh... so then we get up there. We get up to like this, this kind of vista of, of the mountains, and begin too look around for where this is. Uh, and I think I'm going to spend my second set, I'm going to do another one of these things. Uh, another hope. Leaving me with only 4 rascality. I have 4. Bartel has 7. Stoffle has 5. Uh, I forget how, how do you get that back, besides...
Keith (as Bartel):        I have a move that does it.
Austin:        Oh, right. That is your gift, right? You get it back from that. Yeah.
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah.
Austin:        Okay. Uh, and then I think everybody else just gets it from like downtime stuff. Uh... uh... and I think we just see, what do we see? What's the, what is the thing that gives away where the bees are? And this will be, the hope that I'm choosing here is, a threat or obstacle reveals a weakness to you. Or I guess it's actually, you find out some important information about your goal, is actually what it is. Uh, can it just be that we see a little bee in a scarf? [chuckles]
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin:        And like a hat. Like [bee buzzing noises]
Keith (as Bartel):        Hey!
Austin (as Vesper):        [buzzing] Hey!
Austin:        That's too loud.
Keith (as Bartel):        Are you, are you a little bee wearing a scarf?
Austin (as Vesper):        I wouldn't say little.
Keith (as Bartel):        Mmm... you're little compared to me.
Art (as Stoffle):        I can say that that is about an average-sized bee.
Austin (as Vesper):        I'm about an average-sized bee.
Keith (as Bartel):        All right. Are you a bee, are you an average-sized bee wearing a scarf?
1:08:41.6        
Austin (as Vesper):        That is correct.
Keith (as Bartel):        Are you... living in the cave of bees?
Austin (as Vesper):        Well, I've... never heard of such a thing.
Keith (as Bartel):        You're lying.
Austin (as Vesper):        I... would never lie.
Keith (as Bartel):        You're lying again!
Austin (as Vesper):        I've never lied in my life.
Keith (as Bartel):        This is three lies.
Art (as Stoffle):        What are you doing up here?
Keith (as Bartel):        And that means you've got to tell me where the cave of bees is.
Austin (as Vesper):        It does not work that way. I am on a, a, a... what do — hm...
Austin (as Katya):        See, he's lying. He's definitely lying, you are right.
Art (as Stoffle):        You're definitely lying.
Keith (as Bartel):        Three lies in a row means you've got to tell me the truth!
Austin (as Vesper):        I am on a constitutional.
Austin:        I think that's a, I think that that's an attempt here, Bartel. I want to say that's like a riddling or something, right?
Keith:        Yeah.
Austin:        I feel like, that's like, you've [chuckling] invented a law, as if it's real.
Keith:        [laughing]
Art:        If it doesn't work, of course, if I ask someone a question, they can't lie to me.
Keith and Austin:        [outburst of laughter]
Art:        I want to see this out... but when it's over, I have a plan B. [they're both still laughing] So, so this, this is, I don't think this is dangerous, and it's not even uncertain, because if, if it doesn't work, then Stoffle —
Austin:        It's, yeah, it's not, it's not. So, yeah, he's just going to lie to you again. Uh... I've got to find a name for this motherfucker.
Keith:        Oh, we're not going to, we're not going to see if my riddle works?
1:10:05.3        
Austin:        Oh, go ahead and roll it, go ahead and roll it. Okay.
Keith:        What is it, 2D6?
Austin:        No, your riddling is 1, so 1D6. [roll20 boop]
Keith:        2.
Austin:        2, so it does not work, in fact. And not only does it not work, that is a, uh, that is a... you describe how the situation goes completely wrong and you're put in perilous danger, but a friend gets to say what sliver of hope remains for you. Uh... I think the bee just starts is to run away from us, or fly away from us at this point, saying, like — uh, what's the word? Oh, I think that, I think that this bee just says —
Austin (as Vesper):         This is why the bees left! [buzzing noise]
Austin:        And begins to fly away. But there is a sliver of hope, which is — you find a reserve of inner strength you didn't know you had, and you get to restore your rascality. So you get back your 3 missing rascality.
Keith:        Okay. Can you put those back for?
Austin:        Boop, boop, boop. Done. [chuckles] So this bee is now fleeing us.
Austin (as Katya):        Come back. We are not done with you, bee.
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah, bee.
Art (as Stoffle):        Come on, bee.
Austin (as Vesper):        Bye!
Keith (as Bartel):        Hey, bee.
Austin (as Vesper):        That is not my name.
Keith (as Bartel):        What's your name?
Austin:        I'm not as good at bee names here as, as Art is. Art had it down I've been looking... I don't have a good one. Art, do you have a good bee name?
Art:        Uh...
Austin (as Vesper):        Vesper!
Austin:        Because it's like a wasp, wasp is, that's where wasp comes from, it's fine.
Art:        Oh, great.
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Keith:        Just obviously had a smarter beekeeper.
Art:        A less on-the-nose beekeeper is a... great thing to have.
Austin:        Mm-hm. Uh... and Vesper is flying away. Also, I'm going to say, Vesper it actually she/her.
Keith:        Or that's just the first one. That's the first name, and then you just get lazy with it.
1:12:14.0        
Austin:        Yeah. [chuckles] uh-huh.
Keith:        Like, what can I fit bee into it?
Austin:        Uh... so yeah.
Keith:        A-pollen-bee. It's like apology. Sorry.
Austin:        Good. Boo. Boo.
Keith:        Sorry, bee. That's what your name is, now.
Austin (as Vesper):        No! My name is Vesper. Uh, and I'm leaving! Bye.
Art:        Vesper Waspington.
Austin (as Vesper):        Just Vesper. Single — single names.
Art:        I think you should consider — I mean, isn't it confusing in there, with the other bees named Vesper?
Austin (as Vesper):        No. Bye! I'm leaving.
Austin:        And does begin [chuckles] to like fly up the mountain, away from us.
Austin (as Vesper):        And also there is no in there! There is no one in there, at all! No such thing. It's just me, on a walk.
Keith:        Who can say where the bee goes?
Austin (as Vesper):        [singsong] Who, can, say, where the bee goes?
Austin:        And she, she flies up this mountain.
Art:        Ugh, Annie is going to copyright strike our...
Austin:        Yeah, well... it was about time, honestly.
Art:        Yeah.
Austin (as Katya):        Well, we know there are bees near here.
Art (as Stoffle):        And they're in the mountain! We've just got to get in...
Art:        Maybe there's like, a, I was going to say... but a bee wouldn't need a door that a badger could fit in. That's a, that's an old saying.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes. A bee does not —
Art (as Stoffle):        An old beekeeping saying.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes, of course, yes. [chuckles] Also an old badger saying. How... how can we find —
Austin:        I think we're at either Bartel or Stoffle, here, walked us up this mountain.
Keith:        Did we ever bring up how Art specifically didn't want to be a honey badger, but then became a regular —
Austin:        Uh-huh.
Keith:        Badger, that was a beekeeper?
Austin:        I know. It's fucking unbelievable.
Art:        That did come up, yes, thank you.
Austin:        It's so funny. Uh, I think Stoffle or Bartel, it is probably your turn here, in terms of, how do we find this place?
Art:        Oh, I think this is probably Bartel.
Austin:        Yeah.
Keith:        Mmm.
Art:        Unless he's going to get there by smelling it.
Austin:        Well...
Keith:        You could smell the honey, but although, you know, your nose probably doesn't work as well in cold.
Art:        Yeah, but in the mountain. That doesn't get us in mountain.
Austin:        But maybe there's like a waft...
Keith:        I think, I think this is sneaking.
Austin:        Oh, okay. You think this is like, we gotta, we gotta trail Vesper [laughing] as she flies back —
Keith:        You know, you know what, you know what we should have done? Me saying, you've got to tell me the truth because you said three lies, we should have rolled that as befriending.
Austin:        Mmm, I don't know that that's befriending. I think any time someone says, “you have to tell me the truth,” I don't want to be friends with them.
1:14:56.1        
Keith:        Well, but it was obviously... this was not a typical way of, you've got to tell me the truth.
Austin:        Yeah, I... I think I would have pushed back on that, anyway. Also you rolled one die for that, it didn't work. Even if we had said it was befriending, it still would have been a two.
Keith:        Let's see. I think, uh...
Austin:        Again, we don't have to look at —
Keith:        I think it's sneaky. Maybe we just follow this bee.
Austin:        Yeah.
Keith:        Like, covertly follow the bee.
Art:        Like Mission Impossi...
Austin:        Uh-uh.
Art:        Bee...
Keith:        Possible...
Austin:        It doesn't work. That doesn't work. Also, TAZ just did a Mission Imp-Hospital joke. We can't do this. We can't just bite their Mission Impossible pun. We have to make our own puns. These are the rules.
Art:        Fine. It's Top Gun 3 —
Austin:        Thank you.
Art:        But the pilots are bees.
Austin:         What's the name of the —
Art:        Bee Movie 2: Top Gun 3.
Austin:        [laughing] There we go.
Keith:         Top Gun B.
Austin:        There we go. Now I'm talking about it. This is it. This is what the people want. Top Gun B. Uh...
Art:        Jerry Seinfeld and Tom Cruise...
Austin:        Playing volleyball, shirts off.
Keith:        Shirts off, playing volleyball, talking about cars —
Austin:        [laughing]
Art:        Complaining about —
Austin:        Come-bee-ans in cars getting coffee.
Art:        Come-bee-ans in cars getting coff-bee.
Austin:        [laughing] Coff-bee. Oh, a nightmare. A nightmare show we're running.
1:16:14.5        I don't think that this is, I don't think that this is dangerous or uncertain. I don't think the following is. So I don't know, I think that we like, yeah, we track this bee. It's maybe a little uncertain, but my gut says, Bartel, like, this is what you do. And, you, you notice —
Keith:        We can just go right in!
Austin:        Well, no, I think we make it to the entrance, but then the entrance is where things get sticky. Well, not sticky. We've already gone through stickiness.
Keith:        Well...
Austin:        I think it gets difficult when we get to the entrance, because it is a bee-sized holes. And it's one of many bee-sized holes. There's a bunch of holes into this cavern of bees, but they're all bee-sized, and they're smaller than us.
Keith:        I'm going to knock on the door.
1:16:54.9        
Austin:        There's no door. They're big holes.
Keith:        I'm going to knock on the... bee wall.
Austin:        Uh, what happens?
Keith:        I think a bee comes out. I think a representative —
Austin:        Representative. Rep-bee-sentative. What is the name of the rep-bee-sentative?
Keith:        Uh... Art? I don't know.
Art:        I used all of mine last time!
Austin:        Aw jeez, that was the first, that was the first problem. Uh... sunflower comes out, and says —
Austin (as Sunflower):        Hello, ferret.
Keith (as Bartel):        Hi!
Austin (as Sunflower):        [buzzing] How many cases do you want to buy?
Keith (as Bartel):        Oh, you've got a full shop in here, huh? Wow.
Austin (as Sunflower):        I'll mark down 3, if that's okay.
Keith (as Bartel):        No, please don't mark down 3.
Austin (as Sunflower):        3 cases of honey.
Keith (as Bartel):        No — well —
Austin (as Katya):        3 cases, we could do. Each carry a case —
Keith (as Bartel):        No. I have — I'm — I'm here looking for — I'm —
Art (as Stoffle):        Yeah, that's just good economy —
Austin:        That's just kind of, yeah.
Keith (as Bartel):        Excuse me?
Austin (as Katya):        Hello.
Keith (as Bartel):        I'm Bartel. What's your name?
Austin (as Katya):        I'm Katya.
Keith (as Bartel):        Hi.
Austin (as Katya):        Hi. Hello.
Keith (as Bartel):        No. No, no, no.
Austin (as Katya):        Hi, Bartel. How are you? Is good we found the bees.
Keith (as Bartel):        Sorry. I was talking to the bee.
Austin (as Katya):        Oh. Hello, bee.
Austin (as Sunflower):        Hello, Bartel and Katya
Keith (as Bartel):        What's your —
Austin (as Sunflower):        Hm... I don't suppose you are the Bartel and Katya who hang around the Hamlet restaurant in the United Hamlets, are you?
Keith (as Bartel):        That's absolutely true, yes.
Austin (as Sunflower):        I'm afraid I have to go.
Keith (as Bartel):        Wait, why?
Art (as Stoffle):        Wait!
Austin:        And — there was not a door before, but now there is like a [woosh] like a bank teller's [chuckling] slamming their thing shut, where it's like a wooden, a wooden slat door.
Austin (as Katya):         Stoffle, did you... upset your bees?
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah, did you do something to your, did you make fun of your bees, and then they ran away?
Austin (as Katya):        Why did you make fun of your bees?
Art (as Stoffle):        I would never!
Austin (as Katya):        Why do these bees not want, uh, to deal with us?
Art (as Stoffle):        I don't know, but I also would never name a bee sunflower! That's a bad name!
Austin (as Katya):        Hey, well, don't look at me. Blame... god.
Art (as Stoffle):        I don't think it was... [wheezes laughing] god. I think someone —
Austin (as Katya):        Every name, every name is gift of god.
Art (as Stoffle):        Someone names everyone —
Keith (as Bartel):        God, god names every bee.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes. Yes. Give every bee a name.
Art (as Stoffle):        God names every bee?
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes. Maybe this is why — did you name your bees? Did you discard —
Art (as Stoffle):        Yeah!
Austin (as Katya):        Their names from god?
Art (as Stoffle):        Well, I mean, god doesn't name —
Keith (as Bartel):        You make me sick.
Art (as Stoffle):        Everything else!
Austin (as Katya):        Bees — you... mmm. My foolish, foolish nephew! You said bees are special. And now you say, no, bees are not special. Why should bee be special?
Keith (as Bartel):        BB.
Austin (as Katya):        BB. Good name for a bee — [laughing] I would, I would say.
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin (as Katya):        We should knock on door, try again.
Art (as Stoffle):        It's, it's very hard to knock on the little doors.
Austin (as Katya):        We just do a little knock.
Keith (as Bartel):        Okay.
Keith:        I do another little knock. [knock knock knock]
Austin (as Sunflower):        [mumbling] Go away.
Art (as Stoffle):        Did you say Joe away?
Austin (as Sunflower):        Joe away.
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah, are you saying Joe away? Why are you saying Joe away? That's weird?
Austin (as Sunflower):        Because I gave a friend — I'm sending coffee out for a delivery, and when I do, I say, “Joe away!”
Keith (as Bartel):        Are you doing, are you doing mammal puns like we do bee puns?
Austin (as Sunflower):        Yes. Wait, what is, what is the mammal in question here?
Keith (as Bartel):        I don't know, just a mammal name —
Art (as Stoffle):        A baby kangaroo is a joey.
Austin (as Sunflower):        Oh, is a joey, yes. I thought maybe you meant like a human name, like Joe. Human name puns are very funny to me.
Keith:        We don't have — what? We don't have humans in this game.
Austin (as Sunflower):        Yes, because [laughing] we killed them all.
Keith:        The bees specifically?
Art:        Serves them to have dumb names!
Keith:        Or the animal kingdom?
Austin (as Sunflower):        This is too much lore, in my opinion. What is it you want? I will not be opening up my door again.
Keith (as Bartel):        Uh, I think that, I think maybe we should hear from Stoffle. I think that maybe Stoffle has something to say.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes, foolish nephew. What would you say to the beekeeper, or the bee — whatever he is?
Austin (as Sunflower):        Resident representative of the bees.
Art (as Stoffle):        Look. Hi, Mister bee representative.
Austin (as Sunflower):        My name is sunflower.
Art (as Stoffle):        I thought I was being more formal by using the title.
Austin (as Sunflower):        No!
Art (as Stoffle):        If I upset any bees by discarding the names you already had, from apparently, given to you —
Austin (as Sunflower):        From? From who?
Keith (as Bartel):        From who?
Art (as Stoffle):        From god.
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin:        We get a close-up of the bee kind of squinting through a slat of already tiny door, opens a tinier [laughing] slat, like viewport, to try to like scrutinize you to see if you're laughing at all when you say the word — the names given to you by god.
Austin (as Sunflower):        Mmm...
Keith:        Is that dangerous?
Austin:        Not yet.
Keith:        Okay.
Art (as Stoffle):        I didn't... know... that you had those. I thought like —
Austin (as Sunflower):        Did you ask?
Art (as Stoffle):        No. The same way that I've never asked a baby if they had a name —
Austin (as Katya):        Oh, Stoffle, Stoffle, no. No, no, no, no. Stoffle meant —
Keith (as Bartel):        You have got egg cream all over your face.
Austin:        [laughing]
Austin (as Katya):         Stoffle, you just stepped in a big, big spicy chicken cream pie.
Art (as Stoffle):        What?
Austin (as Katya):        You called them babies! They are —
Keith (as Bartel):        You called them babies.
Austin (as Katya):        They're no babies.
Keith (as Bartel):        [unintelligible] just like babies.
Austin (as Katya):        They are mad.
Keith (as Bartel):        Just like babies.
Austin (as Katya):        You said just like babies! Is big insult!
Art (as Stoffle):        I didn't say just like babies.
Keith (as Bartel):        You, you did, you said just like babies.
Austin (as Sunflower):        You said we were babies.
Art (as Stoffle):        I, I didn't I said as —
Austin (as Sunflower):        You said we were babies and you want our honey? You put babies to work?
Keith:        [laughing]
Art (as Stoffle):        I was just drawing a comparison in the naming practices...
Keith (as Bartel):        I'm starting to feel bad that I, that I led you here.
Austin (as Katya):        I'm sorry, Bartel, I didn't know the depths of my foolish nephew's —
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin (as Katya):        Terrible cruelty to these beings — to these bee-ings. These — is bad, I will teach, I will teach him later [chuckling] about respecting other species — I've done, this is, this is a terrible, terrible shame on our family.
Art (as Stoffle):        Everyone else knows that bees are given names by god?!
Austin (as Katya):        Yes.
Art (as Stoffle):        You knew that?
Austin (as Katya):        Of course!
Art (as Stoffle):        You knew that?
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah. Yeah. In school. We learned it, in school.
Austin (as Sunflower):        Everyone learns that lesson. Unless...
Keith (as Bartel):        Bees are given names by god, and then bees give us honey.
Austin (as Sunflower):        That is the, that is the exchange.
1:24:26.4        
Art (as Stoffle):        What's the exchange?
Austin (as Sunflower):        We get named by god, singling us out as special.
Keith (as Bartel):        Because they can make honey.
Austin (as Katya):        You know, the god of animals gives us all gifts. The, the badgers like us, we got determination — rrr — and singing, also. [laughing] we got two gifts. But don't tell —
Art (as Stoffle):        We are the best singers.
Austin (as Katya):        [laughing] We are... the best singers in all the kingdoms of all the animals.
Art (as Stoffle):        I mean, who can forget the song about that? [singsong] Who can say who the best singers are —
Austin:        [tries to start singing along but just breaks into laughter]
Art (as Stoffle):        It's the badgers. Everyone can [unintelligible]
Austin:        End of song. [laughing]
Austin (as Sunflower):        You should apologize, badger.
Art (as Stoffle):        I am so sorry. I didn't mean to undermine your relationship with god. Or to treat you like baby — bees.
Austin (as Sunflower):        Bay-bees. You can say, you can say it. Bay-bees.
Art (as Stoffle):        Bay... bees... what do you call a bee that comes from like, an area where the ocean is surrounded by land?
Austin (as Sunflower):         Sea-bees.
Art (as Stoffle):        But that's — but they're from the bay.
Austin (as Sunflower):        Hm... hm... beach-bees.
Art (as Stoffle):        Okay, I mean, I'm not here to...
Austin (as Sunflower):        Shore bees. That one sounds good.
Keith (as Bartel):        I had a shore bee as a kid, it was a pretty bee.
Austin (as Sunflower):        Hm. [sighs] You can come in. Go around back.
Art (as Stoffle):        There's a back?
Austin (as Sunflower):        Back, what is — go around back of the mountain.
Austin (as Katya):        Around back of the mountain? [sighs] Stoffle. All this for your bees.
Keith (as Bartel):        Well, why don't you just buy some of the honey while we're here?
Austin (as Katya):        And then we go. And we —
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah, because really what you're asking is, why don't you come back to my house and make honey for free?
Austin (as Katya):        Do you have, uh, the, head, head count for more employees? Is, is — budget ceiling high enough?
Art (as Stoffle):        I thought I was already, I thought we already had an arrangement like that. I was providing them —
Austin (as Katya):        What did they get?
Art (as Stoffle):        With pollen, and a place to live...
Austin (as Katya):        We cannot go down this road. This road... [chuckles] is too dark, conversation. You should have paid them more. Is simple.
Art (as Stoffle):        How do you even give them money? They're so small!
Austin (as Katya):        Lines of credit... perhaps.
Art (as Stoffle):        I'm supposed to start a bank? For the bees?
Austin (as Katya):        I —
Keith (as Bartel):        You should ask the bees how they'd like to get paid.
Austin (as Katya):        How — yes.
Keith (as Bartel):        It's like, ah, I guess that these employees are impossible to pay —
Austin (as Katya):        Employee-bees.
Keith (as Bartel):         I think, so I guess I just won't bring it up.
Art (as Stoffle):        Employ-bees.Yeah; I did know that —
Austin (as Katya):        Employ-bees.
Art (as Stoffle):        Yeah.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes.
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah. They hate to be renamed, but they do love bee puns.
Austin (as Katya):        They love the bee puns. Expect for in their names, which, not, not good. This is your decision, Stoffle. It you want, we can go around back and... put the pressure on them. Sing a song. Bee-friend them. Maybe do some stabbing. And come home with your missing 6 or 7 or however many bees. Or... you could do a trade for their honey here.
Keith (as Bartel):        It's like hundreds of bees, right? It's not 6 or 7?
Austin (as Katya):        Yeah, but Stoffle only had 6 or 7. There's probably thousands. Look, mountain... big.
Keith (as Bartel):        Oh, I thought... wait, I thought we were looking for, like, 200 bees.
Art (as Stoffle):        No, we were looking for 8 bees.
Keith (as Bartel):        We were looking for 8 bees?
Austin (as Katya):        Yes, we — [chuckles] Bartel, we dragged you across the world —
Art and Keith:        [laughing]
Austin (as Katya):        Because my foolish, foolish nephew lost 8 bees. And by lost, I mean, they went home. Which we are only just now learning.
Austin:        [laughing]
Keith (as Bartel):        8 bees can't even make hundred.
Art (as Stoffle):        They made honey.
Austin (as Katya):        Perhaps they were buying... bringing honey from here —
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin (as Katya):        And trading it to you.
Art (as Stoffle):        Well, then I think it's especially weird that they never brought up the money thing!
Keith (as Bartel):        Bees... they're allowed — it's not their fault that they're timid.
Austin (as Katya):        They're timid, and needed a place to stay, and you said, “yes, you can, you can —“ this is my impression of you, Stoffle, “yes, you can —“
Art (as Stoffle):        I appreciate this.
Austin (as Katya):         “ Yes, yes... it's me, Stoffle. It's me, Stoffle. I run a restaurant. I make waffles, and gooey egg and creams. And you can stay in the back room!” This is how you sound to me, all the time. All the time.
1:26:00.9        
Art (as Stoffle):        Okay, but you're forgetting the signature dish of the restaurant.
Keith (as Bartel):        “Ham, I also make hamlets.”
Austin (as Katya):        “I love to make a hamlet. It is, the town is called the Hamlets, and I make a hamlet in the restaurant, also.” This is how you sound to me. All the time.
Art (as Stoffle):        Do you not like the hamlets?
Austin (as Katya):        No, is good. Is good sandwich.
Keith (as Bartel):        I like the hamlets, I'm got going to —
Austin (as Katya):        The hamlet, on record, good. I like the hamlets. We should get our honey, and go home.
Art (as Stoffle):        Okay.
Keith (as Bartel):        How long will 3 cases of honey last you?
Art (as Stoffle):        Uh... it depends if it's a hamlet case or a bee case.
Austin (as Katya):        Hm, yes. We should get hamlet cases.
Art (as Stoffle):        Yeah, a hamlet case would probably last me the better part of a month.
Austin (as Katya):        [sighs] All right. Did you bring your wallet?
Art (as Stoffle):        Of course not.
Austin (as Katya):        Uh-oh.
Art (as Stoffle):        [chuckling] Well, maybe they'll take a line of credit.
Keith and Austin:        [cracking up]
Keith (as Bartel):        Sure.
Austin (as Sunflower):        We will need...
Keith (as Bartel):        Knock on the door.
Austin:        Yeah. Opens the, opens the door this time.
Art (as Stoffle):        Okay.
Austin (as Sunflower):        We will need... collateral.
Keith (as Bartel):        Well, what do you got?
Austin (as Sunflower):        No... we need the collateral —
Keith (as Bartel):        No, I'm sorry, I was — I was saying that to Stoffle.
Art (as Stoffle):        Uh... I have a, I have a restaurant. We could do like, some sort of co-op situation.
Austin (as Katya):        Hm. Yes. Yes! This is good.
Keith (as Bartel):        I mean, the honey biscuits are the only thing people really like, anyway.
Art (as Stoffle):        No, the hamlet is very popular!
Keith (as Bartel):        I like it.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes, but the bit that is good is, is the honey biscuits you get on the side.
Art (as Stoffle):        What? No, people love a one-egg ham omelet.
Austin (as Katya):        Yes, very much so, yes.
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin (as Katya):        They love...
Keith (as Bartel):        Yeah. Yep.
Austin (as Katya):        Yeah.
Keith (as Bartel):        And it's not because it's one of two restaurants in town.
Austin (as Katya):        All right. Here is what it sounds like. It sounds like my nephew, my industrious nephew, would like to... create some sort of business arrangement, in which the bees who come work or deliver the honey are cut in on the profit of this [chuckling] struggling restaurant.
Keith (as Bartel):        Part-owner? You bring on part-owners?
Austin (as Katya):        Equity, at least. Yes, Stoffle?
Art (as Stoffle):        Yeah, it's a, it's a, yeah.
Keith (as a bee in a window):        How many shares?
1:32:37.2        
Art (as Stoffle):        I'd really need to talk to someone.
Keith:        This is a bee in a window.
Keith (as a bee in a window):        How many shares?
Austin:        Yeah, the other bees start opening up other windows.
Keith (as a bee in a window):        How many shares for the bees?
Art (as Stoffle):        I mean we don't have any shares, now. So... the number would be meaningless — the number of shares is meaningless.
Austin (as Sunflower):        What's the vesting period?
Art (as Stoffle):        There you go, that's a good... uh, you know, we probably don't want to get bogged down too, too long. 6 months.
Austin (as Sunflower):        6 months? 6 months. Hm...
Art (as Stoffle):        It's going to work, or it's not. You're going to know right away.
Austin (as Vesper):        I think he said it won't work.
Art (as Stoffle):        That's not what I said.
Keith (as a bee in a window):        It won't work.
Austin (as Vesper):        You said wouldn't work.
Keith (as a bee in a window):        He doesn't have faith in the deal.
Austin (as Vesper):        No faith.
Keith (as a bee in a window):        No faith!
Art (as Stoffle):        I'm showing more faith —
Austin (as Katya):         Stoffle, you must project confidence with your voice. Speak with your chest. Hurgh. Grr. Business chest.
Keith (as Bartel):        Business chest!
Austin (as Katya):        Biz. Ness. Chest. Business chest.
Keith (as Bartel):        Chest.
Austin (as Katya):        Business chest. Bees-ness chest! Bees!
Keith (as Bartel):        Bees! Let's get down to bees-ness!
Austin:        And we're singing.
Art (as Stoffle):        Wow.
Austin:        And now we're singing. And this is it. I think we've [chuckles] stumbled into some sort of strange chant in which we outline the deal [wheezes laughing] that we're offering.
Keith:        By trading choruses.
Austin:        By trading choruses, yes, back and forth. If we had, if we — if only there was some sort of composer who worked for Friends at the Table... [laughing] who could cook up a musical number about these badgers and ferrets — and, and ferret.
Keith:        But there's not, so we're just going to have to do it right now!
Austin:        Improv!
Art:        And a 1, 2, 3, 4!
Austin:        Well... APR is — okay, we're not going down this road. [laughing] Uh...
Art:        [unintelligible] cap at 10 percent, the bees should get 10 percent max!
Austin:        [laughing] I can picture you doing a little, a little, you know, soft-shoe with that. Soft-shoe? Soft-step? What's the, what's the word?
Art:        Soft-shoe is right.
Austin:        Okay. Uh...
1:35:01.3        I think this is, I think this is it. I think we're doing the singing roll. Do you want to take the lead, or do you want, do you want me to take the lead? So I think it has to be you, Stoffle. I'll help. I'm going to spend a thing to give you an extra die, for sure.
Art:        [chuckles] Oh, you mean rolling, you don't mean coming up with the song.
Austin:        [chuckles] Yes, I meant rolling.
Art:        [laughing]
Austin:        Oh, it'd be very funny, though. Uh, I'll spend a rascality to give you an extra die.
Art:        I mean, Jack's always saying, “I don't have enough to do on the show...”
Austin:        Yeah. Yeah.
Art:        “I feel like I'm wasting so much time —“
Austin:        Yeah, all the time.
Art:        “Let's do a full orchestrated number for a live game...”
Austin:        [chuckles] Yeah. “Don't worry, just brainstorm something,” they say, they say, “don't worry about what else I got going on, even if I have to spend all weekend composing already. Come at the most complicated — if you it could give me a rhyme — a, a rhyme pattern and a time signature, I'll knock it out, don't worry about it.”
Art:        And it has to be full of bee puns.
Austin:        And it has to be full of bee puns. Uh, this is true — [Thomas Winney] in the chat says, “you've minmaxed this game by realizing you could just sing about anything you're doing.” Yes.
Art:        Yeah, mm-hm.
Austin:        All right, so you're at 2D6, Stoffle.
Art:        Don't I only have 1D6?
Austin:        I, I helped. I deleted a rascality.
Art:        Oh, you're helping in advance.
Austin:        Yeah, listen, I gotta be part of this one, from the top.
Art:        Oh, I... didn't [unintelligible] in the same time.
Austin:        Oh my god, yeah, uh-huh. That's a 1, the first die. Second die coming. Oh! What are we going to do?! [laughing]
Art:        [laughing] [unintelligible]
Keith:        Uh, I can help, I, I have a —
Austin:        Please, Bartel, help us. [chuckles] please. I'm begging you. How are you helping us?
Keith:        Okay.
Austin:        The singing isn't working.
Keith:        Uh, the singing's not working... [chuckling] because —
Austin:        You know, you could also push yourself, Stoffle.
Keith:        I think it's because, the bees are so much better at making up this song —
Austin:        Yeah.
Keith:        This is how they, they do... all of their bees-ness, is through improvised song.
Austin:        Right, and there's a chorus of them.
Art:        Well, [unintelligible] how bees communicate through dance? Isn't that like a thing about bees
Austin:        Oh yeah, I think, that sounds right.
Keith:        Yeah, but this is a podcast, so we had to switch it up.
Austin:        Oh...
Art:        I was justifying... the thing.
Keith:        Oh, okay. I thought you were saying, shouldn't they be dancing?
Austin:        They could also be dancing.
Art:        They are dancing.
Keith:        Maybe we should stop singing and start dancing.
Austin:        Okay, yeah. Give me a roll. Give me 1D6.
Art:        Who, me?
Austin:         Keith is already doing it, it's fine.
Art:        All right.
Austin:        This is the helping die.
Keith:        Oh, okay, oh, I thought this was, I thought I was adding a die.
Austin:        You are, you are.
Keith:        Okay, I understand, yeah, yeah, no. Art, you can do it.
Austin:        Go ahead, Art.
Keith:        [outburst of laughter]
Austin:        Uh...
Art:        [also laughing hard]
Austin:        Good game, everybody, that's a third one in a row.
Art:        All right, I'll push myself [chuckling], is that 2?
Austin:        2, yeah, 2 rascality to push yourself. Holy shit. Three 1s in a row is unbelievable!
Art:        That's unbelievable.
Austin:        They're just getting more and more of the business, is what's happening, in my opinion. [roll20 boop]
Keith:        Yeah, yeah, they're —
Austin:        Oh my god!
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin:        That was a 2. Uh... I think this is, I, we...
Keith:        Is there — I don't think there's anything else we can do.
Austin:        Uh, you could push yourself, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da... someone may — we both helped... oh, also you're wounded, which means you have to spend more rascality than that. For each thing that you, for each, because you're wounded, each time you spend rascality there, you have to get rid of an extra one, yeah, so there's a little more. Uh, you're down to your final two rascality. Uh... buddy... [chuckles] I think this line of, this line of inquiry is closed.
1:38:37.5        I don't think they're going to buy into it. Uh... I think, you get a hope, though.
Keith:        Or they bought too much into it.
Austin:        Yes, they, this is what I love about you, Keith. You've studied Friends at the Table, you understand that sometimes, the best failure is when the GM says, “yeah, yeah, yeah, you get what you want.” And they literally buy in too much.
Keith:        They give you a massive loan.
Austin:        Huge loan. In fact, they... you, you do still make hamlets at the Hamlet in the United Hamlets, a restaurant owned by the bee collective.
Keith:        Right. They own, probably, they own like 85 percent of the restaurant.
1:39:15.5        
Austin:        I think I know exactly what happens is, we think we got 'em. We say, we keep lowering the percentage, and they keep going like, “that sounds good.” We're like, “well, what about 1 percent?” And we realize, they meant 1 percent per bee. And so it ends up — or like 1 percent per person bought in. And so it ends be being, the three of us get 1 percent of this business, and so do 97 bees. [chuckles] You could... resist the consequence. Oh, wait, you can't, because [laughing] it costs 3 rascality.
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin:        Uh, but that's the, I think that the, uh, the, uh... where is it, the... important — no, a threader — no, I don't —I think this is a hard failure. But we think it's a success.
Keith:        [chuckling] Sorry, you lost your restaurant.
Art:        Oh my god.
Austin:        Honestly, could have — this is probably better. I think we, I think... here's my pitch. We just cut to us on the road, and Katya says —
Austin (as Katya):        My nephew, I am so proud of how you handled yourself in the negotiation. You found new verses, you had that whole, uh, solo about interest and credit. And now we have so many more partners. We diversified the portfolio of investors.
Art (as Stoffle):        Yeah.
Austin (as Katya):        You seem sad.
Art (as Stoffle):        No, it's, it's going to be, it's going to be fun, I think, working with all those bees.
Austin (as Katya):        What if we gave —
Keith (as Bartel):        Bees are your real passion anyway, right?
Austin (as Katya):        You love bees.
Art (as Stoffle):        I do love bees.
Austin (as Katya):        Which is weird now that we know they have names given to them by god, it's kind of creepy in some ways. I'm sorry.
Art (as Stoffle):        You've never loved something that was imbued with characteristics by god?
1:41:25.3        
Austin (as Katya):        It would be for me, is, if I, what if spears could talk and own businesses?
Keith:        [chuckling]
Austin (as Katya):        If I learned that that was the case, and all I did was stab people with them, I would feel bad.
Art (as Stoffle):        Well, that sounds like a hook for our next adventure!
Austin:        [laughing] Uh, what's, give me — uh, the trip back is easier than the trip here, I'm guessing?
Art:        Yeah. Mm-hm. We're going to have to make all our money off of the second location in the —
Austin:        In the bear — in the Pine Barony.
Art:         The Pine Barony.
Austin:        [chuckles] God. The, [sighs] do the bees fly us back?
Art:        That's the thing. We retain the franchising rights.
Austin:        Oh... we do retain the franchising rights! [laughing] And so if the bees do a good job running the Hamlet in, in the Entitled Ham — the untitled — mmm. The United, the Un-ited Hamlets [chuckles] then it makes the franchise opportunities even greater. So we actually still want them to succeed with the original location. You know?
1:42:25.6        
Art:        Right, we're now — we're now the franchise boys.
Austin:        That's what they call us, the franchise boys.
Keith:        If they, if they have given us a massive loan, though —
Austin:        Check out our mixtape. Yeah, that's the thing, is, we actually got a bunch of capital. That's exactly what happened. [chuckles]
Keith:        Right.
Austin:        They gave us a huge loan —
Keith:        Yeah.
Austin:        In exchange for a massive amount of equity in the original location. And now, with this investment, we can start franchising out, right?
Keith:        But, but are, I mean — is Stoffle going to be able to pay back t interest?
Austin:        We'll worry about that in the future.
Keith:        That's, that will be what the next one is about, is about [laughing] how to pay off your interest.
Art:        And then arc 3, bee-nkcruptcy court.
Keith:        [laughing]
Austin:        Tip your waitress!
Art:        Goodnight everybody!
Austin:        Oh my god. What a nightmare, what a beautiful — we get back, and, and yeah, I think that's where it goes. I think that's the, that's the, the future here. Are there any last shots? Bartel, did you get paid? What did we pay you in?
Keith:        You paid me in free food.
Austin:        Can we still —
Keith:        Which I guess now Stoffle has to clear with the bees.
Austin:        [laughing] I think we had a contract —
Art:        Oh, you have to honor existing agreements.
Austin:        Yes, you have to honor existing agreements.
1:43:32.7        [laughing] Like that the rent was also paid was Hamlets. Which, honestly, great deal.
Keith:        [laughing] Oh yeah, there's no rent.
Austin:        God.
Keith:        Well, there's cost of material.
Austin:        Right, of course. Uh, all right, I think that that, I think that that has to be the wrap here. Thank you for joining us, on this second Bell Songs adventure. This is game is really fun, I really, really enjoyed it. What a goofy fucking adventure this has been. As always, you can find us — friendsatthetable.cash is where you can support us, @friends_table on Twitter. You can find me on Twitter at @austin_walker. Where can people find you, Art?
Art:        Uh, they can find me on Twitter at @atebbel, and getting sued by Enya, I think, is...
Austin:        [laughing] [Thomas Whitney] in the chat says [singsong], “who can say what the contract says? What the restaurant pays? Only bees!” Only the bees can say. Keith, where can people find you?
Keith:        Uh, you can find me on Twitter at @keithjcarberry, and you can find the let'splays that I do at YouTube.com/RunButton. I would say, make sure to check out our new let'splay of Silent Hill: Homecoming. The second episode just dropped.
Austin:        It's been good, it's been good so far.
Kate:        It's been... surprisingly good so far.
Austin:        I know. Have you played more of that game than what's out right now?
Keith:        Uh, yeah, by another couple hours, I think.
Austin:        Okay, but like, you just — there's only been one recording session.
Keith:        Right, so far.
Austin:        Yeah, okay, okay. And you — okay, you know what? I won't spoil the —
Keith:        We did, we recorded at the cottage twice, I think.
Austin:        Okay.
Keith:        So actually there's been two recording sessions, but they were like back to back, they were like one day and then the next.
Austin:        I'm excited to see more of this game, which, which I thought people hated [chuckles]
Keith:        Yeah!
Austin:        So I'm a little confused right now.
Keith:        Right! Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm really concerned at how bad things will go, or maybe, I don't know, the really —
Austin:        Maybe Silent Hill fans have what they want, which is — right, right, right, yeah.
1:45:31.2        Uh... are y'all ready to do a clap?
Keith:        Yeah, let me open up time.is. Now I'm ready.
Austin:        That sounds good. Ah, you guys want to do 50 seconds?
Keith:        Yeah.
Austin:        Art?
Art:        Sure.
Austin:        Okay. [claps]
