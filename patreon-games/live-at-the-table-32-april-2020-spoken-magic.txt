AUSTIN: Welcome to Live at the Table, an actual play livestream focused on critical worldbuilding, smart characterization, and fun interaction between good friends. I am Austin Walker, joining me today, Art Martinez-Tebbel.


ART: Hey, you can find me on twitter at @atebbel. 


AUSTIN: And Jack de Quidt.


JACK: Hi, you can find me on twitter at @notquitereal, or buy any of the music featured on the show at notquitereal.bandcamp.com.


AUSTIN: Today, we are playing Spoken Magic, a game by Dylan Grinder, which was designed, written, and illustrated in under 24 hours for the March of the Wizards 2019 game jam on itch.io. You can find it on itch.io. You can also find it in this very smart-looking uh, digital version on roll20! Which has all the rules, it has all the cards all set up already, and it saved me a lot of work. I'll say, shoutouts real quick, Dylan actually added me to a version of the game when it was still in the roll20 beta version, the pre-release version of it, but I did end up going back and buying it, because I like to support independent games stuff, and so y'all should, if you enjoy this, go support the game and pick it up either form itch, or here on roll20! I don't know which is better for, for Dylan, but I know as a player, having all this stuff here like this will have saved me probably, three plus hours of, trying to move, make digital cards and put them into decks and all that stuff. 
So, I'm just gonna read from the pdf here. Spoken Magic. [clears throat] "This grimoire will explain to you how to cast magic with your fellow spellcasters, and how to use that magic to solve problems as you travel this mystical world. But first, you need your components, you need a name, and you need your words. For Spoken Magic, you will need the following things for yourself, and up to— up to three other players. An index card, a pen or pencil, a six sided die, and a four sided die. You will also need to print out or construct the five arcanum deck—" Sorry, "Construct the five card arcanum deck, the 24 card words deck, and the 30 card location and problems deck. Once you have gathered and arranged the materials, play begins with each player writing down a sorcerous name upon their index card, leaving room for more information as the game progresses. Each player then selects a card at random from the arcanum deck, which describes to them the nature of magic words." 
Do y'all wanna do that in… onscreen here, do you wanna do a google doc, how do you wanna do that? What do you think's easiest?


ART: Great question.


AUSTIN: 'Cause I could pull some index cards here, but I could also just start a google doc.


JACK: Let's just start a scratch doc and…


AUSTIN: Alright, sounds good. 


JACK: Work from there. 'Cause we're gonna have to come up with like, what words mean in a bit?


AUSTIN: Yes, we are. That's true! Alright, let me start a doc and share it with y'all. Um… Spoken Magic… scratch doc! And then, let me get that share link and put that in… our internal chat. Boom. Gonna pull that up here now. Alright, so! Gonna give us all sections…. There we go. Alright. We need to come up with sorcerous, a sorcerous name each, and then, well what do we need, we need a section for… I guess it specifically says, write down our sorcerous name first. This is a big, this is a big question.


JACK: Before we know anything about these characters!


AUSTIN: We don't know what their magical arcanum is, we don't know what the words are we're about to draw.


JACK: [cross] No. They've gotta be sorcerous names.


AUSTIN: They do gotta be sorcerous names.


ART: Which, I mean, is a lot to ask.


AUSTIN: It's true.


ART: Because there's so many like, philosophies— I'd just like to point out that Jack is anonymous dolphin, and I love it.


JACK: Wow!


AUSTIN: Is that their sorcerous name? What am I? Art, you're anonymous leopard.


[ART laughs]


JACK: You're Austin. And you're Austin.


ART: You're Austin Walker.


AUSTIN: I am Austin Walker.


JACK: I'm sorry.


AUSTIN: Ah, damn.


ART: I'm sorry, what was my animal?


AUSTIN: You are anonymous leopard. 


ART: Ooh.


AUSTIN: I like that. 


ART: It's, y'know, 'cause sorcerous name.


AUSTIN: Yeah. 


ART: There are like— there's two big things that jump out at me.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: One, the absolute, ludacrisness of every wizard in a Tolkein story.


JACK: Mhm.


AUSTIN: Tolkein wizards.


ART: Your Gandalf, your Radagast, your, uh…


JACK: Your Sauroman—


ART: [cross] Sauroman.


JACK: Who's very different from Sauron.


ART: Yeah, uh huh.


AUSTIN: Very different, or…? 


JACK: I just started watching that again today. It's, I'm an hour in and it's pretty good.


AUSTIN: It's pretty good!


JACK: Lord of the Rings? 


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: Turns out, it's quite fun to watch!


ART: Yeah, this feels like the environment where it would be fun to watch Lord of the Rings again.


AUSTIN: They're outside all the time, they're doing a journey?


JACK: [cross] They're outside all the time!


AUSTIN: I don't journey anywhere now!


JACK: At one point, the orcs destroy a, like a garden in like— the garden is like, several square miles, and they destroy it in about 40 seconds!


AUSTIN: Wow.


JACK: They're pulling trees down left and right, because Sauroman doesn't want a big garden anymore, he wants war.  It's a metaphor.


AUSTIN: Oh, I see! I see. [laughs] So that's—


JACK: Yeah, so— Yeah.


AUSTIN: [cross] Wait wait wait, so what's the other—  so that's one school of thought.


JACK: You've got your Radagasts.


ART: Uh huh.


AUSTIN: Right, your, your—


ART: And then I feel like you have your… what's the… oh this is, this is where the Kingdom Hearts people are gonna lap me here.


AUSTIN: Yen Sid! 


ART: What's the name of the— yeah!


AUSTIN: Uh huh.


ART: You're just like—


AUSTIN: [cross] That's what I thought was school one.


ART: [cross] This is just random names. These are just random letters you've thrown together.


AUSTIN: That's not what Yen Sid is, Art.


ART: What is it? 


AUSTIN: What?


JACK: Art.


AUSTIN: Art… 


ART: Oh! Wait, I got it! I got it! 


[AUSTIN and JACK laugh]


JACK: Welcome! 


AUSTIN: Uh huh!


ART: Yeah. Mhm. 


AUSTIN: Do you know that there's also a character in Kingdom Hearts named Eraqus? How do you think they spell Eraqus?


ART: Is it 'square' backwards?


AUSTIN: It's square backwards.


JACK: Oh, really? 


ART: They're cowards for not doing the whole Squaresoft. 


AUSTIN: That is true. That is a hundred percent true. 


ART: And making it Tofseraqus, or whatever. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, Tofs, hyphen—


JACK: Tofseraqus?


AUSTIN: Tofs hyphen Eraqus!


JACK: He's on Boris Johnson's cabinet. [AUSTIN laughs] Tofs Eraqus, Minister without portfolio. [AUSTIN sighs] Right, right, right! Alternatively, you've got the third category, which is the way mages in the Witcher's names work, which is just they're called like, so and so of somewhere or another.


AUSTIN: Is that a thing? What's that, give me an example. Witcher… wizards.


JACK: Like, Sheila de Tancerville?


AUSTIN: I see, yes, yes. 


JACK: Yennefer of Vengerberg.


AUSTIN: Of Vengerberg, yeah, of course, of course. Yeah. Lydia de Bredevoort or whatever, yeah. Uh huh! I'm getting the lists, I'm looking at 'em. There's also a Raford the White, which is just a off brand Radagast—


JACK: [cross] Gandalf.


AUSTIN: Slash Gandalf.


JACK: Or, yeah yeah yeah.


AUSTIN: It's a Gandalf, Radagast crossover. 


JACK: Yeah.


ART: Oh, and I guess that there's um, there's the Wizards of the Coast model, the, the Magic the Gathering…


AUSTIN: The Planeswalkers version.


ART: The Planeswalkers, who're like, first name, comma, some title, 'cause they all have to have like eight cards?


AUSTIN: Right. Right. Do you have an example of one of those? Like, Jace the Mindsculptor. 


ART: Yeah. I was gonna say mindbender, and knew it was wrong.


AUSTIN: Not mindbend— [laughs] It's pretty funny though, isn't it?


ART: Yeah!

JACK: Oh, that's kind of fun! 


AUSTIN: Nicol Bolas the Arisen! Yeah, these are good.


ART: Yeah. Or these are—


JACK: [cross] These just sound procedurally generated, and I'm kind of into it.


AUSTIN: Mhm. Mhm.


ART: I mean, 'cause they have, they do like, two or three per set, they do three or four sets a year?


AUSTIN: Uh huh.


ART: Like, they have to have a lot of these.


AUSTIN: True. I just wanna, real quick, shoutouts, because we did skip one type of wizard name. Which is like, stage magician name. Like, The Great Fantasmo!


ART: Ohhh.


JACK: [cross] The Great Fantasmo!


AUSTIN: Like the Great Fantasmo, or, the Illustrious Alazar! Or whatever, right?


ART: Chris Angel, Mindfreak. 


JACK: Who's that fuckin— 


AUSTIN: Chris Angel, Mindfreak. No, that's a Magic the Gathering—!


ART: [cross] I guess that's still a… That's a Planeswalker!


AUSTIN: [laughing] That's a Planeswalker! Chris Angel's a Planeswalker! 


JACK: Wow! Espanarde, the Great and Eclectic!


AUSTIN: Yes, Espanarde the Great and Eclectic, yes, yes, yes, of course!


JACK: Yeah. Hope he's doing okay.


AUSTIN: I, y'know? I have no idea anymore. 


JACK: No.


AUSTIN: It's so nice to have just opened a valve and emptied my brain. No, I don't even know anything about that person anymore, I don't know that man! I'm sorry to that man! [JACK laughs] I don't know him! 


JACK: Pointing at Espanarde. 


AUSTIN: Yeah! [laughs] Pointing at a character who at some point was probably some weird twist, I don't know! 


JACK: Yeah. I mean, so is the answer actually that we have a different— are we from three schools?


AUSTIN: [cross] We each get a different— yes, yes. 


JACK: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Clearly. 


JACK: Okay.


AUSTIN: Does anyone have a strong… direction here?


JACK: Not really.


AUSTIN: Oh there is a fourth school, there is a fourth school. Um, and it is, the like, I guess, y'know what, nevermind, this is just a sub, subcategory of, of Magic the Gathering ones, which is like, Fromsoft—


JACK: Oh, sure.


AUSTIN: Fromsoft wizards. Like, Micolash, Host of the Nightmare. Right? Like that is…


JACK: [cross] Yes, yeah.


AUSTIN: That's a comma splice one.


JACK: Blighted Demonask, Unforgiven someone or another.


AUSTIN: Right, exactly, yes. Yes, yes. Though actually, I'd say Dark Souls, actually now that I'm looking at it, kinda plays in all the— also plays in the Witcher space, plays in the space of, y'know, Quelana of Izileth, right? Like that style, the of—


JACK: Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah.


AUSTIN: But also has, Big Hat Logan. Incredible.


JACK: Uh huh. Okay.


AUSTIN: A lot of them, though, I guess maybe the distinctive thing here is, a lot of them are hey, that's like a name I already know but a little different. It's like one of those.


JACK: It's spooky. Yeah. Okay!


AUSTIN: So does anyone have a strong direction they wanna go in here?


JACK: I have a, I have a name, but it needs more bits, it's not wizardy enough yet, if you know what I mean.


AUSTIN: Mhm.


JACK: Like, I like the name Smokeacre as one word?


AUSTIN: Good name, yeah. 


ART: Yeah, great work.


JACK: But I think it needs to be Smokeacre of, or like, or like, noun Smokeacre, or like, y'know.


AUSTIN: Right, yeah.


ART: Could Smokeacre be your place? Blank of Smokeacre?


AUSTIN: Oh, see?


JACK: Ooh!


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: Yeah, right! That's a great point.


ART: The Smoking Acre? 


JACK: Yeah, it was— Ephrim came from there! Let me open up my names list and see if I have any more first names.


AUSTIN: Here's what— I have, I know my, I'm in the same place with you, which is, I have the end of my thing, but only part of it. I have: Name— the Wizard Adjective! And I don't know what the adjective is, but that's like, instead of like, the Grey Wizard, it's like, the Wizard Grey, but mine doesn't have to be a color.


JACK: Oh,  yeah.


AUSTIN: It could be the Wizard— y'know, whatever, I almost said turquoise, that's also a color. So that wouldn't have worked, unless it was like made of— the Wizard Cobalt, and then I'm like, made of cobalt. Y'know what I mean?


JACK: That's pretty good.


ART: Although like, once you have like, the Wizard Adjective, I don't know why my mind went here?


AUSTIN: Yeah, please.


ART: But I was like, the Wizard Resplendent.


AUSTIN: So yeah, that's, this is what I'm saying.


JACK: I was also thinking of something similar like that.


AUSTIN: See this is, this is what I'm talking about here. I like this! This is what I like. But then I just need a good— I'm gonna, I'll get there on the name, don't worry.


ART: I'm trying to find an off beat real— I'm trying to like, twist an actual name. 


AUSTIN: Do you know what the real name is that you're trying to get here?


ART: No, I'm trying to think because like, this is a thing, where I have to be— I have to get a common enough name that it's immediately recognizable, but like the, it can't be like, too common.


AUSTIN: Right. 


ART: I sorta wanna like, get one of those like, you know those new names? Them new names people are using?


AUSTIN: People have all sorts of new names, the names these days are really gettin' wild. What are you talking about, what're you talking about, you're talking about wizard names? 


ART: Uh, Daffy Dean, and his French cousin. Gouffe Dean. 


AUSTIN: Third base! 


ART: Well it's like, here's the fifty most popular names of the last decade, and you see names that you don't see… what the fuck, why would I click on an article saying the top fifty baby names of the last decade and then you don't even tell me? You don't even tell me?


AUSTIN: Fifty baby names last decade, what? What is this? Here we go, is it this one right here from MSN?


ART: Here are the fast— I'm on 24/7—


AUSTIN: [cross] I see that—


ART: Oh yeah, MSN, it doesn't give you the list, you have to like click out to 24/7 Wall Street dot com!


AUSTIN: Huh. No, I don't trust that one. So you're talking about new names, you're talking about— new eng— you're talking about new American names is what you're talking about? What're you talking about, 'cause there's lots of new names in the world.


ART: I'm talking about like, names that're popular now that weren't pop— so like, here's the top ten. Here's the top five.


AUSTIN: Ahem. Okay.


ART: Number one. 


AUSTIN: Mhm. Wa— no, no, no no, number five, please. 


ART: If I'm gonna count down, I'm gonna go back to ten.


AUSTIN: Okay, well go back to ten. 


ART: Greyson.


AUSTIN: Wait waiwaiwait. Stop, stop stop stop. One second. Uh. [typing] Alright. Gimme, just gimme, gimme one second here.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Alright. [clapping, a presenter saying "Ladies and gentlemen, here's— "] That's not gonna work, I need like, I need like, just the music. [Music from David Letterman's Top Ten List intro] Here we go! Aaand, here we go, go ahead, Art! Gimme your top ten newest names, or whatever the fuck this thing is you're doing.


ART: Did you have the— did you have the Letterman top ten list?


AUSTIN: Don't worry about it, you just go!


ART: Okay. Number ten: Greyson. 


AUSTIN: Grayson! G-R-A-Y-S-O-N, like Dick Grayson?


ART: G-R-E-Y-S-O-N. 


AUSTIN: Huh.


ART: So it's like an English Dick Grayson.


AUSTIN: Yeah, British Dick Grayson.


ART: Number nine.


AUSTIN: Oi, me parents. 


[JACK laughs]


ART: Axel. Axel's like too short to—


JACK: Died in the circus! 


[AUSTIN laughs]


ART: To twist. 


AUSTIN: Axel, like from Streets of Rage, yeah.


ART: Yeah, Axel like the—


AUSTIN: That's, that's why that name is popular now, is people love Streets of Rage, and like, Axel Stone beat the shit out of people, I'm gonna name my kid Axel!


ART: Number eight, Kai.


AUSTIN: Ooh, okay. Yeah. K-A-I. 


ART: Yeah. Also, too short to like, twist. There's only three letters.


AUSTIN: Three— yeah.


ART: Can't change one of them, that's… 


AUSTIN: Gai! Well, that's not very specific.


ART: Yeah. Number seven, Ezra.


AUSTIN: Ezra! Ezra Koenig, Ezra Kline. Koenig [kay-nig], not Koenig [koh-nig].


ART: I'll just say it, I think we could do better than Ezra.


AUSTIN: Hm. Gimme the next one. Gimme the next one. 


ART: I'm, I'm moving my tie right now! Jameison.


AUSTIN: Jameison?


JACK: Hmm.


ART: Yeah, this is the first one that's, that's legitimate.


AUSTIN: Hey, okay, wait a second! Other ones are legitimate. You mean— 


ART: Could be— could be twisted for our purposes.


AUSTIN: For your— yes! Thinking like a wizard already, this Art, let me tell ya! 


ART: Yeah. Number five. Everett. 


AUSTIN: I'm gonna say Jameison and Everett are both names that evoke the past, but wouldn't have been used as a first name in the past, right? These are last names.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Pretty— Right? That's the thing that's happening here.


ART: Number four: Ezekiel. 


AUSTIN: That's going to the older names, I would suggest.


ART: Yeah, that's an old name coming back.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Have we ever had an Ezekiel here?


JACK: I don't think we have, right?


AUSTIN: I guess not.


ART: It's a hard name to twist, also. 


AUSTIN: … Bezekiel.


ART: Yeah. Mezekiel. 


AUSTIN: Sezekiel. Dezekiel. Dezekiel! Also, you could twist it on pronunciation. Ezekiel, or—


JACK: Ezekiel? [eze-keel] 


AUSTIN: Ezekiel, yeah. 


ART: Ezekiel, alright, Ezekiel. Ezekiel? [eze-kee-el]


AUSTIN: Ezekiel, yeah, see?


ART: Ezekiel. Alright. This is, this is— number three: Luca!


JACK: Oh, Luca isn't bad.


AUSTIN: Luca's not bad. My brain is ruined because I can't hear Luca without thinking of Luca Blight, from Suikoden 2, who, who, if you take a look at the stream really quick, this is not gonna work, I have to copy and paste it, one second, uh, thankfully I did a search for Luca Blight, and it came up on this, villains.fandom.com thing, and above his name which just says "Evildoer", and then there is a jpeg of him that has been hastily turned, like turned transparent.


JACK: [cross] Turned transparent!


AUSTIN: Missing a number of little white dots! Luca's still good, Luca's not bad. Lux?


ART: My pull  for Luca is of course, Luca Brasi, who sleeps—


AUSTIN: Who sleeps with the fishes. Right, of course, of course. You don't wanna be either of those Luca's. 


ART: No. Number two, this is another old one coming back, is Theodore.


JACK: Hm, Teddy.


AUSTIN: Teddy. 


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: You could also do the name pronunciation thing there, instead of Theodore, it could be, Theodore. [thee-oh-dor-ay]


ART: [cross] The odor. 


AUSTIN: [laughs] The odor! Yeah, uh huh! 


ART: And number one, um. I— [desk drumroll] No amount of, nothing could give this proper, number one is Maverick. 


AUSTIN: Ah!


JACK: Hmm.


AUSTIN: Maverick the Wizard!


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Uh huh.


ART: That could be your adjective, so Wizard Maverick.


JACK: [cross] What about the Wizard Maverick? 


AUSTIN: The Wizard Mav— [laughs] What about the Maverick Resplendent! No?


JACK: Holy shit.


AUSTIN: The Maverick Resplendent? Mavericks are a type of wizard in this world. Done.


ART: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Stolen!


ART: Great.


JACK: Yeah, well that's kind of, that's interesting, because it's been formalized.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: Which isn't very maverick of them.


AUSTIN: Not very maverick. 


ART: Uh, cat— chat has… Magerick. 


AUSTIN: Magerick! That's very good, magerick has a good, there's good magic sounds in there, that D-G— y'know.


JACK: [cross] Alternatively—


ART: [cross] The I-C-K


JACK: Mage Rick.


ART: Oh, Mage Rick! 


AUSTIN: Magerick. 


JACK: I'm Rick! 


AUSTIN: Hey. How's everybody doing? It's me, Rick.


JACK: I'm Rick. Good to see you all here.


AUSTIN: I'm leaning way more— I was leaning way more Coach McGuirk than any sort of Rick from Rick and Morty, and I think that's my whole brand.


JACK: Oh, oh, yeah, yeah yeah. Wait, is Coach McGuirk's first name Rick?


AUSTIN: No. What is it?


JACK: What is Coach McGuirk's first name?


AUSTIN: Rick McGuirk is pretty good though. What is it? How can I not know this?


JACK: Does Coach McGuirk have a first name?


AUSTIN: Yeah. Of course. John. John! John.


JACK: John? 


AUSTIN: John McGuirk. Yeah. John McGuirk.


JACK: Everyone just calls me McGuirk, Brandon. I just.


AUSTIN: Right.


JACK: Given enough time.


ART: Have you noticed that like, Home Movies is like, having a—


AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah.


ART: A little bit of a snapback?


JACK: Is it really? That's great!


AUSTIN: Yeah. People are, people are, people recognize it, which is good. Alright! So what have we got here, Art? You are…


ART: Eze Ki'el. 


AUSTIN: Eze Ki'el, okay.


ART: Ki'el. [kee-el]


AUSTIN: Ki'el, or— okay. 


ART: Yeah, yeah, Ki'el is right, I'm gonna put a hyphen in there.


AUSTIN: Okay. Good. Hyphen, not a, not, okay, yeah! I like it, I like it. Jack?


JACK: I am Baron Domenico Smokeacre?


AUSTIN: Love it! Love it. And I am Estecar, the Maverick Resplendent.


JACK: Hell yeah!


ART: Wonderful.


AUSTIN: So. We all have our—


JACK: [cross] These are fuckin' wizard names we got here!


AUSTIN: [cross] We got some fuckin' wizards going on here! Are you an actual baron?


JACK: Hell yeah, absolutely!


AUSTIN: Can we get pronouns for these characters, also?


JACK: Mine is he/him.


AUSTIN: Mine is they/them. Art?


ART: Mine will also be he/him.


AUSTIN: Okay. Love these wizards, a lot. The… Once this has been done— oh wait, no, sorry, here we go. Now it's time to do some wizard shit. So. "Once you've gathered and arranged the materials, play begins with each player writing down a sorcerous name on their index card, leaving room for more information as the game progresses."


JACK: The past 45 minutes.


AUSTIN: Yep!


ART: [cross] Spend 45 minutes on names.


AUSTIN: Welcome to Friends at the Table. "Each player then selects a card at random from the arcanum deck." Or, the arcanum deck, "which describes the nature of their magic words." Are y'all ready to draw from this top deck, the arcanum deck?


JACK: So this is gonna tell us what kind of a wizard we are, right?


AUSTIN: [cross] I'm gonna shuffle it again, yeah. There's only five cards in here, so y'know, it's, only five schools of magic in this world.


ART: Alright.


AUSTIN: Who wants to draw first? That sounded like Art.


ART: Yeah, great, love it.


JACK: Art, tell us about what Eze Ki'el is doing. 


ART: Now, from the arcanum deck?


AUSTIN: Yes, the top deck.


ART: The blue one.


AUSTIN: Just pull it out, just from the top, click and draw it? Ooh.


JACK: Ooh!


AUSTIN: Your words are profane!


ART: Profane. 


AUSTIN: Profane. How do you—


JACK: Oh shit!


AUSTIN: I guess we'll see how you interpret that, right? I guess we'll see how it goes from here.


ART: Uh huh. I mean, I'm, yeah, mhm.


AUSTIN: We'll see, we'll see. Jack? Are you next, or should I go?


JACK: Uh, yeah, no, I'll go.


AUSTIN: Okay.


JACK: My words are…


AUSTIN: You've drawn it into your hand.


JACK: I couldn't draw it out!


AUSTIN: So.


JACK: Oh, I found it, I found it, I found it! Don't worry!


AUSTIN: You did. 


JACK: My words are restorative.


AUSTIN: Your words are restorative. Finally, my words are… stolen!


JACK: Hooo boy. 


AUSTIN: Phew! Love to have— so three wizards walk into a bar! 


[laughter]


JACK: Excellent! 


AUSTIN: Okay! Let's write these down here. My words are stolen, I've written down here on our scratch sheet.


JACK: My words…


AUSTIN: I'm also gonna open up a second version of the scratch sheet here just for me to see, so that I can keep it on my other screen and not have to switch between both sides every time I need to switch between both sides. Alright.


ART: What are the words we didn't get? 


AUSTIN: It's elemental, and then I forget what the other one is. Restorative, um…


ART: Are formed from nothingness.


AUSTIN: Formed from nothingness!


JACK: Ah.


ART: That's a good one. And—


AUSTIN: That's a good one.


JACK: That is a good one. 


AUSTIN: We didn't get that one.


ART: All of our words are better than elemental.


AUSTIN: Agreed.


JACK: Yeah. Oh yeah.


AUSTIN: Well, it's, y'know, sometimes you just want, oh yeah, I got elements. That's what I got.


ART: Uh huh.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Alright. I'm gonna go ahead and put my words are stolen in my discard. I'll put yours also in— oh wait, is that right? Yeah, that's right, that's right, okay.


ART: We haven't actually determined player order yet as per the rules, but…


AUSTIN: That's true, we have not, but here we are, I feel like we may have just done such. Alright. Uh… Getting my rules back— okay. So! "Once this has been done, share your names and decide who goes first by the most arcane means at your disposal." What is the most arcane way we could do this? Given the constraints of needing to do a livestream that completes today. 


JACK: [cross] Oh god. I… a candle?


AUSTIN: Because otherwise we would begin a ritual. Right, this is what I mean. I have one in my hand! Would you like me to—


JACK: Do you have a candle? Yeah! I also have a candle in my hand.


AUSTIN: [cross] It is sea salt… Art, do you?


ART: I don't I have a Jedi holocron.


AUSTIN: That means you go first. 


JACK: Yeah! Sorry.


AUSTIN: Sorry.


ART: Alright. 


AUSTIN: That means you go first, which worked out, actually, in our favor! [JACK laughs] I'm gonna light this candle. I think, Jack, that's part of it? We have to both— whoever lights the candle third has to go first, so Jack, can you do that?


JACK: Uh, yeah, my candle is already alight?


AUSTIN: Oh, I see!


JACK: But I could blow it out and light it again if you want.


AUSTIN: No, I think that that's fine.


JACK: Okay. That means I go second.


AUSTIN: That means you go— [laughs] That's right, that means you go second and I go third because I had to light it. Alright. "On your turn, ask each other player to tell you one thing about their character. You may tell them something of your choosing—" Oh, sorry, "You may let them tell you something of their choosing, or you may ask specific questions such as, 'Where did you learn your magic?'. Once your turn is complete, the next player does the same, until all players have taken a turn."


ART: Okay.


AUSTIN: "When you tell another player something about your character, you write that information down on your index card." So Art, you go ahead and either ask us, or tell us in order to tell you something about our magic.


ART: Um… Domenico.


JACK: Yes.


AUSTIN: Tell me about your appointment to a barony.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well, it was very simple. I killed the Baroness. 


ART: Oh, that is very simple, I thought there was gonna be a second sentence there!


AUSTIN: I saw that happen, I saw earlier there was a Baroness in your place, and then Domenico rose.


JACK: Yes, yeah, absolutely! And I imagine that a similar thing happened in the past, but I think that's all we know for now, I killed… previous Baroness of Smokeacre.


AUSTIN: Love it. 


ART: Great. Estecar.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes? 


ART: Is someone looking for you?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Of course, many people, my talents are… needed far and wide, but if you mean the law… well. I'm wanted in seventy states. Three empires. And…


JACK: [laughs] Seventy?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Seventy, yes.


ART: Seventy states, three empires?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Two townships. And, of course, by my parents, who miss me very much. But the world needs me, and so, it's the road. It's the road for me. 


ART: I wanna know about those townships so much, but I'm out of questions, so.


AUSTIN: Wanted! Across the world! For word theft.


JACK: Across the entire world!


AUSTIN: Mhm.


JACK: How do you pronounce your name, Art?


ART: Eze— kee-el. I think a hyphen, a apostrophe is more right than a…


AUSTIN: Okay, I didn't wanna push it. 


ART: Well, because as I said in this second, it sounds too Kryptonian!


AUSTIN: It does sound Kryptonian, you're exactly right.


JACK: Mhm. Eze Ki'el.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Yes. 


JACK: Tell me of your greatest mistake.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): … [sighs] I had… a disagreement with my teacher. And I left before my instruction was complete. 


JACK: Okay, yeah, feeling the call of the academy. 


ART: [whispers] Hey, how are we doing this, this little tabbed list thing.


AUSTIN: Yeah, you—


JACK: Oh, push a, push the minus button, then make a space.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: Oh! 


AUSTIN: Mhm. 


JACK: [sighs] Estecar. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes?


JACK: What is the longest you have stayed in one place? And where? 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well, I've been on this world for countless years. Is that what you mean? Or do you mean something more specific— a room? Or a chair? Or… something else. A pair of shoes? A ship. The plane we walk on. I travel daily, I never stay in the same town for more than 24 hours. 


JACK: Great! Okay! Asked and answered. 


AUSTIN: Eze—! Hm. Hmm! 


ART: Eze? [eza]


JACK: [cross] I think it's Eze?


AUSTIN: [cross] Eze? Eze! Eze. 


ART: [cross]  New word!


AUSTIN: Eze. Ki'el.


ART: Eze is a full name, a full first name.


AUSTIN: Eze is hard! Eze! 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Eze, my friend, my dear friend Eze! Ki'el. Sir Ki'el. Eze… Ki'el. What is… what is a word…


AUSTIN: See, we don't know how the word system works yet, but I'm gonna ask this anyway.


JACK: No… 


AUSTIN: What is the word— [breaking character] and you have no idea, I'm gonna say this for Jack at least, you've looked ahead Jack?


JACK: Just a little.


AUSTIN: Okay, well. 


JACK: Not enough to really prep.


AUSTIN: Don't worry, well okay, I'm gonna save this question for you instead, I'm gonna come back to you. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Who is it you profane?


ART: Well. I have a dictionary open with the definition of profane.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah, hm, yes, the dictionary is, is a harsh god!


ART: Um… I have to make a societal thing, right?


AUSTIN: Yes, yes. Or no. Play it by ear.


ART: Yeah.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): I profane the Church of Magic.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Hmm, yes! 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): And specifically, I uh… I am dramatically opposed to the current Mystical Pope.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Eugh. That guy. I'd like to steal a few words from him. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Tell me about it.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): My dearest friend… Domenico. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Yes.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): [shouting] Baron Smokeacre! I—


JACK (as DOMENICO): It is I.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I need to know. What is the word of magic, you can be abstract here, of course, language, is so hard to pin down. What is the word that you know you have lost, but believe I have stolen, because it makes it easier for you to live. Knowing it is still out there. When in fact it is gone, rightfully and truly! 


JACK (as DOMENICO): The great river of Smokeacre once flowed south to north, nourishing the daisy fields. Now it flows north or south, with the word relbor, I know that the river could by diverted, and I pray that it still exists, and I pray, Estecar, that you will have the good sense to use it.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Oh, I simply cannot use something I do not have, but I will be on the lookout for it, you know you can trust me for this, Domenico! 


ART: Oh my god, one of us has to draw that word now.


AUSTIN: I don't know, is that a real word from the deck, did you draw?


JACK: [cross] It was— it was a real word.


ART: [cross] Yeah, that was a real word from the deck.


AUSTIN: Oh, I love it! Great! I didn't even look! Write it down, yeah, uh huh! Okay. So. "You are all now powerful conduits of magic, but to give that energy shape—"


JACK: Hell yeah.


AUSTIN: [reading] "You will need words! Each player draws six words from the words deck, and decides based on their arcanum, and their deep mystical knowledge what each word means. Take what time you need, and no more. Your journey begins soon." So the words deck is the second deck here, which I can't ping, but it's the second one. I'm gonna shuffle it again. Then, I think we should— should we… open, should we each do them— okay, should we do this openly? Should we do this in turn order, what should we do here? 


ART: Oh, do you mean we should play face up?


AUSTIN: Should we play face up? Or…


JACK: I think—


AUSTIN: Or should we play it close to our chests? 


JACK: It is— it would be fun to know what kind of spells we can cast.


AUSTIN: Well, the words are just words, aren't they? Oh, I suppose you're right, right.


JACK: [cross] No, we find out what they mean, right?


AUSTIN: Yeah, we find out what they— well, we determine what they mean right now.


JACK: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Based on our arcanum and our deep magic knowledge.


JACK: Or do we develop a little secret… we do all— we do all seem like dickheads.


AUSTIN: We do— well, I think Eze Ki'el— Eze Ki'el seems fine!


JACK: Seems fine!


AUSTIN: Fuck the magic pope!


JACK: What we've got here is, we do really have a kind of What We Do In the Shadows of wizards team.


AUSTIN: [laughs] We truly do! Oh god, you're exactly right!


ART: Can we start the whole recording over and just do those accents?


[AUSTIN laughs]


JACK: I am from thirteenth century Ukraine! 


AUSTIN: Oh, that second season started, right? I need to, I need to fucking catch up.


JACK: Yeah, I need to watch it, it's not out in the U.K. yet, but it came to the BBC here, so I'm kind of waiting for it to just air properly, rather than…


AUSTIN: Yeah… god. 


JACK: Y'know. Looking on the internet.


AUSTIN: Yes. Okay. 


JACK: Let's do it secretly!


AUSTIN: Let's do it secretly. Alright, so then, let me see— 


JACK: [cross] I mean, actually, tell you what, Art? 


AUSTIN: Mhm?


JACK: You can tell us if you want. You can tell us what your words are.


AUSTIN: Ah, I see, yes! So see, I'm gonna just do it this way, I could just deal, what is it, five cards, six cards? 


JACK: Six, I think.


ART: Well, here's the thing—


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: We need to, we need to determine now what they mean. So like—


AUSTIN: Right, but we can do that privately—


ART: [cross] Do we wanna write it somewhere?


AUSTIN: I have have— I have, hm! Hm!


JACK: I have a secret, I have a, we all have like, smartphones, right?


AUSTIN: Yeah, we do have smartphones, I also have this…


ART: But where's the accountability? Where's the… We have to trust each other.


AUSTIN: [cross] We could— okay, we could—


JACK: We'll just trust each other!


AUSTIN: We should just trust each other. Who cares, we're wizards, I steal things. [laughing] But Black Dynamite! I steal words from the community! Uh, what is it, six each?


JACK: I think six, yeah. 


AUSTIN: Okay. There's six to Art. Though, chat is gonna see mine, so I don't even need to hide shit. Six to Jack—


JACK: Wait, that means we should close, we should close—


AUSTIN: What?


JACK: We shouldn't watch the video.


AUSTIN: Correct.


ART: Oh, I'm not watching the video.


JACK: We should— I have pulled the video.


AUSTIN: Yeah, okay. Six to Jack. Six to me. Six is right, right? I keep… okay. Okay. Ooh! 


JACK: Oooh! 


AUSTIN: I wanna— I wish I could zoom in on these here. I like that you're going ooh, and I'm like, how do I pronounce this? 


JACK: You got some spells here!


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh huh!


ART: I mean, here's the secret, Austin, it doesn't matter how you pronounce them.


AUSTIN: Isn't the thing that— Hm. Okay. Fair. Fair! Fair. You know what? Fair. Alright, so let's, let's get this over here. A fun thing is, I can barely make out— here we go, I'm gonna zoom in a bunch, yeah, there we go, that's what I'm talkin about— don't look at the stream! Don't.


JACK: So are we saying, we're literally just coming up with one word here, we're not describing what this spell does?


AUSTIN: Um, that's— okay, what it says is—


ART: It's not a spell, it's a word you're gonna add to a spell.


AUSTIN: Correct. Yes.


JACK: To a spell, right.


AUSTIN: Um… where… six cards, decides based on their Arcanum, and their deep magical knowledge what each word means, so yes. Yes. And it specifically says— "Take what time you need and no more. Your journey begins soon."


ART: Oh what the fuck, they still don't get any bigger. Oh wait—


AUSTIN: You could do like a zoom, you could do like a bad zoom in like I did?


ART: I'm just gonna find it in the pdf.


AUSTIN: Or, or find it in the pdf, yeah. 


ART: 'Cause it's sort of important what these letters are.


AUSTIN: Yes. 


ART: In another way, it's not important at all. … Oh, and no one in the chat say a word.


AUSTIN: Oh, yeah, of course, please. 


ART: And these can be anything, these can be proper nouns, these could be—


AUSTIN: [cross] These can be anything. These can be proper nouns, yeah, this is, this is, yeah. … Oop, wrong place, there we go, okay. I got my words. 


JACK: Okay, I've got my words.


ART: I'm not even close.


AUSTIN: Great.


JACK: That's okay! Yeah, turns out it was actually great to watch the beginning of Lord of the Rings today.


AUSTIN: Perfectly timed! 


ART: My problem is I— I was, the Hobbit movies came out when I was doing Box Office Democracy, so I had to see it every time it was number one?


AUSTIN: Oh no…


JACK: Oh no!


ART: So I saw each of the Hobbit movies multiple times—


JACK: [cross] Bad!


ART: And all of those movies are so bad, that I'm like, Peter Jackson sucks! And Peter Jackson doesn't.


AUSTIN: Mhm.


ART: But those were bad movies!


JACK: Not good movies. 


AUSTIN: Hm. I haven't seen 'em, but I believe you.


JACK: Don't. Really, don't. Very occasionally you see the, the little germ of when Guillermo del Toro was working on it in that movie, and you're like oh damn this rules! And then it—


AUSTIN: [cross] Oh, that sounds great, yeah yeah.


JACK: And then it goes away. It's not worth it. Those moments are not worth the rest of that movie. 


AUSTIN: Here's a question as you continue to think about words. Do we want to… think about playing the shorter version of the game? I guess I should raise— there is also a more triumphant version of the game, uh, which I had not even considered playing!


JACK: [laughing] No. 


AUSTIN: 'Cause—


JACK: Come on.


AUSTIN: [laughing] Because what we've gathered here today, is Jack, Art, and Austin! This is it! This is it, baby! If I don't make you cry today, I fucked up. [JACK laughs] I actually don't think this'll be that sad— oh, we'll see. I think we're gonna be— we might be bumbling.


JACK: What We Do In the Shadows gets sad sometimes!


AUSTIN: That's true! Exactly!


JACK: Gets a little melancholy.


AUSTIN: You've already talked about a river going the wrong way.


JACK: Yeah. Guillermo tries very hard.


AUSTIN: It's true… 


JACK: How did they, how did they reverse the river in Chicago? How did they do that?


AUSTIN: Well, the word's missing, so no one knows.


JACK: In Chicago, they lost the magic word?


AUSTIN: Yeah, that's why they can't put it back.


JACK: Oh, wow.


AUSTIN: Yeah. 


ART: Alright, I got, I got it, I'm done.


AUSTIN: Okay.


ART: I've really… We're gonna, you'll see.


AUSTIN: Okay. They've tried multiple times, Jack, is the answer.


JACK: What, they've succeeded, right?


AUSTIN: [cross] They started in 1850— In like, the 1840s, where they started trying to divert it elsewhere, and then in 1871, they lowered, they deepened the old canal in an attempt to reverse it, but it only lasted for a season—


JACK: Oh no!


AUSTIN: And then in 1900, they completely reversed it using a series of canal locks increasing the river's flow from lake michigan, and causing it to empty into the newly completed Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, yeah. It was named "A civil engineering monument of the millennium!" By the American Society of Civil Engineers.


JACK: Fuckin' humans.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: Just being like, the river is going to go the other way!


AUSTIN: Yeah, "before this time, Chicago river was known by many local residents as 'the stinking river', because of the massive amounts of sewage and pollution that poured into the river from Chicago's booming industrial economy." Great. Great. Alright! We're just like yeah, we did it, and now we're just done with it, it's just like that now. Too bad. Too bad, river!


JACK: Sorry, fish!


AUSTIN: Yeah, alright, so, really though, do we want— there are rules for a faster game, and I'll explain what those are maybe when we get to the first moment where they could impact the world, the game. Maybe that makes sense, then we'll talk about whether we want to include it or not.


ART: I will say, that in ninety minutes—


AUSTIN: Yes.


ART: A friend of mine is having like a Zoom birthday party?


AUSTIN: Sure.


ART: And I don't need to be there for the whole thing? If we're still going at six, I gotta…


AUSTIN: [cross] But you've gotta make an appearance. I would love— I would love to be able to get dinner at six your time. That would be fantastic.


JACK: So maybe, so maybe we do do the quick game.


AUSTIN: Or we just play long game and stop. Yeah, right.


ART: [cross] But we could also just stop, and yeah, and do it twice.  


JACK: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah, exactly. I would love to have a game lined up for May that we could knock out quick, because my May is gonna be a nightmare, so. 


JACK: Austin…


AUSTIN: It's fine. Alright!


ART: Is something replacing E3?


JACK: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Sort of.


JACK: Kind of.


AUSTIN: Yeah, we'll talk off mic. I mean it's not secret, uh—


JACK: No.


AUSTIN: I should check the…


ART: It's not secret, it's just it's just not important?


AUSTIN: No, listen, Geoff Keighley… is doing his best. 


JACK: He likes video games so much!

AUSTIN: He, he loves 'em. More than…


JACK: Loves them so much!


AUSTIN: I shouldn't say more than anything, I don't know what his life is like, maybe he loves other people too. 


JACK: But he does love video games.


AUSTIN: But what I do know is: Motherfucker loves video games. Alright. [reading] "The Beginning. Before the journey can begin, you need a place to journey from, your home. Draw the bottom card of the location deck." Fuck. Alright, well!


ART: Is this a thing we can do?


AUSTIN: Yes. No problem— location. Yes from a problem deck, no from the… I mean, yes, right?


ART: But it doesn't matter, right, any random card is the same as any random card.


AUSTIN: No, because it needs to be the bottom… how do we do it? Yeah, I guess it doesn't matter.


ART: Just put it aside, and we run out of cards that's the one. 


AUSTIN: Oh, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna check to see if it says anything different in the version of the rules that part of this version of the game, on roll20.


JACK: On roll20. 


ART: Oooh.


AUSTIN: "The Beginning! Draw a card front he Location deck, and take turns describing an aspect of this home, and why you are leaving. Once you all know your home, you must leave it. Your journey starts with the first turn. Alright, who would like to draw the location deck card? 


ART: I will! 


AUSTIN: Go for it.


ART: Sorry, my standing desk is going down. How do I… how do I un…


JACK: Oh no! Art is just crouching.


ART: Oh, I can't read that at all.


AUSTIN: I'll make it bigger. Ready? Pchoooow. Ahh! 


JACK: Oh my god! 


AUSTIN: Our home!


ART: Oh, wow!


AUSTIN: The Jungle of the Panther Queen!


JACK: Holy lord! I'm a Baron in Exile!


AUSTIN: Is that, is that why you are here? Is this where we've met? We've met at the—  Our paths have crossed here, and we've decided this is our home? And we're leaving it?


ART: Yeah, it's our home, so we've, we've been here. 


AUSTIN: But is it our home, or is it our—


JACK: [cross] Except Estecar, who never—


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): [cross] I never stay, anywhere!


JACK: I have no home!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Of course, I have to keep moving.


ART: The jungle's very big.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): The world is my home! The jungle is very big— yes, I will say one of the townships is in the jungle so I don't go towards the northeast of it, but other than that, I move freely among the Jungles of the Panther Queen. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): The Panther Queen and I have had our disagreements, and she has made it clear that I am no longer welcome here.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): A delegation to the Jungle of the Panther Queen, with the intent of bringing it into the Empire of Smokeacre, failed, my caravan was killed, and I remain here until it is time to leave.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): One day I believe we will return here, to the Jungle of the Panther Queen, our true home, a home for all of us, a home for all wizards, and also panthers, but until then, I think this is the moment that the three of us, the three amigos, should set out into the— is that taken? I'm hearing word that that is taken. [JACK laughs] I see. 


ART: We could, we could do that.


AUSTIN: [half in character] I suspect we cannot, I suspect the lore— Ellen has—


JACK: Legally!


AUSTIN: [laughs] Quite a few dollars! And—


ART: The Panther Queen Ellen.


AUSTIN: The Panther Queen— Ellen the Panther Queen! Yes. 


ART: Lady of all intellectual property. 


AUSTIN: Also jungle cats. A tribute. So I don't think we need to do anything with the prompt here, but yeah, so it sounds like it is our home in the sense that we all, arrived here at some point with, with some degree of optimism. I thought this would be my home. I thought maybe I could finally settle down, no, no I cannot. Alright. I think we know our home. Let's talk a little— Ellen the Panther Queen. El'len the Panther queen. Sort of like Ki'el, right? E-L— I'm gonna write this down. 


ART: [cross]  Yes. You can trace my lineage back to the, the—


AUSTIN: Oh!


ART: The Lords of the Leopards.


AUSTIN: Oh, right, I see.


JACK: Wow. 


ART: And so there is long term familiarity and animosity between our houses, and I thought that I could reignite our… our ancient kinship—


AUSTIN: [cross] I see.


ART: And alas, we disagree.


AUSTIN: We disagree. Is this intentional because you're the anonymous leopard currently, or is that just luck?


JACK: Oh! 


ART: I think I'm just primed.


AUSTIN: Yes.


ART: I think I was reaching for a cat and leopard was the last one I heard.


AUSTIN: I see. I love it. Alright.


JACK: Art, quick question.


ART: Yeah.


JACK: I feel like we should just, just ask this right off the top: Are you a leopard? We haven't really said whether or not—


AUSTIN: [cross] It's true, we have not.


JACK: Are you a kind of Red XIII situation, or… 


AUSTIN: Uh, yeah, uh huh!


JACK: Great!


AUSTIN: Okay, so you're like a, not like a leopard person. Not like, a humanoid leopard.


ART: Not a human leopard, like a big—


AUSTIN: Mrr.


ART: Like a dire leopard.


AUSTIN: Like a dire— so bigger than a normal leopard.


JACK: Oh, wow.


ART: Bigger than a normal— a, I'm as tall as a person, but I'm on—


AUSTIN: [cross] Ooh!


JACK: [cross] Holy shit! 


AUSTIN: Like a tall person?


ART: Like, our shoulders are even.


AUSTIN: Yikes!

JACK: A horse! A horse!


AUSTIN: Yeah— Art, you're thinking of a horse. 


ART: A horse leopard!


AUSTIN: A horse leopard! Yeah, love it! I have another thing to say here, and I will say it privately to my diary. Which none of you should see. [clears throat] And as I write, I say to myself—


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): This, of course, is my real home, where I was born and raised, and which I fled from, eager to see something that was not the voracious teeth of the panthers. Also, my parent situation, it was pretty bad. It was pretty bad, guys. Ahem, anyway, that was a private communique for myself in the future! I like to take little snapshots so that I can travel— It's a sort of word magic, I can travel back to visions of myself in other times! Anyway yes, this is, this is where I am from.


ART: I would like to just jump in here and make a clarifying point?


AUSTIN: Yes.


ART: Which is that Eze Ki'el wears clothes. 


AUSTIN: Hm.


JACK: If a leopard…


ART: Yeah.


JACK: Wore pants. 


AUSTIN: Ah.


ART: Uh huh. I'm ready for this.


JACK: Would it wear them like this? Or like this? 


ART: Um… the pants that Eze Ki'el wears… are around the waist, and cover the back legs.


JACK: Okay! I see. So were you to stand up, like a human, you would be wearing trousers like a human.


ART: And, and a, like a pirate-y shirt, y'know?


AUSTIN: Yes.


ART: Like a shirt a pirate wears.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Can I say, uh, Eze, your shirt game is on point. I would wear that shirt if it was only seven, eighteen sizes smaller, so it would fit me.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Hm, I can refer you to my tailor. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I would love that.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): He makes all of his clothing by claw.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Of course.


ART: Is that an Animal Crossing— did I just steal the Animal Crossing joke?


AUSTIN: Probably. We've all been inundated. [laughter] That mischievous Nook. Alright, so, things we know. Eze Ki'el, descended from the Lords of the Leopards. Is a leopard. Spelled leopard wrong. Still spelled leopard wrong, what am I— Oh, forgot the O.


ART: That's an O. Yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh huh. Leo, like lion, yeah.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Wears pants like… wait, like that? Or like this? 


ART: Like this, right? It's the first one.


AUSTIN: Like this, like this, yeah okay.


ART: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Alright. Each turn consists of three—


ART: Wait did we get Jack's— oh, yeah yeah.


AUSTIN: Yes. Attempted and failed to invade the jungle… does that mean you were here for years in like, a long terrible campaign?


JACK: No, no no, of course not.


AUSTIN: Okay.


JACK: It was something that my generals and I considered, and we decided to take the opportunity, boarded our caravan, traveled into the jungle of the Pirate [[they mean leopard]] Queen, they were all killed.


AUSTIN: Yeah, I have a question, why is the Barony not your home? Is this something we'll discover later?


JACK: No, well, of course, of course it is my home, I just feel like it's the role of any good Baron to constantly be thinking of expanding it.


AUSTIN: Okay. I see, got you. Alright, well. [reading] "Each turn consists of three components. Location, problem, and spellcasting. On your turn," and it is yours, Eze, "draw a location card, and describe a scene at the location you have journeyed to based on the prompt written on the card." Let's start by drawing this card and putting it in the location spot right here. Actually, I'm gonna make it big, so just draw it, and I'll make it big and we  can read it.


ART: Location cards are the least legible of all the cards.


AUSTIN: It's true. Ah! 


ART: Crystal Woods… pieces of the past.


AUSTIN: Mhm. The, so. "Describe a scene that takes place, describe a scene at the place you've journeyed to based on the prompt written on the card. This scene may involve the other characters, and you may invite their players to join you in describing or enacting this moment, but ultimately you decide what is and is not included in your scene. Take your time bringing wonder to the description, the lands you travel are quite literally only what you describe." 


ART: So a thing that a lot of people don't appreciate about the Crystal Woods before they've seen it in person—


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: Is that it's not just crystal trees and crystal leaves, it's crystal underbrush. It's crystal dirt. The whole place is just brilliant, blinding light all day long. At twilight, it's red, at night, it's, I mean it's a lot more like the regular woods at night. But— and the curse of the woods is that when you see a reflection, and all of the surfaces offer reflections from the right angle, you see a moment from your own past. 


AUSTIN: Am I there with you as we move through these woods? Are we all together on this one? 


ART: Yeah, I think so, yeah.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I would recommend we move quickly at night so that none of us have to confront any images that would misrepresent the past in any, in any way.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): It is so hot to sleep during the day. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): We simply need to not sleep! Ahem.


JACK (as DOMENICO): That's nonsense.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): What? What are we doing during the day? 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Closing our eyes, and feeling our way forward with our magic!


JACK (as DOMENICO): I can't do that. My magic doesn't work like that. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I see. A dilemma.


JACK (as DOMENICO): I'll be the first to admit it. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well… then… I suppose we'll have to be braver.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): And of course, we have to be cognizant of the… of the. You know, the crystal predators.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): The Crystallines!


JACK (as DOMENICO): Ah, the Crystallines.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): [cross] Ah, the Crystallines.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): [cross] The Crystallines. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Yes, with their teeth. And the, the blades above their heads.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Above their heads, above their heads, above their eyes, the brows, the brow blades.


JACK (as DOMENICO): The brow blades, they call them. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): That's what they call them.


JACK (as DOMENICO): I killed one, once. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Also, their fashion sense is… not as good as ours, is it?


JACK (as DOMENICO): No, of course not.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): No.


JACK (as DOMENICO): No.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Long trousers, too long for their legs. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Long sleeves, too long for the blades.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): It's very hard to fit properly when every reflection shows your past, though. You have to give them… some leeway here.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Yes, that is, yes, that's true I suppose, that in some level I do pity them.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): You would think that that would cause them to wear their pants… higher up, smaller, seeing themselves at a younger age, a mirror of a past self, a tiny baby self, you would think they would see that and go, I need smaller pants, but instead they get big ones.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): I believe that they look into their reflection and see their failures and become overwhelmed with despair, and cannot bear to hem their pants any longer.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I certainly have no idea what that would be like. Ahem. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Your pants look fantastic.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I, thank you, I have a tailor, I will— If you recommend me your shirt tailor, I will recommend you my my pants tailor, we'll have an entire outfit, a hybridization of high fashion.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): That would be wonderful, but wouldn't they both be in the home that we just left?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): One day we will return victorious! And see ourselves in new clothes. A symbol of our victory of this journey.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Hmm, victory clothes.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): The most important tradition of the Jungles of the Panther Queen.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes.


AUSTIN: I'm doing my best to like not look at any of this stuff, obviously.


ART: I think I am satisfied with our scene, so a problem occurs.


AUSTIN: Yes. 


ART: [reading] "Draw a problem card and describe the issue at hand based on the prompt written on the card." What is it, here.


AUSTIN: That is the bottom one, yeah. 


ART: Oops, I didn't get a card.


AUSTIN: Ooh. 


ART: Oh that's even harder to read!


AUSTIN: Ah.


ART: A bargain's mystical terms.


AUSTIN: Yes! Problem, boom.


ART: So who do we think has recently struck a bargain?


JACK: Oh boy. 


AUSTIN: Mmm. Either… I have two, I have three suggestions. One, the Crystallines could have made some sort of bargain, whether with the, the forest itself, with some sort of outside force that has gone bad for them in a way that they need help with, and they'll let us pass through if they— if we help them. Two, I have made a bargain. Uh, and the mystical terms are some sort of spell, it's, it, I think I've made a bargain with the sun? To go away for long enough for us to pass through? Or three, um, the bargain's mystical— I don't know how to get here, but where I'm getting to is, the Panther Queen is on our tail.


JACK: God! The idea of—


AUSTIN: That might be true anyway!


JACK: Yeah. I like the idea of making a bargain with the sun.


ART: Yeah, I also like the idea of the terms of your bargain with the sun having… a problem here.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes, well. You see, I did not read the terms closely. We sat down in a very well appointed parlor room, the Sun and I, and she said to me— "I know you're going through the crystal woods, it will be very bright, you'll have to confront the past and we both know we don't like to do that," And I said, you're right about that, do you remember that time? And she said "Shh." And I said of course, and I said, well, what if you simply… went on vacation. How many other worlds are there, could not another plane have a second sun for a day or two, or three. And she said "Oh yes, a vacation, I never get to take a vacation. I tell myself every year I will take a vacation this year, but I never do! There's always so much to be done!" And I said, well what if not today? And she says "Ah, but the work, it piles up. And it doesn't pile up—" She used a word I don't know. Linearly? Exponential? I don't know these words. What I do know is, after I signed the agreement, she said "Ah, yes. You will have your two days of darkness to pass through the Crystal wood." And I said, that is the thing I am here for, thank you! And I left. And then, her assistant came to me after, just to remind me, I suppose—


JACK (as DOMENICO): The Moon.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes, the Moon.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): The Moon, the Sun's assistant the Moon, we all, we've all read the stories.


[1:00:00] 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Mhm, the day after, the two days of darkness, it would be of course, five times the sun in the sky that day.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Fuck.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Which is, I suspect, too much sun!


JACK (as DOMENICO): That sounds pretty dangerous.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Yeah…


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes. … But those are the terms! Those are the terms of. Of this mystical bargain.


JACK (as DOMENICO): You had the Sun? In a, in a room with you?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes!


JACK (as DOMENICO): I would have captured her.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): No… you would have been charmed. The stories… her beauty!


JACK (as DOMENICO): Hm.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): I'm curious why the Sun… would, would think that you could make this bargain?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Maybe you've heard of me, my friend. Eze Ki'el. I am! Estecar! The Maverick Resplendent. She knows I have stolen many words, and some of them are mystical in nature. I suspect she simply wanted to see me… do the beautiful thing it is I do with these words and, find a solution  where there ought be none. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Okay.


JACK (as DOMENICO): How did it go for you? 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well, here we are, and it is time to do the solution, I suspect.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Hm. Sun's coming up.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): It was so good not to see any of the past and any of the mistakes I may have ma— may have made. Um. Especially this one.


ART: Well, it seems like it's time for us to cast a spell to get us out of this.


AUSTIN: That would be great. 


ART: Working collectively.


ART: Oh, select which words you want to commit to the spell, and in what order.


AUSTIN: Yes. Yes.


ART: So how do we do this if our words are a secret from each other?


AUSTIN: Oh I suppose, hm… collectively can mean a lot of things, right?


JACK: [cross] Oh boy. Yeah, so like, I, there's a minimum of one, so y'know, you could just cast a spell and that could be done with it.


AUSTIN: Right.


JACK: But we can put as many words in as we want, I believe.


AUSTIN: Correct. 


JACK: My proposal is that we commit words, and don't tell each other what they are until the spell has been finalized, at which point we reveal our words and narrate it.


AUSTIN: We also need to say— we do need to say if we're helping or hindering the…


JACK: Oh yes, that's true!


AUSTIN: The rules say, "As each player contributes a word, they describe how its meaning will help or hinder the spell."


ART: So we have to describe the meaning when we commit the word.


JACK: Okay.


AUSTIN: That's— I think we do. I think we do. [reading] "When you've completed writing the spell, the current player recites the words and describes its magic, rolling one six-sided die for each helping word, and one four-sided die for each hindering word. I'll note, actually I'll wait to note the thing until we're done with this. So, I would— 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): You are leading us, of course, Ki'el, and I would not want to step in front of your majestical majesty, and take this moment from you, this moment of heroism. Think, think of the way that you'll put a splinter into the eye of the magic pope. Mystic pope? Whatever it is. But I would love to help you.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): It's, it's both. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I see. I see. And so I will give you a word, but I suspect you should come up with the first word since it is your spell.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Yes, I will commit the word… 


ART: Did that work?


AUSTIN: Yes.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Alka. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Alka!


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Which as we all know, assuming we all paid attention in our, in our lessons, is the color of the first rays of sun at dawn.


AUSTIN: Ooh!


JACK: Ooh!


AUSTIN: Ooh!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well, then I know the perfect word to match yours. I will add the word destati, which simply means, destabilize. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): That's a wonderful word, thank you very much.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): And Baron?


ART (as EZE KI'EL): [cross] Baron Smokeacre?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Are you going to join us on this endeavor?


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well, I think you two have got this quite in hand.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I see.


JACK (as DOMENICO): And uh, I will enjoy the last moments of the nighttime. Over here.


ART: Okay.


AUSTIN: [cross] Yes, okay, well I think, yeah, mhm?


ART: [cross] Now I roll… a d6 for each?


AUSTIN: [cross] Well okay, let's talk about how this is gonna work first, because we're supposed to talk about how this will— how will this, how will these two things combine in such a way that if it works, it works well. 


ART: Gimme your definition again?


AUSTIN: Destabilize. 


ART: So I think that this is gonna, we're gonna destabilize the arc of the sun.


AUSTIN: Ooh, okay.


ART: And instead of getting five times the sun, we're gonna get five suns just peeking over the horizon.


AUSTIN: I see. Combining into one sun— or maybe even a little bit more than that, but not five suns' worth.


ART: Right.


AUSTIN: Love it. 


ART: So we're just getting a little bit of sun.


AUSTIN: Yes, yes, of course. Love it! Alright, so now yes, roll a six sided die for each helping word, and one four sided die for each hindering word. If one of the dice rolls a six, the spell is successful and the current player describes how the problem is solved. Otherwise don't worry about it, we'll get there.


ART: Sure.


AUSTIN: 'Cause you're gonna roll a six. You're gonna roll 2d6 and one of them's, they might both be siiixes— five and a four. 


ART: [cross] Agh!


JACK: Oof.


AUSTIN: [reading] "If none of the dice rolls a six, but one of the four—"  no four sided die, we don't have to worry about that. "If none of the dice shows their highest number, the spell is only weak and only partially effective. The current player describes how the problem is solved, but only partially or temporarily."


ART: I think instead of getting a whole day of this, it's just like, a very long morning.


AUSTIN: Mmm.


ART: Where like, you know those mornings where like, you look at the clock, and you're like oh it must be lunchtime now, and it's 10:15?


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: It's like that, but for real. Like the sun is really moving very slowly. So it's at a low angle, and it's not so hot, and it's not so bright, but it's going, and it will be, and we have to move quickly.


AUSTIN: I see. And it is still bad. Like in the, in the overall sense of like, you don't wanna have a day where instead of 24 hours, instead of there being ten hours of morning there are twenty hours of morning. But here we are. Or instead of four hours of morning, most mornings don't have ten hours, right, that's incorrect? [half in character] I've been so many places! So many worlds! So many other planes of being! Dimensions. Where the day lasts for ten hours! But this even, I've never seen, twenty hour days, ooh. So.


ART: If more than one words were committed to the spell, I gift one of the words to another player. And I would love to do that, but, it seems that my word has been.. It's just not here anymore? And it, did you see it?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I, no, wh— I don't even know what the word could have been. In any case!


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Well… maybe it'll turn up.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yeah, I would love for it to. [stuttering]  I don't have it! I tried just now to bring it back and eugh! Nope! Not, it is not there in my mind, my mind vault of words, mystical, magical, and otherwise obscure in nature. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Well, I suppose we just discard the other word and move on.


AUSTIN: Is that what actually happens, you discard the— so only the current player gifts a card, I see. 


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Yes, okay, well. Boom. I will note, the thing we just did, of passing the magical words around, if we wanted the game to be quicker, we could not do that, or uh, have a gifted word replace a word instead. 


ART: Hmm.


AUSTIN: But I like gift, I like gifting, gifting words, we can just play with it and see how it goes.


JACK: [cross] Yeah, I like gifting.


ART: Oh, and I'm supposed to take the location.


AUSTIN: Yes, that is your location now.


ART: To my hand, Okay.


AUSTIN: Yes. Alright, Jack. So…


JACK: So do we discard this problem as well?


ART: Yes.


AUSTIN: We do discard the problem as well.


JACK: I love to discard problems.


AUSTIN: I would love to. I would love to— so let me teach you how to do this real quick, Jack.


JACK: Yes.


AUSTIN: If you mouse over the top of the location— you see how the card pops up when you mouse over locations?


JACK: Yeah. Ah!


AUSTIN: If you— yeah. Then you can click and hold and drag it into the, into the middle of the play field.


JACK: Bang! 


AUSTIN: Where are we? We are… ah! Ooh!


JACK: Hm.


[AUSTIN laughs]


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Baron, where have you led us? Where is this place? I've been many places, this seems new to me!


JACK (as DOMENICO): Please don't worry. Don't worry about the dragon rocks. Don't, uh, that there is a, I think that's a man drowning, let's just keep going, uh, there's a shipwreck, I believe there's a sea serpent over there— I think, folks, we may have showed up at the Shores of Terror. Now, the Shores— now, the Shores of Terror—


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Who is— who is, who is Terra,  I don't know this Terra.


JACK (as DOMENICO): No no no, No, I don't think you understand. Uh, do you see— [laughs] Do you se all those dogs that are on fire?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes!


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Ahh!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes. Which one of those is Terra? 


JACK (as DOMENICO): No, no no. It's the fear. The fear that the dogs are giving me, by—


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Who is Fea?


JACK (as DOMENICO): How they— ah. Right. I see. I see. So you've never been afraid.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): What is… I've been abroad, I have been, I've been many things! Terror… Terreur? Terror. With an R at the end.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Watch your footing, those are knives.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Eeeh!


JACK: Now… here are the Shores of Terror, what do you hope not to find? 


AUSTIN: That is our prompt, the location is, The Shores of Terror, the prompt is, what you hope not to find.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well, I do have some bad news about some people I exiled to the Shores of Terror a long time ago.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Judging from where I stand on this promontory, with my spyglass, I can see that they have constructed some form of rudimentary, uh, castle and tollgate, through which, it seems, we shall have to pass. Now, uh, I… did not leave these people on the best of terms, they were several low-ranking dukes I decided needed to uh, remove themselves from my city—


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Isn't a duke above a baron? 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Not in my city.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I see.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Or, at least they were, until I exiled them to the Shores of Terror.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Hm! That is a way to handle a dispute about seniority.


[AUSTIN laughs]


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): The Baron is always so… straightforward, I appreciate it.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well, you know what I say. If I can't exile them, I kill them!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): A classic saying.


JACK (as DOMENICO): No, sorry, wait, the other— [ART laughs] Wait, wait, I have— I mean, if I can't kill them, I exile them. These proved difficult to kill.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Why— that's scary to hear, actually!


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Uh huh!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Speaking of fear, why were they, why were they difficult to kill?


JACK (as DOMENICO): Now, uh, generally I like to operate by a simple rule, belittle and divide. My belittlement and division did not seem to stick on these canny and uh, caring people. And they teamed up against me.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah.


JACK (as DOMENICO): I believe my words were… leave? This place? Before I call your armies, because I could belittle and frighten them.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I see.


JACK (as DOMENICO): And so we find them here, unfortunately we find them guarding what seems to be the only bridge out of the Shores of Terror, that is not currently being eaten by some sort of kraken.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Kraken, I know. 


AUSTIN: This seems to— I think I get what we don't, yeah, this is, I don't wanna find someone who wants to kill you, one of our travelling companions.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Oh, let me be clear, they would kill you too, they don't like me very much and anybody I'm traveling with is also considered…


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I suspect we're more travelling near. Adjacent?


JACK (as DOMENICO): No, no, I think with! No I think, they're with me! These people are with me!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I see. Well. That does sound like a problem!


JACK (as DOMENICO): Problem? And the problem, in addition to this is…


AUSTIN: Ah! Yes. Oh, great!


ART: The liches… so maybe you did manage to— are you sure you didn't kill them? 


AUSTIN: Are you— did they come back, is this the problem? The lich's corrupting influence? At least one player must contribute a hindering word!


ART: Oh, I guess the lich's corrupting influence is on one of us! 


AUSTIN: It is, this is why we must contribute a hindering word. 


ART: Hmm.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Mhm. There was one of them, Ladydraco… 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): How many words was that? 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Just one! Ladydraco. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Okay.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Ladydraco, I beheaded her on the steps of the castle, and now I do happen to see a terrifying figure clutching a phylactery. And a decapitated head, standing atop the battlements as we approach. This is not quite in my plan, folks. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): She certainly has no, no pull over you, though? No influence?


JACK (as DOMENICO): [stilted laughter]


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I— why is the Baron laughing like this? 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Perhaps they have a different style of comedy in the— in the Barony….


JACK (as LADY DRACO): [cross] Estecar! Eze! You dare trespass upon my terrain with the cursed Baron? 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): We— hm! Hah! Okay!


JACK (as LADY DRACO): It is I, Lady Draco, and that's two words! Once again, the Baron forgot.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Wait, wait. So, is it, if I can— ahem. Your acquaintance is met, Lady Dra Co, I am, of course, Estecar! The Maverick Resplendent, you know my name already. I have—


JACK (as LADY DRACO): Who is this cat?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): This is Eze Ki'el!


AUSTIN: Long gesture, my cape flowing as I throw back my arm!


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Heir to the ancient tribe of, of Leopard Wizards.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes! Can't you see it, by the way he wears his pants!


JACK (as LADY DRACO): Hm!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): As only a leopard would.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): They are well tailored!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Incredible!


JACK (as LADY DRACO): Say, who is your tailor? After I dispose of this terrible baron and your two miserable corpses, I need to find myself…


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Well, maybe we'll talk later, I don't feel comfortable saying now! 


JACK (as LADY DRACO): Hm.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): One question, Lady. You said it was two words, is Lady one of the words? 


JACK (as LADY DRACO): Yes.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): So it's Lady, and then, just for my notes— I collect them, words, you see. Draco, one word. Draco!


JACK (as LADY DRACO): Mhm.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Other word Lady. Not Lady, and then two other words, Dra and Co, or, Drah, and Eco! 


JACK (as LADY DRACO): No, no, it's too words.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Dr. Aco! Lady Dr. Aco! 


JACK (as LADY DRACO): No, I think I've been very clear.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I see. Well, Ki'el, I'm giving us time, we need to cast a spell and move on! 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Yes, um. Unfortunately, our… our betrayer has to start the.


AUSTIN: Uh huh! Yeah! Uh huh!


JACK: Oh, great!


JACK (as LADY DRACO): The baron, the Body that I have possessed, loathe as I am to admit it, for he's a terribly lazy man, he is a capable magician and now I will cast one of his spells!


ART: But you're giving the hindering word.


AUSTIN: Right, but you're doing the bad one, yeah. Are you trying to like—


JACK: Oh, I'm trying to kill you. 


AUSTIN: Oh, okay. Great. Good! 


JACK: Okay, I have cast the word… Drie. 


AUSTIN: Ah!


JACK: Which means… stallions! 


AUSTIN: Eugh!


ART: And that's gonna hinder us, the stallions are against us.


AUSTIN: They are against us.


JACK: The stallions are against you, yeah.


AUSTIN: Hey, what was that word you gave— or, hm, what was that other word you used before, Ki'el?


ART: Uh, alka is the color of the first rays of the sun at dawn.


AUSTIN: Okay. I just need it for my notes, first rays… I'm collecting uh, I'd just like to know what all the words— anyway. 


ART: Are you gonna give one or should, should I?


AUSTIN: I suspect we both may need to uh, try to combat this spell. So what was the word that you just used, Jack?


JACK: Uh, that's drie? Or drie (dree-ay)? 


AUSTIN: Which means…

JACK: And it means stallions. 


AUSTIN: Stallions. I see, I see. Do you have something in mind, here?


ART: Yes, I have, yarun, a massive emerald that contains the heart of an ancient dragon, whose name is forbidden to be spoken.


AUSTIN: Ooh! I Love this, this…


JACK: Wait. Sorry, hold on.


AUSTIN: Yes?


JACK: Do you have this emerald? Or is this just the name of that emerald?


ART: That's just the name of the emerald.


JACK: Okay, I see. You're like evoking the emerald.


ART: Yes. Who knows who has that emerald.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): And I am calling on the great power… of dalmar! Dog of the sea! Dalmatian of the mer. Mer meaning sea, and not meaning horse, in this case. Though actually, if I had left it more open, now would be a time to have horse magic, if ever there was. And I suspect what we are trying to do here, and you tell me if I'm wrong, Ki'el, is use the sea dogs, who are leaping from the waves of the troubled shore, now under my command! Brows affixed with blades, much like the Crystalline! It's a thing in this part of the world, I suspect, charging in to sort of, corral the uh, Lady Draco—


JACK (as LADY DRACO): Hark, do you hear, the sound of hoofbeats across the sands! One thousand horses!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): [cross] And if I could separate— Oh no, the sea dogs and the horses will mingle and give you the time, my good friend, Eze Ki'el, to, to cast this… emerald spell. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Yes.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Okay.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Yes, we must trap the Lady Draco in, in our own version—


JACK (as LADY DRACO): No!


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Of the ancient emerald yarun. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Of the ancient emerald, yes, yarun! I love the word. Yarun! It makes me— yaruuun! It makes me wish to howl, alongside the sea dogs, which I have— I would be clear, they are not pirates!


JACK: Are we sure? 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): They are mer-dogs. Perhaps they've done some piracy, but I suspect not as a vocational trait. 


ART: So their back is a, Is a… if a dog was gonna be a mermaid, would it be like this? Or like this?


AUSTIN: [cross] [laughing] Like this or like this!


ART: Do all four legs have little fish tails at the bottom?!


AUSTIN: I think they— [laughs] I think they have like, flying fish water wings? And they have sharp teeth. And they can only howl when they're underwater.


ART: Oh, that's so sad.


JACK: [warbled howl]


AUSTIN: That's it, yeah, they did it, that was it! That's them! You have to roll these dice. So it's 1d4, and then 2d6. 


JACK: Okay.


AUSTIN: What we don't wanna see… is… that d4 to be a four—


JACK: [cross] A four!


AUSTIN: Without there also being a six. 


JACK: 1d4… 2d6. [roll20 bwoop] 


AUSTIN: Well, the 1d4 is a two. You have to separately roll the 2d6.


JACK: Wait, I have to separately roll them? Okay.


AUSTIN: Yes, yes. Oof. That's a four! I mean, it doesn't matter. So, this is, [reading] "if no dice show their highest number, the spell is weak and only partially effective, the current player describes how the problem is solved, but only partially or temporarily." Thomas Whitney in the chat says "isn't a mer-dog just a seal?" I don't… wanna talk about it.


JACK: That's actually… It's not wrong, is it? "No!" Shouts the lich, the Lady Draco. 
 
AUSTIN: Yes.


JACK: In the voice of the Baron and also atop the, the things—


JACK (as LADY DRACO): Ah, you are trapping me! You have trapped me in the, in the thing! 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): The Emerald of Yarun, give it respect!


JACK (as LADY DRACO): Sorry, I'm sorry, in the Emerald of Yarun!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): But not the real one, because of course, I don't believe Eze Ki'el has the…


JACK (as LADY DRACO): No, no.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ki'el, is this…? Correct, you don't have the Emerald of Yarun. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): No, I wouldn't even know where to find it.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I see, I see.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Probably in an…


JACK (as LADY DRACO): You've trapped me in this emerald, and… but, I have not been sapped of my power! Instead I have been bound to the knapsack of Eze'kiel, like a kind of awful thrall! And I've been cursed to accompany you upon your journey! 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well!


JACK (as DOMENICO): The good news, folks, is that I seem to be fine now. I have been de-possessed, and glad to see that we've trapped her where she belongs, in that emerald. And now we just have to cast it into the sea, and we can get rid of it, right?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah, well, yes. Uh, unfortunately you may have missed the small, the small fact of the curse, which has affixed, affixed her, the emerald, to our good friend Ki'el's knapsack.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): And the Crystalline pattern of the spell has made my backpack inaccessible, so I'm gonna need to borrow rations from the rest of you until we can dispel this.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah, of course, well.


JACK (as DOMENICO): It does seem, however, that uh, free of the leadership of our Lady Draco, the cowardly dukes have done exactly what I thought they would, and fled back towards the forest. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well! We've made it through another one.


AUSTIN: Is anyone, are you gifting any words, Jack? 


JACK: I was going to, but one of them has just disappeared!


AUSTIN: Oh, yes, of course. It's a shame. It's a shame what happened to the Emerald of Yarun, I lost it in the mist. Certainly if we had that card, we could've uh, sorry, if we had that word still, whatever it was, the Emerald of Youuwho?


JACK: No, no, it's drie, it's drie. 


AUSTIN: Oh, it's drie. AH.


JACK: It's the horses!

AUSTIN: Oh, it's the horses. Disappeared! Not like the Emerald of Yarun, which was simply used up. But we remember. 


JACK: And has sealed the backpack of Eze Ki'el. 


AUSTIN: Yes. Yes, of course. Yarun was… what was yarun, yarun was restorative. 


JACK: It's the gem! 


AUSTIN: No no no, I'm trying to put it in a discard pile.


JACK: Oh, I see.


AUSTIN: We're good.


ART: Oh no, it was profane.


AUSTIN: Oh that was yours, that one is yours.


ART: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, okay, okay. Boom. Yeah, okay that's right. Okay.


ART: WE don't talk about the emerald that has the dragon's heart.


AUSTIN: Right, I see.


JACK: No, yeah, of course. Its name cannot be spoken.


AUSTIN: It cannot be. Alright. And so, our travel continues. In this fucked up game that is, not a dark mirror, not a black mirror, but like a funny mirror, version of Fall of Magic, we're continuing. I draw the location of our next venture. That location… Ithra Zaya! 


JACK: Oh no!


AUSTIN: The ruins! 


JACK: Not Ithra Zaya! 


AUSTIN: The ruins… of the first, the first Church of Magic's original settlement. We should also move these to… wait, you take this location, Jack. You take the shores. 


JACK: How do I, how do I put it in my hand? Oh, take card.


AUSTIN: Yes. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): [clears throat] And so we, we come over the hilltop, below us, you know, we've crossed the shores of terror, we come over the hilltop, and there, in the distance below us, in the valley, is Ithra Zaya! The vast ruins of the original Church of Magic, and the city which rose up around it. And inside, it says what lies within the ruins, are hundreds, no, that's too slim a number, thousands, maybe more! Tourists. Visiting this ancient site. Filled to the brim with souvenirs, and security guards, filled with people, dressing as their favorite members of the Church of Magic, so that they can so petitions to the wonderful lords of the mystical and profane! They probably don't say profane 'cause you say profane. Ithra Zaya! It is a coliseum here, it is a chapel there, in between hordes of people! In our way. And all of them so… cheesy! Each of them, unbelievably corny! 


[ART laughs]


JACK [as TOURIST]: Oi, you wizards?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes, we are wizards!


JACK [as TOURIST]: Oh, I love wizards!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): [offended] I am a— oh, a maverick resplendent!


ART [as TOURIST]: You all have the best costumes! 


JACK [as TOURIST]: Oh, thank you!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): [furious] These are not— oh, these are vestments of the occult!


JACK [as TOURIST]: Do a trick!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Do a trick? They— do a! 


ART [as TOURIST]: Did you get those off of, what's that? Um… the, the Etsy?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): The etsy. Couldn't even pronounce it right. There are seven characters in the name of [guttural word that sounds like etsy]!! And you don't even know how to pronounce half of them! Yes, I summoned these robes, mystical, from a distant plane, where they were handcrafted out of only the most organic of materiel!


JACK [as TOURIST]: Do a trick!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Do a trick. 


ART [as TOURIST]: I couldn't afford to take a plane here. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Couldn't— I have no, I have no ire at your poverty-stricken lives! The poor are born that way, and in a more righteous world, poverty would itself be stricken from existence, but we do not live in righteousness, do we? Do we? 


ART [as TOURIST]: No I, I come from the, the township in the north of the Leopard Queen's jungles?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Oh, I see! I see! My name is… Michael, then. When you go back, you say you saw a wonderful wizard— I will do a little trick for you, and you will forget that this has ever happened! [nervous laughter] You certainly have never met Estecar, Maverick Resplendent! No such being exists in your mind! In fact, all you'll remember from today is what a wonderful time you had, some ice cream,  a delicious snack! 


[pause]


AUSTIN: We should…


ART: [cross] So are you gonna, you gonna produce an ice cream?


AUSTIN: Yeah, well yeah, of course I produce an ice cream! I mean what I'm actually gonna produce here is a problem card, which says… Deadly beauty! [ART and JACK laugh] ….God. I think I know what the deadly beauty is here. And I do this magic trick, and it all happens so quick. That the first thing you notice is that I'm apologizing to you in a jail cell. Because we've been arrested for doing un, un, what's the word I'm looking for, we don't have our, we don't have our busking papers, basically?


JACK: Oh, unlicensed? 

AUSTIN: Unlicensed magic in, in the Ruins of this fuckin place, Ithra Zaya, and the, we've been brought before the deadly beauty that is the Mystical Pope. Who is here, in Ithra Zaya, for his, one of his many, you know, appearances. And I think it's a great PR thing for him to quickly pass judgement on some evil mages, which they've decided we are?


ART: Wait, can I get a, can I just, can I twist this a little, flavor-wise?


AUSTIN: Please, obviously! 


ART: Um, so this is a tourist trap city, and what if this is like a residency show in Vegas?


AUSTIN: Oh, love it.


ART: What if this is like, like how Britney Spears goes out and plays all the hits every… every night?


AUSTIN: Yes, yes! Love it. The pope—  the Mystical Pope comes out and does, every, every night, just does like, let me show you how this shit goes, let me just, let me make this little ball move around or whatever, like I do, I don't know what the fuckin' Mystical Pope does, corny shit. 


ART: Yeah, it's like a corny magic show, and then it's like, and then it switches to like a weird Judge Judy?


AUSTIN: Yeah, exactly, we have a special guest for you tonight! Like that style of like, ladies and gentlemen, you're not gonna believe the show you have in front of you today. Most people only get to see the disappearing ball trick, but for you all, you're all here to see a judgement and execution of three heretical mages! Yaay!


JACK: Fucking hell.


ART: Woo!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Now listen, my good, good friends. What we've seen on our traversal so far is we all have uh, a history? And we all have um, moments of… misfortune! I wouldn't say—


JACK (as DOMENICO): I don't have any. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Misfortune, not mistake! I did not lay blame at your, at your feet.


JACK (as DOMENICO): No, I've never been unlucky.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I didn't say unlucky, I said misfortune. These are different things, these are different words, you know this. You know this to be true!


JACK (as DOMENICO): Fine, fine.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): There's no such thing as a synonym.


JACK (as DOMENICO): [mumbling] Fine.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): [unintelligible mumbling] Anyway, I suspect that we can find our way out of the mystical realm of Ithra Zaya. Somehow. When they lead us out onto that stage, the people there will not know that what we do is real magic. They will think they are being entertained, and so, we will conspire to wow them! Amaze them! And then sneak out the back. And I have just the word to lead us. Do I have you, my kin in the mystical arts?


JACK (as DOMENICO): Yes. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Of course.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah, good, yes, yes. Then. Just follow my lead, yes? Hello, pope?


ART (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): [simultaneous with Jack] Yeees?


JACK (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): [simultaneous with Art] Bonjour. 


[laughter]


AUSTIN: The dual-voiced pope is here! 


ART: The pope speaks with two voices, one in French, and they don't say the same thing! That's what this pope does! 


JACK: [cross] Do they have two heads?


AUSTIN: [cross] For this adaptation of Friends at the Table's Spoken Magic, yes, exactly! 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): How are you today, my friend?


ART (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): I… am well.


JACK (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): Je suis bon. 


ART: [in Magical Pope voice] Sometimes they say the same thing. 


[AUSTIN and JACK laugh]


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well, I… Ahem. It seems only fair for us, in our estimation, I know this is in line with some of the traditions in legal-ese and such, that we demonstrate for you what we were doing and you can see that it was not unlicensed magic at all. Ahem. 


ART (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): … Well?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well, you have heard, of course, of the Emerald of Yarun, yes? 


ART (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): Of course I have!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): [cross] But no one knows where—


ART (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): It resides in my foyer! [foy-er]


JACK (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): Oui. 


AUSTIN: [laughs] Didn't get the pickup! Amazing! Perfect! 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I believe you mean foyer. [foy-ay]


ART (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): I don't speak French!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes, of course, no, of course you don't. Well, as the legend goes, there is an emerald, and there's a great dragon— no— you know where the emerald is, apparently, and the dragon will be there—


ART (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): Yes, yes, I put it on top of my mail when it comes in so it does not blow away when people come in the door!


JACK (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): [french accent] All our post.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): That seems a wise enough reason— way of using an ancient relic. Well.


ART (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): It is heavier than it looks because it contains the heart of the dragon.


JACK (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): C'est très gros. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Do you know— Hm. Oui.


ART (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): Very gross! 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): There is also the Ruby of Ezer, isn't there? Now… no one knows, no one knows what happened to the Ruby of Ezer, because once, there was such a thing that you could simply hold the ruby, and it would give you whatever it wished. Whatever you wished! It would bring into being whatever dream the holder had, then one day it was empty. Simply one more pretty rock. Well, that is, people here gathered in Ithra Zayn? Ithra Zayn! Because I, Este— Michael! I! Brought the spirit from the rock out! This is Ezer, Ascended Spirit!


AUSTIN: And a big, red, angry looking spirit being emerges from, from my mouth! Like whoo, like I'm Gotenks, like I'm making a Gotenks ghost? Don't worry if you don't know what that means, except it's a big angry red ghost, that I stole from the ruby that used to hold it. I don't have the ruby, and I can't put anything into anything, but what I have is the fucking ghost itself. And, here it is! 


ART: Is Ezer the name of the ghost or of the ruby?


AUSTIN: Yes. 


ART: Okay. I was looking at my list of words… Jack, if you have a word, go— yeah.


JACK: [cross] I am going to— yeah. I am going to cast… hm. Ooh, boy. Oh, oh, yeah no, I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to cast, um, tis. Which means, grain. And as everybody knows.


AUSTIN: Yes.


JACK: Look, as everybody knows, any object passing through a ghost becomes a ghost. 


AUSTIN: Of course! Lesson three.


JACK: Is what they say. And so a shower of, of thousands of… kernels of grain, tumbles from the ceiling, it almost looks like it's been dropped off the flytower, passes through the ghost, and then just rises up into hundreds of small grain…


AUSTIN: Ghosts.


JACK: Grain-shaped ghosts. Yeah, are they ghosts of grain? Or are they…


AUSTIN: Hm, you'd have to get closer, wouldn't you?


JACK: I don't know! Yeah, and uh…


AUSTIN: Perhaps this will keep the audience busy as we make our escape.


JACK: Yeah, exactly! 


AUSTIN: Yes.


ART: And then… we could use another word, right?


AUSTIN: Yeah! Yeah, we can use up to three..


ART: Well I was just asking, do we need… I will add… simmirond, which as we all know, is the name of the lake in the primordial garden that infused all things with life, and it will make the ghost grain… [AUSTIN and JACK gasp] into little grain people ghosts that run around— 


AUSTIN: [laughs] Oh that's not where I thought it was going! 


JACK: No, no!


AUSTIN: That's wonderful! Unbelievable! 


JACK: Wow! I didn't know you could do this! 


AUSTIN: Well, I mean roll those dice, I guess.


JACK: [cross] Eze's amazing!


AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah, this is incredible! There's a six!


JACK: Yes!


AUSTIN: If ever we've deserved a six in our lives!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): And as you can see, all of this is all very licensed, all on the up-and-up, goodnight! Tip your waitress! Let's get out of here!


ART (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): What is! I didn't see a license!


JACK (as THE MYSTICAL POPE): Mon dieu! 


AUSTIN: And as the little grain people are running around, we make a break for it. They cover our escape through the, through the back— I think the thing that happens here is even the people who run the show are convinced that this was all… an act? And they're all clap clap clap clap clap! They drop the curtain like, it's they raise it for an encore, and we're gone! 


JACK: Now, Austin.


AUSTIN: Yes. 


JACK: Do you want to give any of your words to anybody?


AUSTIN: Well, i have to, I believe, I think the current player gifts one or more of the words to another player. I am going to— y'know, it's tough, because Ezer is such a powerful word, that I hate to see it leave my hands and go into someone else's, but I do know that I think a great spirit like Ezer needs to remain in circulation. And so I am gifting it to you, my friend, Eze'kiel. You can take this card into your hand, where it belongs. 


ART: Thank you very much. 


AUSTIN: Tis was restorative, and simmirond was…?


ART: Profane.


AUSTIN: Profane, there we go. Someone wants to know in the chat here, Frank in the chat says, "Do the runes on the cards mean anything?" And the answer is, up to us. We totally could draw on those, in terms of like how we're describing stuff? Like, those are there as like, a prompt for the players. But I don't know that they… I suspect one of the reasons that we have not used them, is because they're very tiny, and we're playing online, and I didn't get a chance to like, really look at mine when I was coming up with names, or coming up with words. So. They're very cool, and I think you could do a lot with them. We've not had any overlap, had we, in terms of what those symbols are, yet. 


JACK: I don't think so.


AUSTIN: I'm peeking, I don't see any onscreen currently, but… There's some very similar ones, which is very fun, like I like this middle one being a little bit different. I guess they're all— are they all like? Sort of like, variations on… anyway, we can't fall down this road, we have another location to go to! Art. Nope!


ART: [cross] This is my location. 


AUSTIN: Oh is this yours? It is yours, yes.


ART: Yeah. 
AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Also, briefly, um, Ki'el, I am, I hope the encounter with the Mystic Pope was not too… troubling.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Well as you can see, I was completely struck speechless.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I did, I did! Scary.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Traumatic, yeah.

AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Normally you're so… loquacious.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Yeah.


ART: Oh boy. The card is: Meadow Eternal: A promise. 


AUSTIN: Ooh. 


ART: [in a soothing tone] And the Meadow Eternal lives up to its name, once you are within its borders, all you can see in any direction is the rolling, easy, meadow. With the long grass, and a distant, the distant cry of the bleating sheep. You never see a sheep, mind you, but you hear it. You can't quite see the way you came in. You can't quite see the way out. But the land… Speaks to you. Stay here. Everything will be okay.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well, this is it then, isn't it!


ART: We promise.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): We made it! A wonderful journey, I've had with both of you fine gentlemen, I will be staying right here. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): I have decided that I'm gonna open a new baronetcy.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes!


JACK (as DOMENICO): It's gonna be here in the field.


ART: The meadow… calls.


JACK (as DOMENICO): In this meadow. I'm going to open it up—


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah!


JACK (as DOMENICO): You're all more than welcome, you can all be dukes.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah! Well— Hm!


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Wait, wait.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Wait! I suspect I would be better as a simple, loyal servant and, citizen, of your great—


JACK (as DOMENICO): Dukedoms to you all! And I'm kind to my dukes. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes, I know that, I know that from history.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Yeah… 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Just…


JACK (as DOMENICO): Just! Absolutely, just kind to my dukes, no more.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Do dukes get to take naps?


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well, dukes get to take as many naps as they want, unless I need them to be awake.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah.


ART: You can't imagine needing to be awake here. What could you possibly do?


JACK (as DOMENICO): Now, I do feel quite sleepy.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Me as well! I, I think I am going to curl up here on this precious, precious little hillock, and let the sun's, the beautiful beams of our good friend the Sun, whisk me away to sleep. Oh, what a wonderful meadow! 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Do you hear a sheep?


ART: [cross] There's sun on the—


JACK: Oh, I'm sorry. [laughs]


AUSTIN: Yes!


ART: No, no, it's fine! The sun on the meadow would never make a bargain with you. It would only give you exactly what you want. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Okay, well that—


JACK (as DOMENICO): Yes.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well okay wait, now wait, that does not sound like the sun to me. The sun I know is always trying to get one over on you, that is why she is so hot!


JACK (as DOMENICO): Hmm.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I don't mean that in terms of her beauty, which, she is beautiful, I meant in terms of the heat. She always puts the heat on you.


JACK (as DOMENICO): I mean it in terms of her beauty.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes, well. 


AUSTIN: I think, I think you should draw a problem— oh, I should also get rid of this problem card from last time. 


ART: I hope it fits with the very clear theme I've drawn so far!


AUSTIN: Yes! Ah! Well.


ART: The haunting what?

AUSTIN: Past. 


JACK: Oh my god. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): I feel like I'm slipping into a dream.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I would prefer not to, but I also do. Ah. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): I don't wish to sleep here, it feels so… cozy. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well, it was nice chatting with you fellows, I… I'm just going to think about the good old days. Of which there are numerable. As many days in my own luxurious past, illustrious past is what I meant to say, but also I'm luxuriating here in the paradise around us! As many days as there are, little, little grass… what are they, what are they called? Grass blades? Grass leaves? Grass…


JACK (as DOMENICO): Sticks. Sticks of grass.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Little sticks of grass. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): [cross] [mumbles] Little sticks of gras…


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Oh, yes. There I am on my… fifth birthday, a crown on my head! And my thirtieth. A crown on my head. ...I celebrate every fifth year by getting a nice new crown made, I try it on.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Oh! You're not telling us anything about you're life, you're just. Buying crowns.


[JACK laughs]


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): [cross] Well, I— I have a few, I have a few.


AUSTIN: [pause] The end! And then they died because—


JACK: [cross] And then they died!


AUSTIN: [laughing] Because none of them could rise to the challenge of overcoming the Eternal Meadow, or whatever! Who casts a spell to save us?


ART: Wait, we could, we could, we could… put a finer point on the problem.


AUSTIN: Yes.


ART: The haunting past—


AUSTIN: Ah.


ART: Could be that we all, we all slumber.


AUSTIN: Right.


ART: And wake up with… with perhaps some of… some of Estecar's pursuers upon us.


AUSTIN: I see.


JACK: Ooooh. 


AUSTIN: Yes! Yes. I like this. Literally. Those pursuers are, of course, the Panther Queen, El'len, and her many people. And, they come roaring into the uh, the Meadow Eternal, I'm guessing?


ART: Yeah, yeah, then just like…


AUSTIN: You can hear the sound of sheep being scared, but you can't see them.


ART: Uh huh!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): [gasps] Rouse yourselves! Rouse yourselves!


ART (as EZE KI'EL): What?


JACK (as DOMENICO): Is that the sound of a sheep being scared? 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): That sheep is very scared, and the only thing that scares a sheep such like that, are the forces of El'len. The Panther Queen.


ART: Does anyone have an Ellen impression?


AUSTIN: I do not have a back pocket Ellen… Sometimes it's nice to be good to dictators! I don't know, I got nothing, I don't…


JACK: I like tennis in, in really weird circumstances!


AUSTIN: What's the price of milk? 


JACK: [laughs] Being in my house is like being in jail. 


AUSTIN: Um. 


JACK: Well, fuck, I guess she can't sound like Ellen. 


AUSTIN: I guess she can't, we don't have one.


ART: Well… she doesn't have to talk.


AUSTIN: [cross] She doesn't have to— yeah, I, yes. She may not even be here at all. Well.


ART: Right. Well, we said she— she could be in her… what's a, is it palaquin, what's the?


AUSTIN: Yeah, I know what you mean.


ART: Yeah, the like, little hand… limo?


AUSTIN: Yeah. Palanquin. [palan-kin] Palan...quin? Palanquin. [palan-keen] 


[[Automated voice]]: Palanquin. [palan-keen]


AUSTIN: Palanquin, palanquin. Yeah. Being carried. Question, is El'len, a panther? 


JACK: … Sure, right?


ART: Well, I mean, it'd be weird to be queen of the panthers and not be a panther, yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure, okay, uh huh. Okay. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): We— as much as I love this place, we need to leave, friends. El'len is leading—


ART (as EZE KI'EL): [cross] They'll be upon us before we know it.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes. I haven't, maybe brought this up to you all, but though the jungle is my home, it was also, as I mentioned, one of the first places to put a warrant out for my arrest, and my return. And so, it is— El'len has taken it upon herself to retrieve me for some reason, I couldn't say why, and we should go.


JACK (as DOMENICO): But she won't get us, right?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): No. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): So we can just go? 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well, no no no, the thing is, if she caught— okay, so. The thing about…


JACK (as DOMENICO): We could just go, Ezzie, towards that sheep.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ezzie, Ezzie? Ezzie. I helped you when we came upon your diabolical foe. Foe, the Mystical Pope. And, Baron? I was there with you when the terrible Lady, what was, what was your name again? Lady...


JACK (as LADY DRACO): Lady Draco! 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): The horrendous, despicable—


JACK (as LADY DRACO): You can't open your backpack! Just try!


ART (as EZE KI'EL): I know, it's very annoying! 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Lady Draco is here, I would ask you, do me this favor, and help me here in this moment of need.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Hm. Hm! Hmm. I will do it. But I will remove your dukedom.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): This is a high cost, but my freedom, my freedom is worth at least this much to me! 


JACK (as DOMENICO): [cross] You're clearly very sad about it.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): [cross] Alright, we should cast this— we should cast this spell.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): This is what we do. This is what we do best! Is what I always say. 


ART: There's two words I think are very good and I'm having— I'm struggling to choose. I will choose… gul. 


AUSTIN: Gul.


ART: Which is the pull in the heart of every person, to turn away from the face of God.


AUSTIN: Oof.  Yeah. Friends at the Table, come get it.


JACK: Holy shit.


AUSTIN: Come get it!


JACK: Yeah! Just when you think it's not one of those episodes, it is!


AUSTIN: Uh huh, it is!


JACK: It's the person writing the definitions, wasn't sure which episode we were making!


ART: Yeah. Well, I had to make a profane word, so I had to…


JACK: Oh yeah, absolutely!


AUSTIN: [cross] And I will— I will, I will add to this. That moment, the moment of turning, what if it was eternal as well. What if, with the mystical power of the word I stole from the great philosophers of Alacah! I say quadroninus! Quadrio-in-ouisness! Quooooo…


JACK: Say that one more time?


AUSTIN: Quodrionius! Nope!


ART: [laughs] No "I" there!


AUSTIN: [laughs] Ahem! [half in character] What I meant to say, sorry, I was sleeping. 


JACK: Quadrionius… 


[laughter]


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I mean what I say and I say what I mean, what I say is: Quodrionus! Which, of course, means to question. We'll trap them there in that moment of faithlessness, of doubt, forever! They will question whether it is they believe in the faith of the Mystical Pope, if they believe in the, the deit— hm. Deific nature of Her Grace, the Sun, if they simply worship the, the mundane godliness of the Panther Queen, and they will just be stuck in that question indefinitely.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Oh, I was just thinking we could just get them to turn their faces away from us.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): That would've been simple too, but now I've extended the spell, haven't I?


ART (as EZE KI'EL): [doubtful] Yeah, okay, yeah.


JACK (as DOMENICO): I have never understood philosophy. I've killed many philosophers.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah.


JACK (as DOMENICO): I'm going to cast the spell mekinos. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): One more time?


JACK (as DOMENICO): Mekinos. Mekinos. And this spell of course, just means island. So, uh. Many great islands are going to rise from the meadow, causing these people to become trapped in a physical maze, as well as an acumedical one. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): See, you do understand it. You though you didn't, but give yourself credit, Baron. Of all the Barons I've ever met, and I've met quite a few! You are the wisest in natures of the heart. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Oh, excellent!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): And faith. And also in faith, which is where I was going originally, but then I spoke the truth, which is that your heart is pure and good!


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well, that's not true.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Hm. Well. 


AUSTIN: Let's roll some dice.


ART: Oh my god!


AUSTIN: That's okay, there's no fours, we didn't roll, this is still a mixed success.


JACK: [cross] No, this is good. If this was Blades in the Dark, we would not be doing well at all.


AUSTIN: No, Blades would be, oof. But no, no hard success, so how does this go mixed for us? 


ART: It's that they… they look away.


AUSTIN: Uh huh.


JACK: They fear God.


AUSTIN: Or do they!


ART: And they… 


AUSTIN: Question!


[JACK laughs]


ART: And they look, but they look back, and that is what quad— quodrionus—


AUSTIN: Quodrionus. Yeah, see, it's not so easy, is it!


ART: They look toward us forever.

AUSTIN: Ohh.


ART: And the islands that we thought would distract them, all the roads seem to lead to us.


AUSTIN: Ah, well.


ART: But they're, theyre winding, and it's time enough for us to get away.


AUSTIN: Right, of course. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well this is troubling. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Mhm.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): My friends, I do believe we have given ourselves a long life of trouble. And it is time that I come to tell you the truth about myself. [pause] Which is that trouble just seems to follow me everywhere!


[ART laughs]


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well yes, I've often thought that about you.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes. Anyways! 


JACK: Slaps you on the shoulder!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Hahaha!


ART (as EZE KI'EL): You've got like, misfortune!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Uh, well. I would say unluck.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Hmm.


AUSTIN: We should uh, does anyone, who gets a card here?


ART: I think that I want to give the Baron Smokeacre, I want to give quodrionus. 


AUSTIN: Quodrionus.


JACK: Quodridronious? 


AUSTIN: Quodridronious.


ART: Quodrionious.


AUSTIN: Quodrionionous. If you do it right, it sounds like the hook to an Outkast song.


JACK: Yes! What… what does Quodrionius mean?


AUSTIN: Question. 


JACK: Oh, okay. Quodrionius…


AUSTIN: Oh sorry. Wait no gul is not mine, gul goes where?


ART: Uh, gul is…


AUSTIN: Jack's. Which is second?


ART: No, gul is mine.


JACK: [cross] No, no no, gul is Art's, I think.


AUSTIN: [cross] Oh, gul is yours. Okay, there we go. I could do one more, if y'all are up for it, these go pretty quick.


JACK: Yeah.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Let's do one more.


JACK: Yeah!


ART: I'll take that placecard, I'll move the problem.


AUSTIN: Yep.


JACK: Okay. And I will draw… a location! And the location that I have drawn is…


AUSTIN: Hmm. 


JACK: Tomb of Leyla Glass! Glass!


AUSTIN: Glass…


JACK: Tomb of Leyla Glass…


AUSTIN: And the prompt is… tradition and ceremony.


JACK: Tradition and ceremony. Hmm. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): I killed a giant, once. Not this one, of course, this one has died a long time ago, and much much smaller than my one. But this one is still pretty, pretty bloody big. That up there looks like it's a tower, that's its foot, we can climb up it with a ladder. Of course, the tomb has been built on the body of the giant, and the ceremony that I think we all have to do is pilgrimate from the foot up to the head.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): [groans] Pilgrimate…


JACK (as DOMENICO): Yes, and uh, deliver a gift of some kind, I don't, I've never given a gift, and make it up to the head. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): You've never given a gift? 


JACK (as DOMENICO): No. No, gifts…


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Never?


JACK (as DOMENICO): No, gifts are for cowards. Giving them.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Couldn't you have simply… given away something that was given to you that you didn't find much use for, like a re-gift? 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well, that's just giving someone something.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well it's, I like to think of it as passing it along. You've never had it, because you never wanted it to begin with.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Of course.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Like if you ordered, ordered the fish and chips, but didn't like chips, which I'm not saying you did not—


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well, I'd give the chips to the dukes.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah, but you wouldn't give them, because you said you didn't like to give anything, you would simply let them have your chips!


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well I— the dukes would have the chips, yes, yes.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Right, but you wouldn't have given them, certainly. Have you done something…?


JACK (as DOMENICO): [cross] No, no no.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Have you ordered the dukes to eat the chips?

AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well, I'd say something like, Dukes? Chips! But I can't say that anymore because I don't have any dukes anymore. They're all...


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well that's not true, uh, Ki'el of course is a duke, you made Ki'el a duke just a moment ago!


JACK (as DOMENICO): I made Ki'el a duke? 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Yeah!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Did you not? 


JACK (as DOMENICO): [cross] Oh. Well!


ART (as EZE KI'EL): You made both of us dukes!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Not me! I was, my dukedom I gave up in noble exchange for the, the assistance of our great Baron in the matter of the Panther Queen.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Can you give away a dukedom?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well I simply, uh, I didn't do anything in fact. The Baron…


JACK (as DOMENICO): I withheld it.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes, withheld it.


JACK (as DOMENICO): I withheld the dukedom.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well yes, of course, yes. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): You can't have it.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): See?


JACK (as DOMENICO): Because uh, you can't. But you can, Ki'el, I suppose. Uh, anyway, up the giant we go.


JACK: So now I'm gonna draw a problem.


AUSTIN: Hey, is there a, are you good at climbing up things, Ki'el? I guess so!


ART: Yeah!


AUSTIN: Leopards climb all the time, yeah, okay, fuck off Austin! Think through the shit you say!


JACK: Yeah, Austin!


ART: Way better at jumping than you, too.


AUSTIN: Well.


JACK: Biting, swimming! Smelling. Seeing in the dark.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: The problem that we—


ART: Batting things around. 


JACK: Yeah! Is…


AUSTIN: Ah! Ah, well! 


JACK: Hm! 


AUSTIN: Make that bigger.


JACK: Okay, we have drawn… Heimd— Heldinhar! [AUSTIN laughs] The slumbering dragon.


AUSTIN: Yeah! 


ART: Curled up, nestled next to the body of the giant.


AUSTIN: Of Leyla Glass. 


ART: Of Leyla Glass. In the crook of the arm lies the slumbering dragon.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Was it Leyla's pet, do you think? 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Those records are lost to us.


JACK (as DOMENICO): I know. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): You do? 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Yes, it was her pet.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah, see. As I suspected. I could see, it has a certain… pet-like quality! Loyalty.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Hm.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Dignity.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Sleepiness. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes, a vast, a vast, countless amount of sleepiness!


JACK (as DOMENICO): Vast, profound amount of sleepiness.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes, I am quite sleepy again, aren't I. Whew. Just looking at that dragon makes me wish to doze off!


[JACK laughs]


ART (as EZE KI'EL): In many ways, you are the pet of the journey.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Thank you for the compliment, it warms my heart to know that I am cared for, and that I will get treats at the end.


JACK (as DOMENICO): I say, lads. Think the dragon  might be waking up.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well, we have an answer for that, don't we! Baron?


JACK (as DOMENICO): Um. Um, we do? 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): ...Yes. Ahem. Hm. Ah. Well. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well we do, and I'm sure that I will stumble upon it, in the time between the dragon clawing its way up the torso of the giant, and towards us.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I didn't think it would move so quickly! I thought perhaps—


JACK (as DOMENICO): It's moving very quickly.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Do you suspect that we brought the wrong gifts for Leyla?


JACK (as DOMENICO): What did you bring?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Roll on the gifts table! 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well I know what I brought, I brought what I bring all of the many giants I've visited over time. I've brought a word of magic!


[distant sirens]


JACK (as DOMENICO): Oh, oh!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Sorry for the sirens, the Panther Queen draws ever nearer. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): I see. I see your thinking.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Maybe I've brought the wrong one, is my fear.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): I brought a bouquet of flowers, but it's in my bag…


[AUSTIN laughs] 


JACK (as LADY DRACO): You can't open it! I've eaten those flowers!


ART (as EZE KI'EL): You ate the— !? I just thought you were spiritually trapped there!


JACK (as LADY DRACO): [eating noises] 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah well, now that I think about it, I didn't think this one through. Ahem. So maybe we don't even need to go over what I've brough.


JACK (as DOMENICO): What have you brought? 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah. You— who brings anything, really?


JACK (as DOMENICO): Looks like you're trying to cast— [laughs]


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Andun!


JACK (as DOMENICO): Looks like you're trying to cast andun! 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Andun! Well, there was a sorcerer, who… 


AUSTIN: As we're running away from this dragon, we're hiding in a room, we're in a safe, we're in like a safe room, we found a little room, the dragon is like, clawing its claws into various other places. This whole thing is just a dream-like wonderscape in my mind. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): There was a sorcerer, whose name I've since forgotten, as is the way, who used to cast the most marvelous of rituals. And at the end of each one, as it came to its conclusion, there was a sort of— do you have a deck? Do either of you have a deck? Do you have a deck, Baron? Like a wooden, like a deck?


JACK (as DOMENICO): [cross] A deck?


ART (as EZE KI'EL): [cross] Like a wooden deck?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Like a wooden deck?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): In my garden?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes.


JACK (as DOMENICO): No.

AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well. Eze? Easy? Easy. Ezeh? Ki'el? Eze! That's what it is, it's Eze, it rhymes with Jeze! Now I'll remember it. Eze, do you have a deck?


ART (as EZE KI'EL): I have a sunning post, but I wouldn't call it a deck, perse.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well, when you have a deck, do you know what the final step is, before barbequing?


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Sealing it? 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Sealing it, finishing it! And so the sorcerer would finish off his spells, you see. And so, and he would go alakazam, or whatever words, I don't have his words, do I? And at the end, he would say andun! And he'd be done, and it would finish, it would lock the spell in! And so I thought maybe, it's a tomb, you want to keep the person entombed, you don't want them getting out, you want them to be stuck there! Hm, stuck is the wrong word.


AUSTIN: Roar, claw claw claw!


[JACK laughs]


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I thought maybe it would be best to keep the tomb intact, and I thought maybe I could finish it with the great word of andun! 


JACK (as DOMENICO): [hums] Okay. I fear I have also brought the wrong spell.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah, well.


JACK (as DOMENICO): As an offering. Making us, two for two, so far. I have brought the word spell… hinla!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah. Ah, hinla.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Ah, hinla. I noticed that uh, they had many scaffolding for climbing all over the giant, many uh, snack shops. Many uh, coffee shops. And I figured that these people might appreciate me casting the word industriousness. However… 


JACK: Talons break through!


[AUSTIN laughs]


JACK (as DOMENICO): I fear all I may have done, is uh… uh! Made it a little worse in terms of what the dragon feels capable— or willing— to do. 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Certainly not as bad as what I suspected you were going to say, I thought that you were going to say that you have somehow resurrected the giant inside of the tomb, which I then locked further inside of the tomb, that would've been horrendous. A symbol— 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well!        


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Oh?

JACK: At this point, the angle of the room shifts!


[AUSTIN laughs] 


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Well, um. Those flowers would be wonderful now, if we could somehow open your knapsack. Have we considered taking a knife to it?


JACK (as LADY DRACO): No! You can't!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Just cut it from the bottom, yes?


JACK (as LADY DRACO): No!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): We just open it. And then we can tie it off the other side with a rope, and then open it as we will. 


JACK (as LADY DRACO): I don't understand your plan, and it won't work!


ART (as EZE KI'EL): There you have it, it won't work.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Ah well, I suppose it's just our spells, then. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): And unfortunately, none of my spells can be used here to utter… my words on this ground, could cause the…


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Right.


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Untimely resurrection of the giant.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yeah, well. About that.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well!


AUSTIN: I think these might be two hindering spells! 


JACK: Yeah, these don't look good, do they, Austin? 


AUSTIN: No! I think this might be 2d4, and we just don't wanna see a four. 


JACK: Sure, okay, let's do it! 2d4.


AUSTIN: Hey, no four!


JACK: So the total is a four, but the actual value of the dice?


AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah, It doesn't count, it's fine. Yes, yes. That's, we thankfully have not yet failed a roll, so yeah, this spell is weak and only partially effective, the current player decides how the problem is solved but only partially or temporarily. 


JACK: Hm… I think… that. So we've managed to cast two, okay, right. "Well, you know, folks, I think that we should be very grateful," says the Baron as we are walking down the road, twenty five minutes later. 


[AUSTIN laughs]


JACK (as DOMENICO): That in a moment of animated industry, the andun spell landed upon Layla Glass's hand, and she reached out and trapped the dragon beneath it, before falling back into death once again. We have, however, desecrated a tomb, but uh, it's not the first time.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Nor will it be the last, am I right, friends?


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Hah!


JACK (as DOMENICO): Nor will it be the last! 


AUSTIN: Who wants the spells, who gets a spell here, or word? 


JACK: I, I, it's gone again!


AUSTIN: Ah. Well.


JACK: I can't, I can't!


AUSTIN: Is that hinla or andun? 


JACK: Uh, it's hinla. 


AUSTIN: Okay.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes, well, I'm sure if we ever need the spirit of industrious again, it will find its way to our tongues, yes?


AUSTIN: Alright, I think that does it for our first game of Spoken Magic.


JACK: What's the— do we have a final image of these three losers?


AUSTIN: Oh my god. Do you wanna draw the next location card, and then we'll end on whatever that is, that seems fun.


JACK: [cross] Oh yeah, you narrate the arrival, yeah.


AUSTIN: Make sure you take your location.


JACK: Oh, sure. 


AUSTIN: Alright. Let's see… Ah. 


ART: Ooh.


JACK: Ooh!


AUSTIN: And so, from the road we find our way to a little port town, and uh, ahem. If y'know, I think Estecar says:


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Friends, I have uh, a real admission to make now.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Hm.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): This is a real one, I'm not going to pull your leg like last time, yes?


JACK (as DOMENICO): Is this a real one?

AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): This is a true and real thing. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Hm.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I have, and this is a hard admission to make. I have commissioned us a boat. Or wait that's not the, that part's fine, that part didn't need to be framed like it was an admission of guilt, uh, I got a boat, we have a boat.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Right, I was going to say.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes, of course, now. Now. Do you know about the Gilded Reef? 


AUSTIN: Arm extended, from the top floor of this pub, this cafe, whatever. Y'know, it's uh, kind of a seaside vibe, and I gesture out to the sea, which is glowing with gold from the gilded reef.


JACK: Like a mareel. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh huh.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): The Gilded Reef! Well you know it, of course.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Is that the gold one?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes, yes it is, well. That is, of course, my… [mumbles] So. And I'd like to go get it.


JACK (as DOMENICO): I'm sorry?


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): I said, that the Gilded Reef is my… [very quietly] Inher… itance. My inher… the Gilded Reef is my inheritance. And I would like to go get it, because of being of age, now, uh, an adult. 


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): It is now mine that I can take, and it is no longer under the watchful eye of my parents.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Bloody good job! That sounds fantastic! Made of gold!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Yes. It's quite big.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well! Suppose we better get started!


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): Now, I will say this does… this has to be between the three of us, because I think it maybe calls into question some of the stories people believe about my humble beginnings, pulling yourself up by your bootstraps and that, and I would prefer— as a symbol of hope to the many, many people, the many fans of Estecar, the Maverick Resplendent! That that stay in their brains, because one day they will wish to be a Maverick Resplendent perhaps, and if they knew that you had to be an heir to the Gilded Reef to become one, they wouldn't even try, and where would we be if that was the case, so, I, uh, would just like to go get it and take it away, the Gilded Reef, so that no one can track us, track it back to me. And I'll share it with you of course, because you'll be helping me.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well. Well.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): The boat leaves at five.


JACK (as DOMENICO): Well you have my help.


AUSTIN (as ESTECAR): It's a little early, that's the other part of this mission, is a little early it seems to be at the boat at five because you have to get out there kind of, you know how the waves are. So see you then… [nervous laughter] Pina coladas on me. Piña coladas. 


ART (as EZE KI'EL): Well I can't see what could possibly go wrong here. 


[laughter]


JACK (as DOMENICO): Folks, it's time to steal a reef!


AUSTIN: Welcome to Friends at the Table!


ART: I mean you should draw the problem now.


AUSTIN: Yeah, well! Let's draw the problem and we'll sleep on the problem. Something forgot to mention! [laughter] Oh, I have never drawn a more perfect card in my life! The second adversary, no, throw it out! Throw it out! 


JACK: Something you forgot to mention!


AUSTIN: [in Estecar's voice] Ah, well! Hm! 


JACK: Hm!


AUSTIN: Alright, on that note, we'll be back sometime soon hopefully, to wrap up this game of Spoken Magic, a wonderful game that I've had a blast with so far.


JACK: Yeah, this is great!


ART: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Absolutely. Thank you all for joining us, we will be back again hopefully soon, I'm gonna do my best to get up the last Drawing Maps hopefully tonight, if not tonight then tomorrow, it's a little out of date because it was for the previous arc, it was for the SBBR arc in Orzen, and then hopefully this coming week, maybe even tomorrow, I'll do a Drawing Maps for this past arc of Partizan, if you have questions, you can send those questions for Drawing Maps into tipsatthetable@gmail.com, with "Drawing Maps" in the subject so look forwards, to that.

JACK: Bye!
