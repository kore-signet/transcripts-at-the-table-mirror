KEITH: I’m recording sneezes, I guess it’s broken.


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: Hi, we’re back.


JANINE: Hey.


JACK: I hit undeafen and the Twitch channel would’ve just heard you say “It’s just ‘cause I’m recording sneezes.”


[ALI And JANINE Laugh]


JACK: Um...


ALI: Me and Keith were just having some, y’know—  like, game strategizing.


JACK: Oh, some planning? Some plans and some strats?


ALI: Y’know, just talking about how the game’s goin’.


JACK: Yeah, that’s important.


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: Especially for— do—  you know, this den of thieves that is Dax and uh… and Darren.


ALI: Mhm.


JACK: So.


KEITH: Everything’s going so wicked, super good.


JACK: Everything’s going wicked super good. I’m very safe.


[JANINE Laughs]


KEITH: Mhm.


JACK: So, let’s load up the Tilt. Here we go: we’re gonna read about the Tilt because it is kind of fiddly. Uhh let’s put Chrome back on screen. As Act 1 wraps up you'll have some dice in front of you as the result of the preceding scenes. Roll them all and add all the Black dice altogether and all the White dice altogether then subtract the higher from the lower. Okay. So, now is this—


JANINE: Hang on, isn’t— I thought there...which ones were we rolling?


JACK: We're rolling our own. [KEITH: 12.] We’re rolling our own dice.


JANINE: Oh, right then.


JACK: The ones in front of us. So everybody rolls the dice in front of you—


JANINE: You can just right-click them, and then multi-sided, then random side.


ALI: Yeah.


JACK: Right-click.  Multi-sided. Random side. Okay.


JANINE: How did I get two fuckin’ 1’s?


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: Then you want to—  [Trails Off Into Laughter]


KEITH: Are you 0? You got a 0?


JACK: Add all the black dice together— 


ALI: Uh-huh?


JACK: Add all the White dice together, and then subtract the higher from the lower. [KEITH: 12.] For example, if you have one Black and White die, a roll of 6 and 4 respectively— that’s 2 Black… why is it…


JANINE: Your— [Laughs]


JACK: So Janine...you have 0 [Laughing] It says here, umm…  [Laughs] Cool. Uh, I have uhh…. Subtract the….subtr— subtract the higher from the lower.


KEITH: Mhm.


ALI: Oh.


KEITH: So you’re— Jack, you’re 4.


ALI: 4 White.


KEITH: Ali, You’re 7.


ALI: 7 Black.


KEITH: 7 Black. I’m a 12 White.


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: Why are you a 12 White? Shouldn’t you be 0? Oh, ‘cause you added them together!


KEITH: No, I have 2 Whites. And you add the Whites together and then subtract the Black, which I have none of.


JACK: No, subtract the higher from the lower.


KEITH: No but you only—


JANINE: Blacks and White separately.


KEITH: Right.


JACK: Oh, I see… Man.


KEITH: Yeah, so I did it. I have the highest possible roll I think.


JACK: Okay, so—


KEITH: I guess I could’ve had three dice, that’s possible.


JACK: The player with the highest White Total—  that is... Keith— and the player with the highest Black total— which is … uh …


JANINE: Ali [Laughs]


JACK: Ali [Laughs] Cool!


ALI: Uh-huh.


JACK: I feel great about this.


[JANINE Laughs]


JACK: Each gets to choose Tilt elements. The Tilt is a standard list of details, just like Needs, Objects, and Locations. But this time, it represents disruptive, game-changing events, people, and impulses. Roll the unused dice in the central pile. I'll do that. You’re gonna want some random numbers.


ALI: Okay.


JACK: Gonna reroll these… now I finally got some 6’s.


KEITH: Okay.


JACK: Okay.


KEITH: Is this in the Zoo, or is—  this is in the Zoo right? The Zoo PDF? Or is this in the—


JACK: No, this is in the Fiasco rulebook.


JANINE: No, I think this is in the—


KEITH: Oh I couldn’t find it.


ALI: Oh I put it in chat. I’ll put it in chat again.


JACK: Page 56.


KEITH: Page 56, okay.


JACK: “Use the results of the roll to pick elements from the Tilt list— as during the setup— with each high scoring player choosing a general and a specific element. This is a good time to ask for input from other players, who may have really good ideas. It is also a good time to privilege your character’s big finish. Pick Tilt elements you’re excited about and that have the potential to take the game in an intriguing direction. You’re injecting trouble so don’t be shy. Write the new details on their own index cards and put them in the center of the table. These are fair game for anybody and are not relationship-specific. Chances are, everyone will know right where they belong. And you reassemble the dice pile.” Then it says take a break, but we did that. And then we play Act 2.


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: Which is the same as Act 1, but instead of giving dice to people we… uh… y’know. Take them for ourselves.


KEITH: So we each do one? Ali and I do—  each do one?


JACK: You each pick a… category and a… a sort-of a complication from within it.


KEITH: Yeah, okay. Okay so Ali, I want… we … as the high scorers— no how about— I’ll open this up to everybody I don’t wanna close this off.


JACK: Hang on, I’m just trying to find the Tilt table...


KEITH: This is where we— so we have a 6 and we have a 1. Which means we can— we hafta decide right now if uh this lion plan is a stupid plan [JACK: Here we go.] KEITH: Executed to perfection, or if it’s not.


[JACK And ALI Each Take A Breath]


JACK: So, we should say before we decide this, that the categories on the Tilt table are:


1. Mayhem
2. Tragedy
3. Innocence
4. Guilt
5. Paranoia
6. Failure


KEITH: [Coughs] Yeah.


ALI: [Takes A Deep Breath] So— [Laughs] Okay.


KEITH: There’s a lot of different kinds of failure here.


ALI: Yeah, I—


KEITH: But! “A stupid plan executed to perfection” is kinda the only positive one? That like, really really fits with what we’re doing. So I think we hafta like… either pick that, or knock it out immediately.


ALI: Okay, yeah. ‘Cause I’m kinda-of torn. If we’re using the 6’s i’m kinda torn between that and “Fear leads to a fateful decision” which is [Voice High-Pitched From Laughter] really—


KEITH: We can do both— oh we can’t do both.


ALI: [Disappointed] Yeah.


KEITH: We can do two different 6’s. We can do. Like, uh… “Stupid plan executed to perfection” AND “You thought it was taken care of but it wasn’t.” OR “A tiny mistake leads to ruin.” We could do both of those [Laughs]


ALI: Yeah.


KEITH: So, we can have two failures if you want.


ALI: [Laughs] I, um...what’s the rest of the table think? ‘Cause I am fine with this— [Laughing] This plan. Being executed perfectly.


[JACK And KEITH Laugh Hard]


JANINE: I think it’s interesting if the thing that we’re dealing with in Act 2 is not the plan itself, but the aftermath of the plan.


JACK: Yeah and so we should—


JANINE: The plan itself goes perfectly. That doesn’t mean everything else does.


ALI: Yeaah!


KEITH: Also, there’s two other plans that can end in disaster.


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: So we should also pick a— so if we pick 6-1: “A stupid plan executed to perfection” and  then we pick uh… how many of these are we making? Which is...


KEITH: Two, right?


JACK: Two, right?


KEITH: Yeah. We’re doing two, yeah.


JACK: So we should—  Yeah, we should pick “A stupid plan executed to—” Oh! the last dice is wild as well, that is a good point.


KEITH: But we don’t have— We don’t use the last dice we’re using… We’re not using all of these dice right? We’re just using fo—


JANINE: No it’s—


KEITH: Four.


JACK: It is just four right?


KEITH: Yeah, so we don’t have a last die in this case.


JACK: Okay. Okay.


ALI: Yeah, I’m looking through this list.


JACK: So, I feel—


KEITH: Mayhem is a fun one: “Magnificent self-destruction; A dangerous animal gets loose; um....


JANINE: Innocence is “A well meaning stranger intervenes” is also interesting.


JACK: Yeah.


ALI: Yeaah! [Excited] I also really like Innocence: “The wrong guy gets busted”


[Everyone Laughs Hard]


JACK: Oh, that’s potentially really good. Because… because that— I love that because  6-1 suggests that—  like you said—  this is gonna go off without a hitch and then—


KEITH: Yeah.


JACK: 3-3 “The wrong guy gets busted.” That, despite the fact that it goes without a hitch, a hitch finds an innocent guy.


[ALI And KEITH Laugh]


JACK: I mean, do we want to do that? Do we want to do… Failure: “A stupid plan executed to perfection”?


KEITH: Oh, we… we can’t do 3-3, we don’t have a second 3.


JACK: Oh, but people in the chat—  Andrew Potson— points out the fourth dice counts as the last dice. Like, the last dice that you would commit to the tilt is wild.


KEITH: Okay. Yeah that’s fine.


ALI: Okay, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Um… yeah I’m trying to look through this list to see… what like— “A sudden reversal” is interesting, but I do really like—


JACK: All of theses are so good! [Laughs]


ALI: [Laughter Overwhelming] The wrong guy gets busted!


JACK: Yeah!


KEITH: What’s it— Oh, also we have—  5-2 goes really well with 6-1: “What seems like dumb luck isn’t. Things are afoot.”


[ALI Gasps]


[JACK Laughs]


[ALI Laughs Excitedly]


JACK: That one’s also really good. [ALI Laughs] That one’s also really good.


ALI: [Catches Breath] Oh wow…


[Silence]


ALI: I hate making decisions [Laughs]


JACK: I’m on team—  I think I’m on Team Stupid Plan Executed to Perfection; Wrong Guy Get Busted.


ALI: Okay.


JACK: I think that’s where I fall.


KEITH: Mhm. Um… There’s also like… Keep in mind, like, not to focus too much on the lion plan. That’s my lion plan, not—


JACK That’s true.


JANINE: Yeah, there’s other stuff planning.


ALI: Yeah, there’s so many plans happening. [Laughs] Everybody has a plan. Um… [Pause] Yeah, I think... Yeah. “The wrong guy gets busted.”


JACK: There’s lots of things the wrong guy could get busted for.


ALI And KEITH: [Simultaneously] Yeah.


ALI: Who’s the wrong person?


KEITH: There’s also reasons why someone would get busted for something. There’s lotsa wrong guys. Sometimes the wrong guy for one thing is the right guy for something else.


ALI: [Laughs] Okay.


KEITH: Or we could just find someone who’s totally innocent!


[ALI And JANINE Laugh]


JACK: Um...


ALI: I’m gonna go for 3 and 3, unless.. You know. If anyone else—


JANINE: It’s your call.


ALI: Yeah, okay.


KEITH: Yeah, I have no additional—


ALI: Okay.


JACK: So, we should probably write this down somewhere on the screen right?


ALI: Yeah, lemme see. Oh we need a new… y’know what?


JACK: Like, an index card or something.


ALI: Oh, that’s not a— [Laughs]


JANINE: I can just put a new index card in, it’s not that hard.


ALI: I thought I would write on top in red, so that we’ll always see it.


JANINE: You do not see red on brown.


ALI: [Laughs] True.


JANINE: That would not quite work out. [ALI Laughs] I’m gonna put it in this top corner here. Ba-doop. Ba-doop.


[Pause]


JANINE: [Speaking While Typing] “A stupid plan executed to perfection.” [Loud Typing] Aaand...


[Pause]


JACK: The wrong guy gets busted. 


JANINE: Copy and pasted.


[Typing]


JANINE: Do we… Do those die go back in the middle or no?


JACK: Yes, all the dice get returned back to the middle, at this point.


ALI And JANINE: Except—


JACK: Oh, oh! Except for our dice, yeah yeah yeah. [Laughs] God, that was close.


[JANINE Laughs]


[Pause]


JANINE: It’s like, an even split.


KEITH: So the way dice work is a little bit different this time around, We don’t distribute them?


JANINE: No, we keep them.


KEITH: We keep them. When someone gives them for our scene, it is ours.


JANINE: Yeah.


ALI: Oh, but we’re still assigning them, it’s just that we keep them.


JANINE: You do not see red on brown.


ALI: [Laughs] True.


JANINE: That would not quite work out. [ALI Laughs] I’m gonna put it in this top corner here. Ba-doop. Ba-doop.


[Pause]


JANINE: [Speaking While Typing] “A stupid plan executed to perfection.” [Loud Typing] Aaand...


[Pause]


JACK: The wrong guy gets busted. 


JANINE: Copy and pasted.


[Typing]


JANINE: Do we… Do those die go back in the middle or no?


JACK: Yes, all the dice get returned back to the middle, at this point.


ALI And JANINE: Except—


JACK: Oh, oh! Except for our dice, yeah yeah yeah. [Laughs] God, that was close.


[JANINE Laughs]


[Pause]


JANINE: It’s like, an even split.


KEITH: So the way dice work is a little bit different this time around, We don’t distribute them?


JANINE: No, we keep them.


KEITH: We keep them. When someone gives them for our scene, it is ours.


JANINE: Yeah.


ALI: Oh, but we’re still assigning them, it’s just that we keep them.


JACK: Yeah.


ALI: During somebody else’s scene, I mean.


JACK: Yeah.


JANINE: Mhm, if it’s somebody else sets a scene, then it still gets assigned.


ALI: Okay.


JACK: Okay. [Laughs]


ALI: Hello.


JACK: You’re up I think.


ALI: Yeah uh… It’s either Establish or Resolve?


JANINE: Mhm.


JACK: Yes.


ALI: And um… [Laughs] Do we wanna— did we want to start this? Like, y’know. [Laughs] The video’s been posted at this point, or do we wanna go… a little farther? Like, stay with the lion a little longer?


JANINE: I think um… for the way this is, we have— we can say that like… the… [Takes A Breath] If it’s “A stupid plan executed to profession— perfection— the wrong guy gets busted.” Those things have to have happened.. So I don’t know how much farther we want to get away from that because the aftermath is what our scenes will probably be about.


KEITH: Oh, I was thinking we wanted to see the plan on screen.


JANINE: I don’t think we can do that because then you wouldn’t be able to give it a Black die, because it’s written in as “A stupid plan executed to perfection right?”


ALI: Ohhh.


JACK: Ohhhh. Hm…


JANINE: Or on the other hand. I guess executed to perfection mean success.


JACK: Yes that’s true


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: There are lots of different criteria for success.


JANINE: The plan itself can go perfectly, but other things are happening at the same time? Uh… I don’t know.


JACK: I say we do it. I say we...y’know, play to find out what happens, knowing it’s also “a stupid plan that’s gonna go perfectly.”


[ALI Laughs]


JANINE: Hmmm.


KEITH: And we’re all here for this?


ALI: We’re all here.


JANINE: I think so.


ALI: Um… [Takes A Breath] Okay, uh… [Uncertain] I think I’m gonna Resolve? Am I still allowed to do it at this point? If we’ve— established as a group? Now we just play the scene and then…?


JANINE: I guess, yeah. I guess we all have decided what the scene is, so yeah.


JACK: Yeah.


ALI: Okay, cool, cool, cool.


JACK: So it’s—


JANINE: So, Never I think is there with her phone out. Like she is…


JACK: Have people have shown up?


JANINE: She has a DSLR for this, or something.


ALI: Ooo!


KEITH: Was this, uh... an advertised— It was like an advertised show right? Like…


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH: There’s a bigger cras— ‘cause it we had to have some sort of pretense of—


JANINE: Mhm.


KEITH: We’re letting someone in. Someone won a contest to pet the cat.


JANINE: Yeah, yeah. Totally.


KEITH: Everyone come watch this guy pet the cat!


[JACK Chuckles Lightly]


ALI: Yeah. Yeah, okay. So it’s like one of the— yeah, it’s... Yeah, a performance.


KEITH: Yeah.


[ALI Snickers]


JANINE: I imagine Never did like a fake Twitter, like, “Retweet and follow for your chance for whatever” and then like… it said like “Oh yeah, this guy won! It’s cool for him!”


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH: I’m in the ca—


Keith (as Dax): I’m in the cage! Everybody, eyes on me! This is Dax! I’m in the cage!


JACK: How is this—


        KEITH (as Dax): In this enclosure!


JACK: So, how—


        Keith (as Dax): Question?


JACK: Oh [Laughs] I, Jack, have a question. We know this is…


KEITH: Oh, okay.


JACK: This is framed as Darren’s scene as well. So I wanna know what Darren’s doing at this point


JANINE: Mhmm.


ALI: I think at this point, Darren is… he’s like, behind the scenes at this point. He’s the one who is— [Laughs] The last scene I had had a little bit of confusion. Are we still doing a fake black lion? Or are we gonna use a real lion who’s sad.


JACK: This is a real [Laughing] This is a real bummed lion.


KEITH: Oh did we switch at the last minute?


ALI:  Well y—


KEITH: We’re using the sad lion?


ALI: Yeah.


KEITH: That hates Boots?


ALI: Okay no, the conflict was, we’re still using the black lion, but the sad lion is there as a complication.


JACK: Oh like he’s in the...like he’s hanging out?


ALI: Right, yeah. Okay okay. I was just getting that info for myself. But regardless, that, y’know, he’s setting the lion up. He’s making sure the mane is tight. Uh [Laughs] [JACK Laughs] He has some like, general leopard care tips.


KEITH: Doing some spots spray paints.


ALI: Mhm yeah. Just doing some touch-ups with a smaller paintbrush. Airbrush works, but you gotta get the details in. [Off-mic]  Wow. Really? Don’t do that. 


[Distant Irritated Meow]


[Everyone Laughs]


KEITH: Valid response.


ALI: Nah, you gotta stay still. I hafta paint you [Distant Meow] Stop it! I hafta paint you!


[Everyone Laughs]


[Distant Meow]


[KEITH And Jack Laugh Harder]


JANINE: Perfect, I love it so much.


KEITH: What a silly meow. That cat has such a silly meow.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Bonjour!


KEITH: Mrooow.


ALI: I know [Laughs] Yeah, but I think he’s trying to— he trusts Dax. Y’know, Dax is center stage here. But back stage is important. Crew is just as important. Krew with a k. [Laughs]


JACK: Okay.


ALI: Okay.


JACK: We just cut back outside to Dax doing Hugh Jackman’s The Greatest Showman.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): I am Dax Leopard, The Leopard Shepard! The most famous, popular, coolest, zookeeper at the zoo.


        Jack (as Crowd): Horrraaaayy!


Jack: Says the crowd.


        KEITH (as Dax Leopard): And I need— thank you. Got a special guest with me today.


        JACK (as John): Hi, it’s John from Bluff City Tribune.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Oh, it’s John. John from the Bluff City Tribune. Question, yeah?


JACK (as John): I was wondering about— could you talk about the safety measures that are in place for this interaction today?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yes. absolutely. I have a very commanding presence with the cats.


[Pause]


JACK (as John): That’s it?


[JANINE And KEITH Laugh]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah, these are incredibly intelligent cats. They’re great cats, says right on the marquee.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): And there’s a sprinkler system in case of fires.


[JACK Laughs]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): There’s a sprinkler system in case of fires. There’s emergency exits.


[Distant Meow]


[JACK Laughs]


        KEITH (as Dax Leopard] And we did— with our winner, we did do an intensive cat-behavioral training session.


        JACK (as John): [Content] Good enough for me.


        KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Thank you Jack from the Bi-... What is it?


        JACK (as John): Um, my name is John, and I’m from the Bluff City Tribune.


        KEITH (as Dax Leopard) Bi… Bluff City...


        JACK (as John): Tribune.


        KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Tribune! Okay! Now I’m bringing out Mister— drumroll please!!


[Banging On Desks]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard) [Whispering] What’s your name? What’re we gonna be calling you?


        JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Whispering] Francoise.


        KEITH (as Dax Leopard): This is Misssterrrr Francoise!


        JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Whispering] Bonus!


        KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Thomas Francoissse!!


        JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Whispering More Loudly] Bonus!!


        KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Bo— Francoise’s Bonus!!! [KEITH Laughs]


        JACK (as Boots Bonus): Bonjour.[1]


[ALI Stifling Laughter]


        JACK (as Boots Bonus): Yes, it’s me!


KIETH (as Dax Leopard): Okay, and you are gonna wanna be making a little bit of noise, to let the cats know that you’re here.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Hi.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): A little louder!


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Hi! [Meek] I’m sorry. About what I did.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): What? What did you do?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): I’m talk— don’t worry. [Whispering] I thought maybe if I apologized— 


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Oh you’re— sorry, Canadians are very polite, it’s fine. They’re y’know, always apologizing for stuff.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Loudly] I’m sorry about your wife!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Oh, you don’t hafta apologize—


[Everyone Laughs]


ALI: Boots, the other lion is there staring at you. Trying to attempt to make eye contact.


JACK: I’m just staring at the floor and apologizing.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Okay, so— Fra— Thomas Francois[2] Bonus, do you wanna give this lion a hug? This is the fa— the Famous New Mexican Black Lion!![3]


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Yeah. [Uncertain] S— sure… I’ll give this lion a hug.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Whispering] Darren! Cue the second lion!


[ALI Laughs]


KIETH (as Dax Leopard): [Whispering] Give him a pep talk!


ALI: You see Darren— [Laughing] You know how zoos have those fake walls in the back? And it’s usually like—


JACK: Like “Oh, these are brushes!”


ALI: Darren pokes his head out between two rocks or whatever, and is like:


[Brief Pause]


ALI (as Darren): Sick shirt bro.


ALI [Laughing] To Boots.


        JACK (as Boots): [Whispering] Thank you. Thanks.


ALI: [Laughing] Tosses like, a— god what is it? It’s like a parchment paper— you know how when you go the deli— [Distant Meow] Wow. [JACK Chuckles] You get deli meats like [Laughing] wrapped up. And he just tosses one of those out like, halfway between you and the backstage area. And then like, a lion comes sulking out towards this like—


JACK: A fake lion right?


ALI: This thin cut ham. [Laughs]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Oh, we do have a second lion here! This is unplanned. Everybody stay calm.


        JACK (as Boots): Oh no!


        ALI (as Onlooker): Oh, who’s that!?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Just keep hugging and petting the Famous New Mexican Black Lion, please.


JACK (as Boots (as Francois Bonus)): Yes, I am Francoise, and I feel great about this situation. I’m a little frightened of the other lion. The New Mexican One, and the other one.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Everybody in the audience give a little cheer! Cats love the noise!


        ALI, JACK, JANINE (as Onlookers) [Clapping] Hoorray!!! Woo!!


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH: And the lion, who recognizes Jack— who recognizes Boots Bonus—


JACK: This is the fake lion, right? Or the real one?


KEITH: No, you’re hugging the fake lion. The real lion is now headed towards you.


JACK: [Laughs] Okay.


KEITH: It recognizes you and knows exactly what you did to his wife.


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH: And he’s going to try to attack— he’s going— he’s not happy with you.


Jack (as Boots Bonus): Oh no.


KEITH: He jumps on you, and he’s roaring, and he goes in for a bite, and I go:


        DAX: Thup thup thup! Lion! Thup!


[ALI And Jack Laugh Hard]


KEITH: And the lion looks at me, and looks back, and gives you a hug.


JACK: The lion gives me a hug? [KEITH: Yeah] The lion who I did dirty?


KEITH: Well, he’s listening to me. He doesn’t like it.


JACK: Ohh, he’s still—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard) LION! Thup! Thup!


[ALI Laughs]


JANINE: So the lion’s like, side-eying Boots as he’s resting his head on your shoulder.


ALI: Like, hisses in your ear, y’know?


JANINE: [Laughing] I don’t think Lions hiss! None that are known for it anyway.


KEITH: If you’ve ever picked up a cat before that doesn’t want to be picked up, and it’s just [Low, Irritated Growl, Akin To An Engine Running]


[Everyone Laughs]


KEITH: It’s like that in your ear but it’s a lion doing it.


ALI: [Laughing] Wait—


JANINE: This is all scientifically accurate, for sure.


ALI: Which dice is bad again? Black is bad?


KEITH: Black is bad.


JACK: Black is bad.


KEITH: Is there a die in play?


ALI: I’m deciding.


JACK: The crowd is just going wild, right?


JANINE: Yeah.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard) Thomas Francois Bonus, do you wanna give the new lion a hug? This lion seems to be warming up to you!


JACK (as Boots Bonus) No.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard) No? You wanna keep hugging the Famous New Mexican Black Lion, everybody! Let’s hear it!


        KEITH (as The Crowd): YEEAAHHH!! LOVE IT!


JACK (as Boots Bonus) [Uncomfortable] Yep. Mhm. Mhmmm. A hundred— yep. I’m sorry. I’m sorry about your wife


[Everybody Laughs]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard) Let’s give it up for Canadians everybody! [Claps] Okay, Thomas Francois Bonus, you can head back to your seat. Lion! Thup! Thup!


        ALI (as Darren Cruise) [Whispering] The attack! You forgot the attack, bro!


KEITH: No the attack already happ— we already did that. That already happened.


ALI [Laughing] It didn’t!


KEITH: Yeah, the lion was going to attack him and I did a “thup thup thup” and he— the lion gave him a hug instead.


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


ALI: Okay [Laughs]


KEITH: Do we wanna rewind? Do we wanna focus more on the attack? Do we want the lion to have knocked him down and licked his face instead?


ALI: No. No no, it was a stupid plan exectuted to perfection. The crowd was tense and then the tense moment had passed. I… [Takes a breath] It’s weird ‘cause I don’t know how to read bad and good, right?


[JACK And ALI Laugh]


ALI: I feel like it could just be a Black die and y’know... The bridge is still burned between you and the lion. But I don’t know if it counts as what this game is? [Laughs]


[JACK And JANINE Laugh]


KEITH: I mean, you chose to resolve right?


JANINE Well, that’s a failure for Boots, right? Like, Boots went in there— Boots wants the lion to forgive him. [JACK Laughs] And that hasn’t happened.


JACK: Has not been forgiven by the lion, no.


JANINE: Yeah.


ALI Right, Well— yeah. [Laughing] [Cross] Maybe you just give him the lion wife and I—


KEITH: [Cross] BUT! Ali— Darren wants to get away with cutting corners.


ALI: Right. Oh, that need isn’t also mine?


KEITH: Oh, but I guess you have both of these. So I guess we’re deciding which one of these is more... happening.


ALI: Okay.


KEITH: It’s me Dax! [Using Dax’s Voice] “Which one is more happening!?”


[Everybody Laughs]


ALI: O— [Laughs] ‘Kay. ‘Cause I feel as far as my desire to get away with cutting corners, the hitch went off perfectly. But the guilt [JACK: Mmm!] of my not having the respect of this lion leaves me unable to feel that this is a victory.


JACK: Right.


ALI: So I felt I understood that lion’s true emotion. [Laughs]


JACK: [Thoughtful] Mm!


ALI Um…


KEITH: Yeah, that lion hates you.


ALI: Yeah that lion hates you


KEITH: Well, specif— yeah, hates Boots.


ALI: Hates Boots.
KEITH: As soon as it looked into your eyes it knew what you did.


ALI: Yeah.


JACK: It knew long before that, right?


KEITH: Yeah.


JACK: Yeah.


KEITH: And, the fool that you are, declined to make material reward, and instead opted for a toothless apology.


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


JACK: Which was very nearly a toothful retribution!


[KEITH Laughs]


JACK: Um.. okay, so...What do we… Hm… I’m trying— I’m trying [Laughing] to think. What is the next onion layer of this fiasco that we need to peel away?


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH: I mean you could still— so you still have, um… You can still try to get that other lion.


JACK: [Takes A Breath] I don’t think — I don’t know that— I was never on Team Steal-The-Lion. I was on Team Engineer-The-Lion-To-Come-Here.


KEITH: Well, you know. Whatever. You can do more intern stuff.


JACK: Yeah I’m gonna see Never.


JANINE: Mhm?


JACK: And I’m gonna frame this scene and have someone pick for me. We have just delivered a press conference in the Peacock Park. Where I...y’know, stood in the wings while never talked about the exciting— I mean, let’s just zoom in there right? This is the press conference [KEITH: The press conference?] following the lion attack.


KEITH: The prevented lion attack.


JANINE: Okay.


JACK Yes. I think you’re giving this Never. ‘Cause I don’t wanna go up there and be like “It’s me Francoise!”


JANINE: [Laughs] Although we could retroactively say you were wearing one of those clay face kits, with the chin-bit and the nose-bit and whatever, but it’s whatever.


KEITH Groucho Max— Groucho Marx sunglasses? Or glasses?


JANINE:That’s a little too obvious.


[KEITH And JANINE Laugh]


KEITH: People don’t know Canadians in Bluff City!


JANINE: It was a plan executed to perfection— I don’t think it can involve Groucho Marx glasses.


KEITHL Uh it was a stupid plan executed to perfection [Laughs]


JANINE: Yeah, that’s fair. That’s fair. Um…


[0:30:15]


KEITH: But yeah. We can have him wearing clay, like one of those weird acts. In the last bit of uh...


JANINE: Yeah.


KEITH: No, this is— Don— I’m not— nevermind. I was gonna reference something and then decided that it’s not worth it.


JANINE: So um… I think at this point, Never has cut and y’know, put together the video of the incident. And she put like, probably— I imagined her during that scene like, with her phone out. Like, probably searching for like, Audio Network songs that sound like Lion King songs.


[JACK And ALI Laugh]


JANINE: To put over it, and only half-paying attention while she’s holding her camera up. Um… So I imagine that’s the kind of video that came out of it. It’s just like, most of the actual noise from the scene is muddled and confusing. But it’s just blasting this inspirational music and…


JACK It’s a song called “The Sound of the Wild.” [Laughs]


JANINE: [Laughs] Yes. Yeah. Um… and she’s holding this press conference to discuss, “Oh, look at this thing!”


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): It could have been really bad, but our trained professionals— we have the best people in the business working for us. And even when it appears there is danger, there is no actual danger. Because our staff are trained to de-escalate any possible hostile situation. Y’know, a wild animal is still a wild animal. But when you have the right people working with them, you can really accomplish anything.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Quietly] Never?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley) Yes?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Um… Can we wrap this up soon? There’s something I need to address.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Uh, sure. Are there any questions?


KEITH (as Reporter): Yeah... Um, where did the second lion come from?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): It was a new acquisition. Um, one that is still undergoing a lot of training so still getting used to the new environment. We didn’t want to debut them yet, we wanted to make and affair of their debut next week. Um, [Lighthearted] but you know, people who attended got a little sneak preview of what we got in store, at the Bluff City Zoo for everyone.


[Silence]


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Hey are we— are we good? Can we— 


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley) Uh, yeah, we’re good. We’re y’know the uh—  Groundskeeper’s gonna hand out some cafe vouchers that— [Changing To A Conversational Voice] and so,


[ALI Starts To Talk With A Higher-Pitched Voice]


        JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley) What’s up?


ALI (with a higher-pitched voice) Hi, it’s Sarah from Bluff City Middle School. Um, what’s your favorite animal in the zoo?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley) Um… my favorite animal?


KEITH (as Reporter): [Shouting From A Distance] Yeah, what’s your favorite animal in the zoo!?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): My favorite animals are the sneezing monkeys.


[JACK Laughs]


JANINE  (as Never Waston-Wiley): Which are recently discovered. They’re one of the peak attendance draws to the zoo. You should actually check them out— there is a seperate—


ALI (as Sarah): Why do they sneeze?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Patient] Because their noses are upturned in a way that collects rainwater, and after it rains they hafta sneeze it off.


ALI (as Sarah): Why don’t you get them hats?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Because monkeys don’t like wearing hats. They don’t really understand that a hat can frame your features in a very flattering way. Or can provide other functions outside of fashion. But mostly fashion, they don’t understand fashion.


ALI: I’m writing all of this down in a notepad. [Laughs]


        KEITH (as Reporter): Hey, this is Richard from Bluff City Bimonthly-Weekly.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Stifling Irritation] Yes?


KEITH (as Richard): I ain’t never heard of a sneezing monkey!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Sighs] That’s because they’re new. They discovered them like— they discovered them in like, 2010. They announced the discovery in 2011. We’re very lucky to have sneezing monkeys here, we’re one of the few zoos who have them. They’re also known as snub-nosed monkeys. Um, you can find out more in the Snub-Nosed Monkey Pavilion.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Quietly] Are...are we good here? Never?


JANINE: I think Never just leaves the stage— [Laughs]


JACK: [Laughs] Just walks off?


JANINE: The whatever— not the stage. The like, place. Like “Okay we’re done. Yeah.”


KEITH: Pavilion.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Okay, remember when I arrived? And— and you let me trumpet that big project to, y’know— make that lion sale to Trenton Zoo?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Mhm?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): And remember how proud I was of it?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley) Mhm?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Well, it’s a tragedy.


[ALI Chuckles]


JANINE (as Never Watson Wiley): [Confused] I don’t think so ‘cause they gave us full price.
        
JACK (as Boots Bonus): I’m sure they did! That probably makes it worse, if I’m honest. Never?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley) Mhm?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): I googled lions the other day, right? For the first time, probably.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley) Mhm?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): I never Googled them before, I sorta thought about a lion abstractly.


JANINE (as Never Watson Wiley): Mhm?


JACK (as Boots Bonus) But they pair for life, Never. And we got that lion’s wife sent to Trenton! That was me! I did that! And it’s been weighing on— and maybe that’s what today was about, really. You saw how it looked at me! Did you see how it looked at me?


[ALI Laughs]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Um, no...I— it just looked like a lion to me. [Skeptical] Are you sure this is a thing?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Oh yeah, definitely.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): ‘Cause like, you see like, nature documentaries and stuff where like, an old lion gets really shitty. And then a new hot young lion comes up and like, kicks him out? And then the lady lions seem okay with that.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): N— no...This lion has been disappointed. That’s clear. That much is clear.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): I… [Concerned] Boots, are you maybe projecting onto the lion because you feel guilty?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Well of course I feel guilty, we— y’know! We separated them! I separated them! And Dax also got involved.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Mhm?


JACK (as Botos Bonus): Can we get it back?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Um, I mean, we don’t have the money to buy it back, really.


JACK (as Boots Bonus) Well, can we just say “no deal! No deal! The lion comes back!”?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Well, it’s been awhile hasn’t it? I don’t think — there was a contract of sale, but I don’t think there’s anything in it about like... Uh… Like, like, the “Lion Marriage Sanctity”— I don’t think that was— I’ll have a lawyer take another look?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): I don’t know if I can continue to intern here, Never.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Cross] Why is that—?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Cross] If I know that the separation of those lions is on my conscience.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Okay, um...


JACK (as Boots Bonus) And we can’t sell the other lion, ‘cause then we’ve got no lions anymore.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): That’s true...


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Except the Mexican— the New Mexican ones. And y’know... You know….


[Pause]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): They’re fake.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Well, I… I didn’t say that.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Well, but they— You know— a lion isn’t a leopard, and a leopard isn’t a lion.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): You know!?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Look [Takes A Breath] It’s uh… You’ve gotta do a lot of things to preserve the zoo and to, uh…. Make it in the contemporary zoo economy. And, uh...sometimes it’s—  you just look the other way and, uh… You know, there’s no such thing as a black lion. [Unsure] I don’t think? I don’t think there is. I’ve heard of white lions.  Um…


JACK: Boots has just gone white.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): My faith in the sanctity of the zoo has been shattered twice today!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Well it’s, you know… [Exhales] It’s not uh— it’s a zoo, not a church.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): But maybe it should be?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): No. it should absolutely not. [Cross] It absolutely—


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Cross] Maybe we have a responsibility—


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley) What!? [Cross] To be a church!?


JACK (as Boots Bonus) [Cross ]Maybe—


[KEITH Laughs]


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Lots of things can be churches! I’ve been thinking a lot, I nearly was killed by a lion today. I’m doing a lot of thinking.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): You weren’t, it was fine! [Concerned] Do you want a couple days off? I can get you cafe voucher!


JACK (as Boots Bonus): I’m a bit worried about the health status of the cafe, if I’m honest.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): It’s fiine. Everything just comes out of a box, it’s okay. Umm… I think you need some matcha. I think we can get you some matcha and matcha’s very healthful. [Grasping At Straws] It’s very good for health, and um...Guilt reduction! And…


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Takes A Breath] Okay.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): I think if we get you some of that—  We also have been working at—  On uh—  Well on by “working” I mean shipping in— little macarons with like, tiger stripes. They’re very fun.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Takes A Breath] I’ll take some. I’ll take some of those.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Yeah. Make you feel better.


JACK: What kind of a dice am I getting?


JANINE: You get to pick that. [Laughs]


JACK: No, I framed the scene.


KEITH: No, yeah.


JANINE: Oh, I thought— okay.


KEITH: Sorry, I didn’t realize nobody gave you a die. I think that was… a White?


JACK: Yeah. I feel like boots is having a real crisis of zoo-faith, [JANINE Chuckles] but I feel like Never has been kind of like… I mean, is it White though? Is the thing. Has this— I don’t feel like this conversation has actually… I mean you’re assigning it to me, but I don’t know whether or not this conversation has instilled Boots with confidence.


JANINE: I mean, it’s one of those things that, if the die you get feels wrong, then we just do the scene a little more until it feels right. Until we figure out…


JACK: Right. Yeah, totally.


KEITH: Yeah, it feels to me like you’re calling yourself to action. Which I would put as a White. And if you want to do the scene a little bit more to make it feel like that, then yeah.


ALI: Yeah. Um, can I interject with an idea? Or should I just—


JACK: No, good ahead.


ALI: [Laughs] ‘Cause I feel like, now that you’ve confessed to yourself, maybe you can try to get Never to leverage the new press to get the lions back or like, try to get closer to your goal, or you know…


JACK: Right. Yeah. Yeah, that tracks with a White. Um okay…


        JACK (as Boots Bonus): Look: Never, people like what happened today, right?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Quite a lot, yeah.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): And they like that because of the lions?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Um…… [ALi Laughs] [Uncertain] Yes? Mostly yes. Honestly, I think it would’ve worked with a leopard. People like big cats, they don’t really care about the specifics.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Okay. I know what I need to do.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Cross] That’s good!


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Cross] I’m going to leak to the press—


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley) [Quiet] Okay…


JACK (as Boots Bonus): That the lions were separated.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Confused] Why?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Because there will be a great upswell of public support, and they’ll put pressure on people like you to get the lion back!


        JANINE (as Never Watson Wiley): Um...Okay— I don’t love pressure.


[ALI JACK And Keith Laugh Hard]


        JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Pressure doesn’t buy lions [JANINE Laughs]


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Right. Yeah, but y’know… Enough people will be… Y’know you’ve got eyes on you now! Ms. Watson-Wiley. Don’t you think it’s an opportunity to do something good with that? To do something right?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Hm….. Okay, what if… If you can—  y’know—  make a petition or one of those things? Then I can—


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Eager] I’ll make a petition! I’ll do it!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Mhm. If you’ll do that, just kind of like, direct most of your ire and stuff at the Trenton Zoo. And make it seem like they shouldn’t have bought the lion.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Well, but we were the ones who sold it to them.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Yes, but we’re in a position of duress. Do you unders— do you know what I mean?


[ALI Laughs]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): It’s uh… We are in a position where we hafta do things that are maybe not ideal because we hafta feed the other animals and continue providing a certain standard of care for them, because we don’t wanna be one of those back-alley zoos that just puts everyone in a box. Takes two bits a gander from the locals.


[KEITH Laughs Hard Away From Mic]


JACK (as Boots Bonus): We’re gonna put the— [JACK Laughs] We’re gonna put the screws on Trenton?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Put the screws on Trenton. If you get Trenton to cave to social media pressure— even if they just wanna, y’know air-quotes, “loan” the lion back to us temporarily— that’s still a foot in the door, isn’t it?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): That is still a foot in the door.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): It’s still a foot… [Trails Off]


JACK: Okay so I think we’ve updated the plan to blackmail Trenton [Laughing] and that’s definitely a White dice.


[ALI And JANINE Laugh]


JACK: Uh, so now it’s Janine.


KEITH: Yeah.


JANINE: [Takes A Breath] Okay. Um… I think, uh… Hmmm… This is— I think this is an angle that Never— I wanna carry this on because I think this is an angle that Never hadn’t considered, in terms of PR. She’s mostly been focused on how to inflate the Bluff City Zoo’s profile. She has not considered deflating another zoo’s profile.


[ALI And Keith Laugh Hard]


JANINE: Um— [Janine and Jack laugh]


JACK: This is the, uh— Oh! I know what this is. This is that RollerCoaster Tycoon thing that you posted in the Bluff City chat right?


[ALI And JANINE Laugh Hard]


JANINE Yes!


JACK: Which I will just...


JANINE: If everyone dies in the other park it’s fine! [Laughs]


JACK: I will just find now um…. Was this before or after the Male Chef Thanksgiving, Janine? [Cross] Oh I found it


JANINE: [Cross] This was before. Yeah.


JACK: “While playing Rollercoaster Tycoon one time, I remember that I was tasked with getting a higher approval rating than the park next door. Rather than making my park better I instead built a roller coaster that launched people at 100mph into my rival’s park. Since technically those people died in my rival’s park, their approval rating would plummet and people would rush to my park in straight onto my death-coaster, which only cause their rating to drop lower and lower. I did this for an hour until the game said I’d won.”


[JACK  And JANINE Laugh]


JACK: So uh, Never’s now just like [Considering] “Huh. Trenton.”


JANINE: Mhm! Mhm!


KEITH: “What if we kill people in their park!?”


[ALI JACK KEITH Laugh Hard]


JANINE: Okay well not that. I think the extrapolation that I’m gonna make of that rollercoaster plan is that uh… I think Never uh… I think that uh… Okay. So, these macarons that they’re getting shipped in I imagined are specifically targeted towards zoos. So I imagine every fucking zoo is gonna have these tigerstripe macarons, if they can just buy them and stock them. Because it’s an easy sell. People love macarons. They love tigers. Boom. Done.


KEITH: Yeah I’ve never been to a zoo that didn’t have macarons. [Chuckles]


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


JANINE: You can sell each one for two bucks a cookie, it’s uhh— [Laughs] It’s a whole thing. So I imagine that Never gets this idea, that she is going to covertly, um… go to the Trenton Zoo. With like, a sort of— a platter. Like a sample platter? Of macarons, but they’re old. Like she’s left them out on a counter for a while, like in the back. She probably left them on the fridge. On top of the fridge for a while, so they got like, warm and like, stale, and kind of like, uh… You know when baked goods get like— not moist— but wet?


JACK: Oh!


KEITH: Yeah.


JANINE: I don’t know if macarons can do that, but [JACK: I hate it] these ones do. They do do it. Maybe she like, sprayed them with a water bottle or something to get that texture. ‘Cause they still look— I mean, they look bad. But! They’re free and they’re on a little plate that says “Free Samples” And I think Never Watson-Wiley like, drives out to the Trenton Zoo and then. And hmm... Who would she trust this to...?


[Long Silence]


[ALI Laughs]


JANINE: No one here.


[ALI Laughs Hard]


JANINE: I thinks she gets someone on a fiver or something?


[Everyone Laughs Hard]


ALI: Dax and Darren are not a— [Laughs]


KEITH: Oh I know how to get any cookie anywhere.


ALI: Yeah. You need us to put cookies somewhere?


JANINE: I think actually okay, here’s what happens. I think she hires someone to set the cookies up. To like, leave them somewhere it looks kind of official, like “Free Samples of Our New Tiger Macarons! Yum-Yum!”


JACK: [Cross] [Laugh] That’s not a suspicious card, is it?


KEITH: [Cross] Outside help sounds like a loose end.


JANINE: [Laughs] Then I think she sends… Dax to— well actually, Dax would, hm… Okay, so she gives Dax— she takes Dax’s phone [Laughs] at some point and like, 


        KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Hey!


JANINE: Plugs in one of her fake social media accounts that she Likes stuff with.


[ALI Laughs]


JANINE: And then sends Dax to go to Trenton Zoo, and take pictures of their macarons and do like “#TrentonZoo #TigerMacaronDay #Questionable” whatever, and like, post a bunch of pictures of these gross-looking macarons. And then I think she gives Darren another social media account. Like another fake social media account. And has him post pictures of the good macarons at Bluff City Zoo to be like,


JACK: That’s like, a very benign— 


[JACK, JANINE, And KEITH Laugh]


JANINE: “@zoogoer28 Look at these ones! They’re way better!”


[ALI And Jack Laugh]


JACK: You know what’s real good at that zoo full of exotic animals? I love that sort of crunch cake they have.


[ALI, JANINE, And JACK Laugh]


ALI: [laughing] It's like -- it's like the -- you know I had to do it to em pose, but it’s just Darren in the like, Peacock Park, standing in front of the beautiful view. The lake. The peacocks. And it’s gorgeous. And he’s just like, standing there, with two peacocks— er macarons, and like a smile on his face. And is like— the tweet is, all lower caps— lower-case that says “yo come through…...macaroons” And then it’s like a bunch of candy emoji [Laughs] and then a tiger emoji.


JANINE: Perfect.


JACK: Oh my god. Incredible.


KEITH: What kind of dice are— is this? [Stifles Laughter]


ALI: I think this is a White dice [Beneath Laughter] I think this is going perfectly.


KEITH: You think this works?


ALI: How could this go wrong?


KEITH: Could get caught by [ALI Laughs] Trenton Zoo management.


JACK: I’m like, hesitant to put Trenton on screen. Like directly? LIke I— there’s something nice about like, we just hear about people driving out there and leaving [Laughs] macarons!


[ALI Laughs]


JANINE: Just see a twent— [Laughs] a twent!? A tweet that has a Trenton like, as the like, geotag thing on it or whatever. It’s like, “Well. Says Trenton right there!”


JACK: Maybe you get a call from someone in Trenton. Like your phone rings and they’re like,


JACK (as Caller): “Is this um. Ms. Watson-Wiley?”


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Yes, how can I help you?


JACK (as Caller): I’ve been hearing about your macarons.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Coy] They’re very good. Very fresh.


JACK (as Caller): Yes. A new addition.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Mhm?


JACK (as Caller): Hm.... Interesting. Well… It’s been good to call. [Pause] I’m a little disappointed by these measures, Ms. Watson-Wiley.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Do you not like macarons?


JACK (as Caller): I’m disappointed— 


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): If you have a food allergy we’re able to accomodate, um— Not all food allergies, because there’s almond flour in macarons, but um… Certain food allergies we can certainly.


JACK (as Caller): I’ve not tried them. I just think it’s striking. Don’t you think it’s striking? One plate of macarons? One plate of macarons in Bluff City? One plate if macarons in Trenton? What do you suppose the difference can be?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Oh we don’t keep our macarons on plates. We keep them in a display case—


JACK (as Caller): [Offended And Incredulous Laughter] Oh, I’m sure you do!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): So that people can choose the one that they would like to purchase.


JACK (as Caller): I’m sure you do.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): We do gift boxes for friends.


JACK (as Caller): What’s this about?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): You called me.


JACK (as Caller): Yes.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): I would say it’s about macarons [Laughs]


JACK (as Caller): [Inhales Deeply] Well. Always nice to check in with a smaller zoo. Hope you have a good rest of your day. Hope you make many good macaron sales.


Never: [Tentative] Thanks.


JACK: And there’s just like, a  moment of silence on the phone. And then [Laughs] and then it hangs up. I think this is still White right? ‘Cause what we wanted was to antagonize Trenton?


JANINE: Mhm.


JACK: And Trenton was like “Yeah, okay.”


JANINE: Also it doesn’t matter what Trenton thinks.


JACK: Sure, absolutely. Well, we kind of want them—


KEITH: The only thing that matters is the sosh[4].


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: We want the sosh, and we also want the lion.


JANINE: Mhm.


ALI: We do.


JANINE: But the sosh is how we get to the lion.


ALI: Yeah.


JANINE: First you get the sosh.


[ALI Laughs Hard]


JACK: [Cross] Then you get the lion, twice.


JANINE: [Cross] Then you get the cookies. Then you get the lio— [Laughs]


[JACK Laughs]


ALI: [Yawns] Okay! Keith.


KEITH: Um… Okay, I’m doing a scene with— is this…? There’s still one more round after this right?


JACK: Yeah.


KEITH: I’m doing a scene, it’s me and Darren.


ALI: Mhm?


KEITH: I’m a hero now, and… So I’m gonna set up my exhibit. Aaaand—


[ALI JACK And JANINE Laugh]


KEITH: [Chuckling] I think that Never Watson-Wiley finds us building the new Dax Leopard Exhibit. And we’re— I guess we’re hammering something?


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH: Like, I don’t know if it’s totally clear if it’s effective…? Yeah! I’m sure that we at least get a square of wood that we hammered into place or something.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Do we need glass for this? Should I put holes— do we need glass? Or like, what sort of…? For the enclosure? What sort of uh… I guess I’m not dangerous right? So I guess it can be more like a peacock-thing. We could just build a low wall and I can be inside of it.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): You— You’re not dangerous.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): No, I’m not dangerous.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): You want people walking up to you though? ‘Cause glass is like, exclusive.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): I don’t want them getting in my face, but like, a little wall will do it right? Do you think some punk kid will mess with me?


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Ohhh, you should do what we—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): ‘Cause I’ll take him out— Oh I guess I am dangerous.


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Shit.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yo, can you swim?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah! Heck yeah I can swim. Fucking, hell-yes, I can swim!!


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): [Ali Laughing] Of course you can swim bro. Of course you can swim! We can do like, one of those half-walls—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Junior Varsity diving team, bro! Didja know that about me?


[ALI Laughs Excitedly]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Incredulous] I’m….I’m sorry, are you building yourself an enclosure?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard) Yeah, I figured that we put out the hero video, I saved that Canadian dude. Um, and so people are gonna want to come to the zoo and see me. And so I’m setting myself up a little exhibit.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeah, the animal trainer.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Animal trainer exhibit.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeah, look at him!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Dax leopard, the hero cat-wrangler.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright. I need to talk to the administrator about this, but— just out of curiosity— what kind of food would you like? Would you like raw fish? Would you like raw beef? Um...would you like, uh… Y’know. Some pumpkins? Some various fruits and vegetables?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Fruits is good. The raw stuff I’m a little iffy on, unless you give me like, what I need to do to make a fire. Um…


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Do you give the big cats what they need to make a fire to cook their dinners?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): No, they don’t have opposable thumbs, they don’t need to— Also raw food is totally fine for them!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Maybe it’s fine for you too! [Cross] If you’re living in the zoo—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Cross] You know anything about animals excuse me, though?


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yo, Dax you’re getting a little heated, just calm down. [Cross] Not everyone knows animals like you do.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Cross] Sorry, sorry, I’m just getting pumped for the exhibit, yeah.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): You know, I… Maybe I don’t know a lot about animals— I do know a lot about zoos, and what goes in them.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Like animal trainers— he’s gonna take the shrimp, by the way.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah animal trainers in any zoo— wait, I’m gonna take what?


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): The shrimp!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Raw shrimp?


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): It’s cocktail shrimp, bro.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Oh! I’ll have— yeah, I’ll have shrimp, then.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeah, fruit and shrimp.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Cross] I’ll get two orders of the fruit—


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Cross] You’re gonna eat a bucket of shrimp everyday, and nothing else?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): A whole bucket—? No, I’ll have like a— 


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): One bucket of shrimp and a half-bucket of fruit.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeah.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): OR! No, I’ll take a whole bucket of fruit— stay healthy. Half-bucket of shrimp.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Okaay...


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Good call, bro.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Thanks.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): There’s also the matter that we do not provide uniforms for animals, um, in the exhibits. So you’re gonna hafta provide your own uniform.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): I figured I’d just whip out what I got in my closet and show off the different— like the different styles of Dax.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Uh-huh...


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): What if we like, bedazzle the— his uniform vest? So people would know he’s an exhibit and not am employee.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Oh, it’ll catch people’s eyes!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Sarcastic] Right, like all the other exhibits we’ve bedazzled in the past.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Right!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah. Like all the exhibits we’ve bedazzled.


[ALI Laughs]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): We’ve been bedazzling these exhibits.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): For years!


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): How do you— what did you think gets people here? The dazzle


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah. Why do you think the lynx is so popular? It’s the smallest big cat! It’s just— 


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): What!?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): It’s ‘cause it’s covered in sequins!


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeah, we put glitter on it.


[JACK Laughs]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Concerned] I don’t think that’s safe.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): [Nonchalant] Eh, it’s fine.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Ask the two totally-alive lynxes if it’s safe.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): [Chuckles Confidently]


[KEITH Laughs]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Well I can’t ask because they’re animals. That live in the zoo.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Groans Loudly] Then look at the two totally-living lynxes, that it’s safe!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Um….


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Quiet] Starting to become very frustrating to me… I am… [Louder] Like a famous hero!!! Why do you not want this!?


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): He’s been in the newspaper twice!


[1:00:00]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): I’ve been in the newspaper two times now! That’s more than you!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Technically you’ve only been in one and a half, because you were sharing that one article with me. And actually I would say you’ve been in it in total of one time because this instance was also shared with Francoise— whoever the hell that name was.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Under Breath] God… Just like… Am like… [Normal Voice] Being so chafed by your jealousy here.


[ALI JACK And JANINE Laugh]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): I’m being so chafed by this! It’s been so long!


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Don’t chafe my dude!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Don’t chafe me, dude!


[KEITH Laughs Hard Away From Mic]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Oh boy! I am being so chafed by this jealousy!!


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeah, yeah. Take a walk, take a walk. Just take a walk.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Takes Deep Breaths] [Away From Mic] Yeah…


[ALI And JACK Laugh Hard]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Far From Mic] [Repeatedly Sneezes Loudly]


[ALI JACK And JANINE Laugh Hard]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Okay— 


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): [Cross] You can’t rile him up, he’s an exhibit now!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Shouting Away From Mic] [Cross] This happens to me every time!! [Normal Voice] I have never met anyone that has made me sneeze like you do.


[Everyone Laughs]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): That’s what my ex-husband said. Anyway, here’s my real problem with this: People are gonna come to the zoo and they are gonna want to see you, Dax. [Reassuring] They are gonna want to see you. They’re gonna want to see you in action, though. And if you’re in an enclosure, all to yourself, they’re not gonna see that. They’re gonna see you reading... Men’s Fitness or whatever it is that you read. [ALI Laughs] They’re not gonna see you in your element.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Put a… Put like a, um… Put like, a cat in here with me!


[ALI And Jack Laugh]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeeeeaaah!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): And then it’s like, “The lion tram— lion trainer in his natural environment”


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Oh, that’s perfect!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): What’s the—


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): The lion already has his habitat, so why don’t you just go there?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): But that’s the lion exhibit! And we need, like, a Dax exhibit, featuring, like a serval.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): A what?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): A serval.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Oh, like a cat. Like the little— right.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah. Or like a car— a caracal!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Well then why don’t you go into that enclosure?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): That’s the—


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): [Excited] Let’s build a stage!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Exasperated] That’s the—


[Jack Laughs]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Let’s build a stage for Dax! And we’ll bring the animals here!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah, whatever gets me like… I’m ready for the spotlight, is what I’m saying! I’m ready for it! I feel like I’ve been on the bench! In the background! I’m ready! For the spotlight! I’m doing it! I am unchafable!!!


[JACK And JANINE Laugh]


JACK: [Matter-Of-Factly] So this is a Black die?


[Everyone Laughs]


JACK: It’s very Fiasco to have a character basically be like “I feel amazing and everything’s going to go great” and that being a negative response. So this is a Black die for you Keith.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Listen: that’s fine. Put— all I’m saying… [Spiteful] Ms. Never Ever Watson-Wiles. [Pleading] Put this zoo on the map! Human exhibit. Hero exhib— I am a hero! I’m waiting on my half-a-million, too, by the way. From that video—


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): We don’t make money on those— even a little bit.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): What!?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Uh-huh.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): No, I— We did that for half-a-mil each.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Who told you that?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): It’s just— the math that me and Darren came up with.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeah!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Me and D did that math!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): I don’t go to you guys for math. I don’t know many people who do.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Well, we know math, and we know we’re owed a million dollars, so build a million dollar stage—


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Okay. Alright, alright.


[ALI JACK And KEITH Laugh]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): You give me your— you show me your work, as the teachers would say. “Show me your work on that one.” if you can have that on my desk. A detailed invoice, particularly with— 


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): We set up a whole attack for you!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): I want you to break that down for me. And we’ll pay you a salary.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): [Skeptical and Accusatory] That video didn’t give you a million dollars?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): That I believe— your salary, a bonus—- actually we don’t talk about a bonus at all. You can talk to the uh… The manager, and the payroll about, perhaps, a bonus. It’s not exactly legal for people to live on the zoo grounds.


[Jack Laughs]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): I’ll go home at night— I’m not gonna… I mean, I guess I’ll sleep over sometimes.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Alright then why don’t we put out a chair for you in that case?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): As long as you build a wall around— listen: First human exhibit! Hero exhibit. Is this not ringing any bells for you?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): What if we give you the chair we give Safari Santa for Christmas?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Receptive] That’s a big chair.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Yeah!


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Oh, that’s like a throne, bro!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah, that’s like a throne.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Concurring] It’s a big comfy chair.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): And you said I can have Men’s Fitness in there?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Yeah, yeah. And there’s also have a catheter set up there, if that’s what— but we don’t have to, that’s—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): No, I don’t want that. I’ll just leave. Install a door. I mean, we’ll finish this—


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Well we wanted discourage use of bottles, that’s all. It’s fine if you want to—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): No I was gonna use the restroom.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Mhm. That’s fine too.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): People don’t like seeing— well it’s fine for you. I was gonna say people don’t like seeing Santa use the restroom, but you’re just Dax, so it’s fine.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah I’m— [Offended] Just Dax. Oh you are so lucky that I am unchafable right now.


[ALI And JACK Laugh Hard]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): If any of the children ask why the hero is in the bathroom, we’ll say that even heroes poop!


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Everyone poops.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): It’ll be fine. Mhm.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Give me the throne. I’ll finish my enclosure. I’ll make a sign.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Quiet And Exasperated] Still want the enclosure. Okay.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah, where else are we gonna put the throne? A hero who sits in a chair!? That’s not— I’m a star attraction now!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Are you saying you’re better than Santa?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yes!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Because Santa just sits in a chair and people approach him.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): It’s a different experience!


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeah, don’t be better than Santa.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah you’re right, I’m sorry.


JACK: [Laughs] Let’s respect Santa in this zoo.


[Everyone Laughs]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Laughing] Safari Santa is an important tradition in Bluff City, okay?


JACK: Oh god. Safari Santa is great! So is this still a Black die?


ALI: [Laughs] I think— [Laughs]


KEITH: Yeah, sure. Yeah.


JANINE: I think so.


KEITH: Right? It’s a stupid thing that I’m doing, right? It’s not— 


JACK: Yeaaah.


JANINE: Also, you’ve been downgraded to like, a Santa chair.


ALI: Yeah, you’re not getting away with the corners you cut.


JACK: As opposed to hero exhibit [Laughs] Which I don’t think is a thing in a zoo! [Laughs]


KEITH: No it’s the first one ever! [Using Dax’s Voice] And it’s gonna crush! It’s going to crush!


JACK: [Laughs] Okay… Right well. There’s your Black die.


[ALI Laughs Hard]


JACK: So—-


ALI: Okay.


JANINE: Perfect.


JACK: So, we have one more round and then— and an ending. And I’m just kinda— I’m just curious about timing, right now. Because it’s getting pretty late, and I’m trying to balance out the thing of like— it would be good to get this done in one go. But also it’s 3:42 in the morning.


ALI [Surprised] Oh!


JANINE: Hmmm.


ALI: Well. [Chuckles]


JACK: [Laughs] And I don’t know to what extent it can be good. And I’m happy to keep going a bit longer, but I’m also curious to hear other people’s thoughts here.


ALI: [Takes A Breath] Ummm.. [Uncertain] I feel like we’re capable of wrapping this up?


JANINE: Yeah.


KEITH: Yeah, I feel like if any round is gonna be the fastest round, I think it would be the last round.


JANINE: I’m content to be brisk with this, ‘cause I feel like we’ve hit a lot of the… 


KEITH: Yeah


JANINE: I mean, we’ve kinda even done “the wrong guy gets busted,” because we fucked up Trenton’s scene.


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: Oh I mean, yeah, we should probably— 


JANINE: Hypothetically.


JACK: [Laughs] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay, I’m happy— I’m happy to keep going. I just wanted to flag out the time.


JANINE: Mhm.


ALI: Okay, yeah.


JACK: Before we went to 4.


ALI: Yeah, would you say an hour? Or less?


JACK: Um….


JANINE: Tighter than that, right?


JACK Tighter than that.


ALI: Okay.


JACK: Because that would be 5 in the morning.


ALI: [Laughs] Uh-huh, that’s what that would be.


KEITH: Jack did you just wanna call it? We can do the last round? Or?


JACK Um… How long do we think it will take us to go around?


KEITH: I think that if we didn’t count on um… If we didn’t count on hitting 45 minutes at like— as like, probably likely? Then I don’t think we should do it.


JACK [Takes A Breath] Yeah. Um… Uh..


JANINE: I feel like that’s doable, if people could… Like, be firmer in when a scene ends, I guess?


JACK Yeah. Yeah! Let’s do it! Uh, and if we get to a point where…[Laughs] we can’t. Then we can’t!


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH: Yeah, if we have two scenes or one or two scenes left, we can like, that’s a thing where scheduling almost isn’t a worry, because we hafta have a half-an-hour.


ALI: Yeah.


JACK: Alternatively, um… Yes, let’s, let’s… Let’s go ahead!


KEITH: Yeah, let’s do it.


ALI Okay.


KEITH: Alright. Ali?


ALI: Alright, I know exactly what my scene is gonna be. I’ve been inspired. Guilt is on Darren’s conscience obviously. And I think that he is taking Dax— and also inviting Boots, but Boots can come late— to like, a local sort-of club?


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


ALI: I think there’s like— so we um… I live on Long Island and we have a thing nearby called The Mile, where there’s like, bars that, on Saturdays, you like— they like charge a cover to get in and then like, the drinks are super expensive. But like, you know. Community college kids, people who work in the area still go to that because it’s a club scene in a suburb in Long island [Laughs] And I think it’s kinda a similar thing. Where it’s a restaurant on the boardwalk does the same sort of thing. Moves all the tables and it’s expensive and there’s a lot of guys with [Laughs] frosted tips. And slacks, and Armani belts hanging out. Loud music. And [Laughs] Dax is here, to have a heart-to-heart with his friends— Or Darren is here to have—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): YO THIS IS MY FAVORITE SPOT!!![5]


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeah, I— y’know I brought you here because I knew that you really liked it. Lemme buy you another drink. What’re you drinking buddy?


KEITH: I’m drinking uh…. I’m drinking one of those sparkling waters with Vodka in it. Like the flavored… It’s like lemon.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Lacrox shaker bro, nice. Loving it. Gonna get you another one of those. Uh, the reason [ALI Laughs] I brought you here is because I have a confession to make and I have a favor to ask of you.


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): YEAH, ANYTHING! DO YOU WANT A TENDY? DO YOU WANT A CHICKEN TENDY?


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yes. I would like one of those— but wait! Wait until you’ve heard the news before you offer your chicken. I don’t want you to walk away— y’know maybe after we have this conversation you won’t wanna give me your chicken anymore. I just wanna clear the air. We need to be on the same page— the Bro Page. I— [ALI Laughs]


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): BRO PAGE.


[ALI Laughs Hard]


KEITH: And then we do the Bro Page song that we have.


ALI: Yeah.


[JACK Laughs]


ALI: Yeah, we both close our hands and open them as if we’re opening a book and then we [Cross] separate them and then high five.


Keith [Cross] And then we do the first line of— we do the index finger on the palm— and read,


        KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Oh! Bro page!


[ALI Laughs Hard]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Um… Listen you know that lion that you’ve been really bummed about?


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Yeah, that lion’s like, wicked— 


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): We’re trying to get his wife back.


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Oh, great! That’s awesome ‘cause that lion’s like, sick.


[JACK Laughs]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Oh, you didn’t see the tweets?


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Tweets? No.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeah, there’s this whole petition, we’re trying to get this lion back.


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Oh that’s awesome! ‘Cause like, when... Do you know— Remember that Canadian dude that showed up?


[ALI and JACK Laugh Hard]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeah I do.


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): When the lion saw like— looked in his eyes. Some, like— he’s like, sick now.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Sick how? Like sick-angry? Like  sick, like…


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Like, ill. Like, physically-ill.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Like not eating? Like sick?


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Yeah, like sick. Like sick-sick.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): [Under Breath] Oh my god. Oh my god! This is killin’ me! This is killin’ me! Don’t tell me that lion’s sick! [Normal voice] We took his wife!


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Yeah… Do you think we should give the lion to where his wife is so that they [Darren: No] can be together?


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): No no no. I have an even better idea. And you know what? It’s gonna get you that exhibit. You have a throne now right?


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Yeah.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): [Takes a breath] I think that when you bring the lion back we should do like, a vow renewal.


[JACK Stifles Laughter]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): So I can make amends with this lion.


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Ohhhh.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): I gotta make it right with this lion and I don’t know how. [Cross] I was going to bring him a cake. Boots wouldn’t let me.


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): [Cross] That’s good. No like, lions are like, mad-sentimental. I think that it—


JACK (as Boots Bonus): HI, IT’S PRETTY LOUD IN HERE, ISN’T IT?


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): I think you’d really— YEAH MAN IT’S SICK RIGHT?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Um...what was that about a vow?


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Oh, hey Boots.


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): WE’RE MARRYING— WE’RE GONNA RE-RENEW THE VOWS OF THE LIONS.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): When we get the lion back. This is how we’re gonna make amends.


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): THAT CANADIAN GUY MADE THE LION REAL SICK— I DUNNO, THERE WAS SOMETHING FUCKED-UP IN HIS EYES OR SOMETHIN’.


JACK (as Boots Bonus):: [Dawning Awareness] Make material amends!!


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yo, this is the Canadian.


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): OH, DUDE! THAT WAS YOU? I WAS LIKE, “WHY DIDN’T HE SHOW UP?” ‘CAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR THING.


[JACK and ALI Laugh Hard]


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): But there was some guy named Thomas Francois Bonus.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): That… that was [ALI Laughs Hard] Look: I’m just glad that we’re gonna make the lions be together again. And that there can be some kind of— I mean, mostly for me.


Keith [Quietly] Oh, sorry wrong—[6] 


[JACK And ALI Chuckle]


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Mostly for me, beyond the lions. ‘Cause it’s been weighing on my conscience. It’s really loud here isn’t it?


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): You’re right. This is beyond the lions. This is about all of us!


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Right. Uh, right.


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): You’re the smartest dude that we know!


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yo, what phone you got on you?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): I— it’s—


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Yeah, do you have a 10S?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Confused] Uh, no. Why? Can I go?


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Yeah let’s all go.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): [Disappointed] You don’t wanna hang out?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): I finished my tendies.


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Oh yeah, you can have— there’s one. There’s one tendy and you can have it.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Thank you, man. Thank you.


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): Honey mustard, man.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeah, let’s go plan a lion wedding.


[JANINE Snickers]


JACK: That’s a positive?


KEITH  (as Dax Leopard): I already have notes for that, by the way. Just ‘cause I was just thinking about it one day.


[ALI Snickers]


KEITH: Alright, I think that’s it for the scene. Right? We should— 


ALI: Yeah. [Laughing] We’re good.


JACK: Yeah, I feel like that’s a net positive. That worked out just fantastic, I feel. Um… okay. I would like a scene with… Hm… [Long Pause] I would like a scene with Dax.


KEITH: Yeah. [Using Dax’s Voice] Woah, yeah. Woah.


JACK: And I’m going to frame the scene. So someone else can— y’know… Um…


KEITH: Die you?


JACK: Actually! Y’know what? I’m gonna resolve this scene. Someone else can frame it. It can have Dax in it. It can have anybody in it.


KEITH: Um, I think that you have us meet somewhere quiet. Um… I don’t know— I don’t know what the meeting’s about, but I think that you take us to um...


[JACK Laughs]


KEITH: Maybe like, uh… Maybe like, uh… A cafe bookstore. Like a bor— or a bookstore’s cafe.


JACK: Why are we—


KEITH: I think it’s— what was that?


JACK: Why are we meeting?


KEITH: Um… let’s see… I thin— Oh! I think that we’ve gotta plan the wedding.


JACK: [Laughs] I mean, is it… Okay, sure.


KEITH: Or maybe we got a plan to hide— I don’t know, does anyone have an idea for this meeting? It was Jack’s idea. But he’s un— he’s[7] unallowed to say.


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: [Laughs] I don’t have to be seeing Dax is the thing. We can just frame a completely different scene.


JANINE: It seems like maybe you’ll be trying to close the deal on the whole lion return.


JACK: Yeah, that’s what I was thinking, yeah.


[ALI Clears Her Throat]


JACK: So is Never there as well? Um… Like how am I— how is this closing… In what situation is this closing happening?


JANINE: Oohh, I think— Or maybe like… Maybe like, Boots and Dax are just like, happen to be like, having lunch and like talking about like, this, this whole lion wedding thing. And Never has like… Never finds out that like, the petition pressure worked. 


JACK: Ooohh yeah!


JANINE: And that they’re going to loan the lion back. 


JACK: And comes to the restaurant to the—


JANINE: Yeah and—


JACK: Or to the bookstore cafe


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Never! Hi! Ms. Watson-Wiley. Please sit down, Dax and— 


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): I’m so glad I found you— I’m don’t... wanna sit down, I’m not gonna stay here. So it’s—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Whispering Loudly] It’s so quiet in here!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Whispering] So, good news.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Whispering] What? Yeah, what?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Quietly] The good news is, the Trenton Zoo, um… Sent me a vaguely cryptic but mostly reassuring text message, saying that they were going to loan the uh… Lioness back to us temporarily.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Relieved] Oh, thank god.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Mostly because the internet is very mad at them. And um—


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Okay.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): It’s making them quite uncomfortable.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): No, I’ll take it! I’ll Take it!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Mhm.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Oh my god!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): So we’re looking to have her back. It should be about uh... Well they— there was some bartering about the details, but next Thursday— I think— is uh… The day we’re aiming for.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): So that’s when we can set the date, right Dax?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Right, for the sacrament!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Confused] What?


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Sacrament.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Are we still having a conversation about how the zoo should be a church?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Oh! No, also— I wanted to apologize about that. I was really…


[KEITH Coughs Off-Mic]


JACK (as Boots Bonus): I was really in a place that day.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): That’s fair.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): And I know that was unprofessional, and I hope you won’t— you know. ‘Cause my teachers, they say that I had a tendency to get overinvested in a thing to my detriment. And to its detriment, you know? But I’m really happy we’re gonna have this lion wedding.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah, do you think that actually making the zoo a church would actually be a good idea for the wedding?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): N— [Considering] Hm…. No? No. That’s something we wanted to talk about Never. Dax and I were talking and we were kinda gonna renew the vows of the lions.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Okay. How are you gonna renew a thing that doesn’t exist?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Well, they’re married. They’re married for life.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Unconvinced] Uh-huh?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Obviously they will want to [Cross] reaffirm that vow in the holy sacrament of marriage.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Cross] I thought we talked about this.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Less Convinced] Uh-huh?


KEITH: And then I take out a gold cross and I kiss it.


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Okay, do you know if the male lion is still wearing his wedding ring?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): They don’t have fingers like that.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): They don’t have fingers—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Loud] GOD! Do you not know anything about animals? I feel like every time we talk you have no idea what you’re talking about.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Dax…


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): No, she chafes me! 


[ALI Laughs]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Can you produce the original license? Or perhaps—


JACK (as Boots Bonus): There’s no— 


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): If there was a guestbook.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Never I—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Oh, I have that.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Perhaps the lions’ parents wishing them well.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): I have the original license.[8]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Or if there’s a gift registry.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): There’s no gift registry, they don’t do it like that! I do have the original license though, I do have that.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Okay, can you produce that for me?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Okay, yeah. I mean, I have a copy on me, do you want it?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Yes, that would be... [Cross] confusing and fantastic


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Cross] really? This is kind of surprising to me too


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Yes.


[JACK And JANINE Stifle Laughter]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Why do think— if they weren’t married I wouldn’t have let you talk me into renewing their vows. Or did Darren talk me into that?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): I don’t think it was [Cross] anyone here.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Cross] anyway if they weren’t married we’d do a marriage not a renewal of vows. Here’s the marriage license. It’s not... You know


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Surprised and Impressed] Oh my god!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah.


JANINE: Is it actually— Keith. Is it actually… What is it? [Laughs]


KEITH: It’s a marriage license! It looks official to you! There you go!


JACK: [Laughs] I will rem— [Laughs] I will remind everybody that Dax and Darren’s additional detail is “We Need To Get Away With Cutting Corners”.


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: Says the man who produced a fully laughing authentic lion marriage license. Boots… Boots doesn’t really know how to respond to this. Boots went into this conversation being like, “Never is being condescending towards Dax about our lion wedding,” but also kind of knows that a lion wedding is only really there to salve Boots’ conscience rather than anything else. And now is just kind of blown away, by the arrival of a lion marriage certificate


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Dax why do you have a marriage certificate?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Because I made them get married. Well they wanted it. So I allow— y’know— facilitated it.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): And you didn’t think to mention this when we sold one of them to Trenton?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): It took… Do you not remember how much convincing it took?


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [JACK Laughing] It took quite a lot of convincing, actually, now that I remember it. That was quite a lot of convincing there.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah. It was like “We need the money. We gotta feed the other animals” and I was like “No, you don’t understand. This is really gonna hurt them.”


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Look, Never. We have a wedding certificate. And think about the publicity! This is legit. I mean, y’know. 


[JACK Laughs]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): People do like dog weddings.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): And this is— dogs— Lions are way bigger than dogs.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Yeah.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): You could put more clothes on them, there’s more surface area, that’s just math.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): I would not recommend putting clothes on the lions.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Do you want a wedding Dax!?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Look, if you wanna put clothes on them, put clothes on them.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): That’s not my job. It’s the hero’s job.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): I’m not putting clothes on these lions. I just won’t do it.


JACK: And then just like—  [Laughs]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): What about a veil? A veil on top?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): I mean, here’s the thing: I can do it— 


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): A veil, and one of those fake shirt fronts that you tuck into your pants.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): No. No ‘cause at that point it’s just tawdry.


[JACK And JANINE Laugh]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): I can do a veil and a bowtie.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): I’ll settle fo— yes. We just need people to know it’s a wedding, not christening or anything.


JACK: Okay [Laughs] this is a hard succe—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Do you not know about christenings either? God…


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Annoyed] I know what a christening is, I’m just—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Incredulous And Dejected] How did you even get in that newspaper article?[9]


JACK: [Laughs] Um yeah, that’s a white dice! I get to resolve that. That’s a White dice. And uh… that went really well! I didn’t think that we had a wedding certificate for these lions.


[ALI And JANINE Laugh]


KEITH: Wow, I can’t believe there’s only Black dice left, that sucks.


JANINE: Yeah. it’s not good for me and Keith. That’s quite bad in fact.


[JACK Laughs]


[ALI Catches Her Breath]


JANINE: So I guess it doesnt’ even matter if I establish a scene versus—


KEITH: No, it doesn’t matter.


JANINE: Resolving a scene. Um… So I think the scene I’m going to do is… Uh… Hm… I think Never um… Hm...  I think Never asks Darren to come to the peacock supply building/office where she does her like, sit-down work. Because she has to draft up this sort-of semi-public wedding invitation. Um… for these lions, uh… I mean, I think she just wants another set of eyes on it, but also Dax has been quite aggro lately, so—


[ALI Laughs, Janine Chuckles]


JANINE: So Darren, as somebody who is close to the topic but also sufficiently removed, I think she would think is a better design resource. Uh…


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): So uh, I was thinking of using— since we’re posting it socially and not actually sending out wedding invitations because we can’t send them to the entire town because we have very little money still. This has not resolved our money issues at all — and I don’t know how we’re gonna feed this lion— we’ll make it work, because we believe in animal care. Greatly. But, were just gonna post these invitations on Twitter so we’re not gonna do any foil or any like, textured paper.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Make one of those gifs. You want me to Blingee it? [Laughs] It’ll be great! I can put a cross that’s like dazzling. I can put a guy dancing. We could flames all over it! It’ll be sick!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Uh-huh? This is getting increasingly blasphemous in a way that I wasn’t expecting.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yo, Flames of Love!


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Okay? Is that a song you like? Is that a thing?


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): No it’s the passion of love between two lions, what’re you talking about?


[ALI, JACK, And KEITH Laugh Hard]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): [Laughing] You ever made an invitation before?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Um…


[JACK Laughs]


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Yes?


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): [Sincere] Okay, I was out of line. I’m sorry. That was out of line. I’m just saying. It’s the passion of love between two lions.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Okay, I asked you— I was mostly just wanted your opinion on if you thought the white was too much, if you think I should do an offwhite ‘cause it’s a renewal and not a lion wedding.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Ohh. Kind of a Miss Manners thing. Uh...


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Yeah.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Well the lion has been a bride before. So maybe the offwhite.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Yeah, that’s why I was thinking the offwhite. Um… Do they have any— do we know if they have any family?


[JACK Laughs, KEITH Laughs Hard]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): [Takes A Breath, Exhales Deeply] [Lighthearted] Okay, this is where it gets a bit complicated. Okay. So, you know there’s the lions? They were married. They’ve kinda like a… I think— you know the leopard, with the like, clipped ear?


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Yeah.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Yeah. He— I think that he— they haven’t had a kid yet, but I’m pretty sure that they were gonna have that lion be the godmother.


[JACK Laughs]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Once they [ALI Laughs] had their firstborn. But you know, they got separated— it’s this whole thing. So they should be involved.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): I don’t know if that counts.


[ALI Laughs]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): [Slightly Offended] Godmother counts. You know, if somebody—


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Hypothetical godmother?


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Well, you know, they were gonna have a kid and they got separated. Also I can bring some of the— hmm, I don’t know if I’m gonna bring the hippo, the hippo can eat. The lions probably— the hippo’s mouth is kind of big. I can bring over some of the um…. 


ALI: I forgot it [Laughs Hard] a fourth time!


[JACK Laughs]


KEITH: Peccaries?


ALI: [Still Laughing] Peccaries!


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): We could get a peccary ring bearer. Just put little backpacks on those things and uh—


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): The lion will eat the peccary?


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Nah, me and Dax— they see the relationship me and Dax have, they’re cool. Me and Dax let them hang out all the time. Just so we can hang out, y’know? [Cross] We only have one—


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Slightly Panicked] [Cross] Waaahhh? You guys could just go to the cafe if you wanted to hang out!


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Well, we wanna watch Netflix while we’re working. [ALI Laughs]


[JACK Laughs]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): And we only have the one account, so… I had this like, pocket projector and we put it on the wall— oh we should do that for the wedding! Do you want me to get some flames for the—


[ALI And JACK Briefly Laugh Quietly Before Everyone Breaks Down And Laughs Hard, KEITH Claps]


[1:30:20]


JACK: “It’s the passion of love between to lions!” Oh my god... [KEITH And ALI Laugh] The— presumably there’s a whole fucking zoo’s worth of employees in this story and we’ve just been focusing in on these four losers.


JANINE: Oh god.


[A Few Scattered Laughs]


JANINE: I think Never’s just like, at this point, [ALI And KEITH Start Laughing Again] it is just like, a lot of sitting with her mouth open and nodding and being like “okay.”


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Exasperated] Okay. I need to make a ph— I have to make a phone call? Thanks so much for your help.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): You have my number. I’m just right here, you can talk to me.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): [Confused] I wasn’t... Yes, I certainly could. Okay, you go um… see how Dax is doing.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Okay, I’ll report back. I’ll text you.


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): You don’t need to.


[ALI Laughs]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): I’ll text you.


ALI: [Laughing Hard] And he just walks out and closes the door.


[JACK Laughs]


JANINE: Never puts her phone on “Do Not Disturb”


[ALI Laughs Hard]


JACK: So uh, it was pointed out in the chat, and I checked the rules— this final dice is actually Wild?


KEITH: Oh! Great!


JANINE: Dammit.


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


JACK: I didn’t say during the scene because it wouldn’t have been any different.


KEITH: For Janine.


JANINE: No, it makes a difference to me.

JACK: Yeah, right. But uh… Yeah.


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


JACK: Sorry Janine.


KEITH: That’s— I’m not— no ‘cause that means we have the option to have a really nice wedding, if that’s how it ends up going. And that’s what we’re gonna do. We’re gonna do the wedding right? We’re all gonna do the wedding?


JACK: Yeah.


ALI: [Laughs] Yeah?


JACK: I feel— [Laughs] I feel like it’s the wedding, right? But I feel like we should take time to establish the wedding. You know.


KEITH: What about it?


JACK: I feel like... So, who comes? And is this well-attended? Is there an entourage from Trenton like, angrily bringing a lion? I want a picture of this Lion vow renewal.


KEITH: Well, okay. So, I’ll give you— I’ll hit all those beats right now. Okay so here we go: Wedding is open to the public. It’s inside one of the enclosures. [JACK Laughs] It’s me as the um… I am officiating the wedding. I am wearing a sleeveless tuxedo.


[ALI Laughs]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Sick, Bro.


KEITH: I think that we’ve got uh.. We’ve got the… The lion. And..uh his best man, which is the [JACK Laughs] which is one of the leopards.


JACK: Dressed up as a New Mexican Black Lion?


KEITH: No. Regular leopard. They go back.


[JACK Laughs]


JANINE: Back to basics.


KEITH: Mhm. We’ve got a— the, um… The folks from Trenton bring back the lioness. And walk her down the aisle like it’s— like they’re her father.


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


KEITH: You know how that happens at weddings? They deliver— they gotta put on a good face. There’s tons of people here.


JACK: But they’re MAD right?


KEITH: Oh sure, they’re mad. They don’t like that this is happening. They don’t like that we strongarmed them into doing this. They don’t like that we’re getting all the good press and they’re getting all the bad press. BUT! They gotta smile for the camera or they’re gonna get hit even worse. So they’re delivering the lion, as part of the ceremony. We’ve got that clipped ear leopard as the maid of honor. We’ve got a peccary ring bearer.


[JACK Laughs]


KEITH: Um… And uh, so I think it’s me, Darren, Boots, and inside the enclosure, uh— Never do you wanna be inside the enclosure?


JANINE: Uh… not particularly [Laughs]


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH: Neither does Boots but I’m insisting.


JACK: Everybody’s favorite Canadian.


KEITH: Oh are you yourself or are you being the Canadian?


JACK: No I’m being me. I’m being myself.


KEITH: And outside the enclosure with Never is like, as many of— a zoo’s-worth— of people. As if everybody that could be in the zoo is here. Um, and:


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): We are gathered—


JACK: I mean, being real— 


KEITH: What was that?


JACK: If I was at a zoo— I’m being real. If I was at a zoo, and I heard “The lions are renewing their vows”


KEITH: “It’s time for the lions to renew their vows,” yeah!


JACK: I would— you know I would.


KEITH: yeah totally. This is hyper-clickable.


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Clears Throat] [Loud Speaking Voice] We are gathered here today to witness…  The renewal of holy matrimony between these two beautiful lions. Who were parted. And are now rejoined. If everybody could please, be quiet. They will now deliver vows to each other that they wrote themselves. 


[Long Silence]


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Choked Up] That was— that was beautiful. And um… [Clears Throat] [ALI, JACK, And KEITH Laugh] Would the peccary please come here?


JACK: Trot trot trot. Peccary just goes wandering off to the corner of the cage and starts chewing on some foliage.


KEITH: Um I… I take a ring and just sort of, hold it up to the lion. And she eats it ‘cause it’s a treat in the shape of a ring.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Clears Throat] I now reaffirm you as lions and lions. You may kiss the… cat.


JACK: (as Crowd): Horrayy!!!


KEITH: (as crowd): [Shrill And Loud, Away From Mic] Waoooooo!!!!


[Everyone Claps]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Shouting Over Claps] Everybody make noise, they love it! Let’s hear it!!!


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


ALI: Darren has some of those sprinklers. [Laughs] You know those—


KEITH: [Confused] Dou— wait, did you say “douse them with the sprinklers‘?


ALI: No no no! Darren has those— you know those Fourth of July sprinklers where you like light them up and—


KEITH: Oh! Like sparklers. Not like the sprinklers that you use to water.


JACK: You know the Fourth of July sprinklers? [Laughs]


JANINE: I was wondering if there was a callback to the safety sprinklers ‘cause there was fire involved.


[Everyone laughs]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Does anybody—


KEITH: Oh yeah and we’re all standing in front of like, burning [Laughing] flames! And it just says in text underneath. It just says— what was it? “The passion of two lions’ love”? What was it?


JACK: “The fiery passion between two lions”? What was it?


KEITH: [Laughing] “The fiery passion between two lions.”


JANINE: The important thing is— 


KEITH: Does anyone have anything to say to bless these two’s union?


ALI: Um…


JANINE: [Whispering] Darren needs to trigger his playlist.


[ALI Laughs]


JANINE: [Whispering] His like, wedding dance— wedding reception playlist, please c’mon! [Laughs]


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): I do have something to say. And I cannot express the way that it feels [ALI Laughs] seeing these two lions reunited, by words.


ALI: And then “I Believe In A Thing Called Love” kicks on behind him.


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


JANINE: [Laughing] Oh perfect!


ALI: And that song is the loudest song in the world.


[JACK And KEITH Laugh]


ALI: [Overwhelming Laughter] People are staring.


JACK: [Cross] The lions both jump.


ALI: [Cross] And he starts like, a dance number. Um, he’s doing the…[Laughs Hard] Just Dance 4 Hard Mode choreography.


KEITH: All of the big cats are watching super intently— this now rapidly flailing arms and legs,  like it’s a toy that someone is jiggling.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): I have something to say!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Oh Mister Boots.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Takes A Breath] I don’t know what we really accomplished here today.


[JACK Laughs]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Boots.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): I feel like—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Boots, look into the lion’s eyes and say this.


[Silence]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Get close! Look into his eyes.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Uncertain] I’m doi— okay...Okay. He doesn’t look super happy. [Silence]  What do I hafta say?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): I don’t know, what did you want to say? You started something, I interrupted you.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Oh! I was talking to the crowd.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah, but now say it to the lion.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Speak from your heart!


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Speak from your heart! It doesn’t hafta be to the lion. They don’t like, know what you’re saying. So just say what you’re gonna say.


[JACK Laughs]


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Please don’t eat me. Please don’t eat me. Please don’t eat me because I sent your wife to Trenton. Please don’t. Okay thank you.


KEITH: He puts a paw on your shoulder.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): Oh jesus!


[ALI And JACK Laugh]


KEITH: No, it’s very gentle. It’s a loving paw.


JACK (as Boots Bonus): [Uncomfortable] Is that what it means?


ALI: The crowd—


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): He knows what you’ve done.


JANINE: Gently puts Boots’ head in his mouth. Gently.


KEITH: You can see—


[ALI, JACK, And JANINE Laugh]


ALI: The crowd is applauding at this point


JACK: Like, tears, tears rolling down. What is Never doing? Like, boots looks up from the lion’s big brown eyes and sees Never. What is happening outside the enclosure?


JANINE: I think— so she’s like in the crowd right?? And I imagine there is someone… I am so strongly picturing someone like, standing behind her, who, whenever the song gets to the chorus and the guy sings like— what is it? “Rhythm of my heart” or whatever?


ALI:: Mhm.


JANINE: when he sings “heart” someone behind her just screams “lion,” Cliffy B-style.


[ALI And JACK Laugh Hard]


KEITH: Wait what’s Cliffy B-style?


JACK: You know what Cliffy B style is.


KEITH: No I don’t.


JANINE: He did a tweet and it was bad.


ALI: It was a fun karaoke joke.


KEITH: Oh right! [Laughs Hard]


JANINE: It was a fun karaoke bit that you do.


KEITH: It was a trick that he taught us.


ALI: He called it a trick [Laughing]


KEITH: He called it a trick!


JACK: Here’s a fun karaoke trick!


KEITH: What a doofus.


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: Ugh, god.


JANINE: I think Never is, in her head, completing Boots’ like, credit internship review.


JACK: [Laughs] Incredible.


[ALI And JANINE Laugh]


KEITH: Heart of ice.


JACK: So keith would you say this is a Black die or a White die?


KEITH: Hey this is— I set this scene up.


JACK: this is a White die, right? This is actually— we kinda nailed it, right?


JANINE: I think it depends on who but for Dax it is certainly White right?


KEITH: Yeah.


JACK: I think it’s White for boots. Boots was like— 


KEITH: I think it was yeah I think it was White for me and Boots.


JANINE:: It’s not looking white for Boots’ college credits.


JACK: It’s not or it is?


JANINE: It’s not. [Laughing]


KEITH: This technically fulfills— I mean, the scene went the way that I, Dax, wanted it. And it also fulfilled the “Needs to get respect from the one who left.”


ALI: Boots does not need to pass this class [Laughs]


KEITH: Both Boots and Darren.


JANINE: Uh, let me actually generate you a White die then. So it’s not confusing.


JACK: Boop!


JANINE: And then we’re just gonna put this here in the corner.


JACK: That— the curse of it going where like, that’ll be the point at which Dax was eaten by the lion, right?


KEITH: You need to give me access to this one die.


JANINE: Oh right, right. Sorry.


KEITH: It’s alright.


JANINE: [Mumbles] So I hafta figure out which— I should’ve just copy and paste it, is what I should’ve done. There we go all players.


KEITH: Cool.


JANINE: Okay.


JACK: Okay, we have played two acts of the Fiasco. I don’t think I anticipated it ending with a Lion wedding, when we began.


JANINE: I don’t think any of us did.


KEITH: I did, I had it written down.


JACK: Yeah, if we check Keith’s notes it just says ”lion wedding.”


KEITH: “Goals: Lion Wedding”


JACK: “I Believe In A Thing Called Love”


JANINE: Do we hafta roll our thing?


JACK: Yeah we do, I’m just gonna bring up the Aftermath-thing. And read through it. For the benefit of the listener. Uh, let’s see. Okay. Here’s a bunch of tables. I got a bunch of those in another tab. Um… Okay, here we— [Takes A Breath] Um. OH! This is interesting. It says “After the end of Act 2, you’ll have a modest pile of dice in front of you including all the dice allocated to your character in both acts. Roll all the dice and add all the White dice together and all the Black dice together and then subtract the higher from the lower. You should have about twice as many as before because you keep the dice allocated in the first act. So let’s just roll these.


KEITH: Mhm. Okay, so I’m uh… 6 White.


JACK: Okay. Um… It does say here “Note that if you end up with the game’s final die and decided that it was the opposite color, you can ignore that now. Other than choosing the outcome of the final scene, this choice has no effect. You don’t hafta remember that a White die is actually Black when rolling the Aftermath.” I don’t super-understand that.


[ALI Coughs]


KEITH: Wait, so does that mean I’m rolling two Black and two Whites still?


ALI: Mm..


JANINE: I think that, isn’t that just a way of saying that it’s Wild if you were assigned the last die, you get to ignore whatever color it is?


ALI: I think they’re saying if you have physical dice and had a Black die and changed it—


JACK: Oh!


KEITH: Oohh! I see.


ALI: So I’m 5?


JACK: 5?


ALI: Black.


JACK: You’re 5 Black.


KEITH: Uh, Jack you and I are both 6 White.


JACK: Keith and I are both 6 White. Ali?


JANINE: I’m 3 Black.


JACK: Okay, so. We want to get— it says here: “The Aftermath chart will give you your module which is your game’s finale. Black results are generally physical, and White results are generally social, mental, and emotional. You really, really don’t want those dice to cancel each other out. The further from 0 your final result, the happier the ending. At this point the game enters the final phase, the Aftermath. So. [Takes A Breath]  Let me bring this up on the screen so that the stream can see. “You can see here that we have Black High and White High aftermaths, that run from 0: The worst thing in the universe. This probably doesn’t include death since death would be way better than whatever this is. Right up there with Black 13+: Awesome. Insanely-great.


ALI: [Laughs]


JACK: Aftermath: White High. 0 “The worst thing in the universe” to  White 13+ Fan-Fucking-Tastic. Um, so. Let’s go around, starting with... Ali, I guess?


ALI: [Takes A Breath] Okay, so I have [Clears Throat] I have Black 5.

JACK: Uh, so—


ALI: Is that right?

JACK: Yeah, so.


ALI: I can read it.


JACK: Yeah, I was gonna read The Montage as well. But like—


ALI: Okay. [Laughs]


JACK: So we play the Aftermath as a montage, with one “This Is” statement, per die associated with our character. When we have no dice, the game is over.


ALI: Okay, wait we don’t go die-by-die, right? It’s just—


JACK: Uh, we go— you describe what Aftermath you have and once we know… Let’s say what Aftermaths we have and then go round, die-by-die, putting things in ‘cause that’ll—


ALI: Okay


KEITH: Each of us is doing one for four rounds? [JACK: Yeah, yeah.] Got it.


JACK: Yeah, one sentence starting with this is— As in like, I think “this is what happens to so-and-so.”


ALI: Okay, but it’s based off of the Black 5: Rough-thing?


JACK: Yes


KEITH: Yeah. We’re just starting off reading the Aftermaths— the text.


ALI: Yeah... So, Black 5: Rough “You’re getting whipped like a rented mule for starters, and you’ll remember this episode for all your diminished days. The lesson you learned will be profound, lingering, and painful.” Um, so. [Laughs] I think Darren gets like, caught in the zoo system. Um, he was really surprised that the second successful scam that he gets away with didn’t make a second million dollars for the zoo. Um... [Laughs] And y’know, he— he tries to get to manager, he tries to get an exhibit for himself. And he never quite gets there, he’s like a supervisor for years and years, and I think he’s like, “But that wedding went so well. I don’t understand why I’m not being appreciated the way I should be...”


JACK: Damn. Is that one of your dice? [Cross] Or do we wanna specifically see—


ALI: [Cross] Yeah, Black— Oh.


JANINE: I think you put them back in the middle, right?


JACK: Yeah, one at a time, as you describe about your character.


ALI: Okay but it keeps going back to Black 5? Or?


JACK: Yeah. Yeah it’s just using as—


JANINE: It’s your bracket, but it’s multiple little scenes that you—


ALI: Ohhh okay.


JACK:: So I got White 6, right, Keith?


KEITH:: Yeah.

JACK: Um, it is too late for me to do math, so I really appreciate you doing it for me. [Laughs]


KEITH: Yeah, no worries.


JACK: Um White 6, uh... This says uh… “Weak” [Laughs] Sure, this is Boots Bonus. “You’re busted, beaten, broken down. But at least you learned a lesson about human greed and frailty, right? It’ll serve you well in prison, which is where you’re probably headed—” I don’t think Boots is headed to prison. But I think that Boots is— I think we see Boots finishing his stint in the zoo. His internship. And he shakes Never by the hands and y’know, he goes and gives Dax and Darren a hug and gets back on a bus to Bluff City, proper. We just sorta see him looking out of the window of the bus, as the zoo kind of recedes. And he keeps thinking to himself like... “Man, I nearly got eaten by a lion.”


JANINE: I have a Black 3, which is “Harsh. Shit-in-a-bag harsh. A-lifetime-of-medication harsh. A big black cloud of hurt is gonna rain all over you. The things that you need to happen are not going to. Simple as that.”


[ALI Laughs]


JANINE: So I think that this is, uh... Y’know, Never has seen Boots off and it’s kind-of back to business as usual at the zoo, but it is just like, that bullshit has emboldened everyone at the zoo. Has emboldened all of the keepers to do some bullshit that she is just [JACK Laughs] kind-of stuck facilitating. So there is a lot of her being like, head down at the desk while like, the lemur keeper comes in and is like “What if we did, like a like, a lemur um... summer camp! And people could come see the lemurs? You know, making... crafts?” In the summer.


[JACK And KEITH Laugh]


JANINE: And she’s like, 


JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): Yeah, okay you need to provide the macaroni and the glue but… [Under Her Breath] Yeah, sure. Whatever.


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: Just completely broken down by it.


JANINE: Yeah. Yeah. Just like,
JANINE (as Never Watson-Wiley): It’ll be— People’ll click anything, whatever.


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH: I also got a White 6 which is Weak. Um.. And uh… [Clears Throat] I think the first thing that happens is the lions get a divorce.


[ALI Gasps And Then Laughs]


JACK: [Laughs] Oh my god! Keith!


KEITH:: There’s something about— 


JACK: What did we do all this for!?


KEITH: I— it— We thought it was gonna take and that lions, they mate forever but there was just something about having been in another zoo, and just, the smells were wrong.


ALI: Too much pressure on a young couple, y’know?


KEITH: Yeah, it just didn’t last.


JANINE: Long-distance relationships are hard and reuniting doesn’t make it better.


JACK: Especially if you’re a lion.


JANINE: Yeah.


KEITH: Yeah.


[Pause]


ALI: Okay, um… Okay [Laughs] Um…. So I think… What’s happening to Darren? I think— [Laughs] I think Darren gets transferred to Trenton Zoo.


JACK: [Gasps] Oh my god!


ALI: And it’s like, “What do you mean? I worked here forever! My mom lives three blocks away.” Like, “I need to work at the zoo, I’ve given my life to the zoo” and it’s like, “No you know you’re good at your job. And y’know we have this relationship with Trenton that you helped facilitated so y’know. You hafta go transfer to the zoo. We have an agreement now.” [Takes A Deep Breath] And it’s y’know, not the life that he wanted. It’s a long commute.


JACK: Um… Boots is researching sneezing monkeys, months later, on his computer in his bedroom. And he looks up a picture of one of the sneezing monkeys. And the reality of what was going on dawns on him— which I don’t think it did at any point during the game. [Laughs]


[ALI Laughs Hard]


JACK: And he just goes,


        JACK (as Boots Bonus): OH!


[JACK And JANINE Laugh]


JACK: And y’know, just goes— feels this degree of like, what’s the word? Slight distance from shame. In his part in the, the— 


JANINE: Complicity?


JACK: Complicity! That’s what I’m looking for. In the sneezing monkey scam.


JANINE: Um… I think this [Sighs] This scene is um… I think— [Laughs] Okay this scene is um… The zoo gets some fresh blood in like, part of the moving stuff around is like, part of— they move some zoo to Trenton and some people from Trenton move in. And there are some like, very very smart zoologists in that group. Some very smart biologists and stuff um, in that group. They’re also quite young. And quite like, attentive. So they follow the zoo’s social media and stuff, and they catch on to the monkey stuff.  And they’re like, “that’s not— that’s not what these are.” And they start going back through the archives and they’re like “All of this stuff is fake and nonsense. What’re you doing?” And I think the owners are like, content to maybe look the other way as long as she was getting traffic, which is arguable. [ALI Laughs] But it is a situation where like, there is some heat to do things right. In addition to the heat of like, everyone trying to do their own weird bullshit projects. So this is like, them bringing in a new social media person to quote-unquote “work alongside” Never. 


JACK: [Takes A Breath] And this actually functionally acts as her replacement?


JANINE: It’s probably one of those training-your-replacement-things.


JACK: Cool [Laughs] That didn’t work out great with boots


JANINE: No


KEITH: Um… Nobody cares about the hero exhibit


ALI: [Sympathetic Laughter]


JACK: [Laughs] [Sympathetic] Oh nooo!


JANINE: [Sympathetic] Aww.


KEITH: It uh... It looks really cool and I really thought that like, this was my time to shine. But um… The only people that every show by are punk kids that are trying to mess with me. And I let them get to me and I like, yell at them and… Sometimes I would scare them like, too— like, more than you’re allowed to scare kids. [Laughs]


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH: Like, [Laughs] so I think people were like, “Oh y’know, we thought that Dax was like, funny and kind of charming, but um… Like, he’s...scaring kids now?” [Laughs] “And it’s bad.”


ALI: [Takes a breath] Um, I think that Darren tries to put together like, a hobby sort-of YouTube marriage weddings channel?


JACK: [Intrigued] Hmm!


ALI: And he puts ads in the paper. And he makes tweets and he has a Facebook group and he’s like, all, you know. First it’s like “I’ll be an animal wedding organizer but you hafta let me record it, put it in my channel” But that doesn’t really get a lot of bites. So then he goes to dog parks— [Laughs] Tries to convince people, y’know, who are in the park “it’ll just take five minutes, I just hafta take this video.” It doesn’t really get off the ground. And I think he’s really bummed because he, y’know… Thought that he had a, y’know, a talent for animal weddings. And also he’s really confused why he hasn’t gotten a million dollars yet for having a good online video.


JACK: [Takes A Breath, Exhales Deeply] Boots… [Pause] Gets his grades… His internship report, through. And his professor— the supervisor— is not happy. I don’t know what’s sort of the gist of what Never wrote? In the report? Janine?


JANINE: Probably like, “Lets other zoo employees get him caught up in absurd schemes rather than doing assigned work,” like [JACK Laughs] “Needs heavy management” probably, is a big thing there. “Is not independent. Is not a self-starter.”


JACK: Uh, yeah. I think Boots hears all that, and hears it secondhand from his professor. And does not feel good about that situation. Also I love the fact that this professor would’ve received a report from a zoo that featured the words “Lets employees get him into absurd schemes,” [JANINE Laughs] which would just be an incredible thing to receive from a zoo. [Laughs] I guess the professor would also have heard about the lion wedding. ‘Cause like, is a resident of Bluff City and maybe lives nearby the zoo? Which just makes it all the more bitter for Boots, I think.


JANINE: Yeah… Um… I think that uh… Eventually, um, Never is let go from the zoo. Because her replacement is sufficiently trained up, so she’s no longer really needed there. Especially ‘cause like, the zoo… That probably helped the zoo temporarily, I don’t know if it helped the zoo long-term. So it’s not like they really needed a social media fleet.


[ALI Takes A Breath]


[1:59:55]


JANINE: Um.. So I think Never gets a job… I guess doing a social media job for one of the casinos, which I imagine is a lot less exciting and interesting than doing zoo stuff, where it’s like, 
“Ah, I’m just gonna post this video of these baby animals. And post this video of these kids how to, y’know, draw penguins or whatever.” Instead it’s like “Free Shrimp Fridays! Today! Friday... Get’em...” So I imagine that’s like, deeply unfulfilling in a way that really underscores just how much she liked the zoo work, [Laughs] but didn’t appreciate it properly with all her lying and stuff. [Laughs]


JACK: She liked those lion weddings.


[ALI And JANINE Laugh]


KEITH: [Clears Throat] Um… I think uh...With Darren working at Trenton, I think they see each other less and less, and the commute is rough. And it’s just like, not as much fun at the zoo. And uh, they just start drifting apart. And maybe eventually they’re not even best friends.


[ALI And JACK Sigh]


ALI: It’s what happens. It’s tough commuting an hour just to play Just Dance [Laughs]


[JACK Laughs]


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): Yeah, it’s tough commuting an hour. I have Let’s Dance[10] at home, I can see your scores online.


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): Will you still facetime me?


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Dejected] Y’know… Yeah…


ALI (as Darren Cruiser): … [Unconvinced] Okay, bro. Okay.


ALI: Um, is there something special about the final die? Or?


JACK: It’s just the last thing we hear of this character


JANINE: Mhm.


ALI: Okay. Um… I think that Darren’s um… budding—  [Laughs] His budding interest in animal weddings does start to take off a little bit.. There is a kind-of local school that had chicks that they were taking care of, and then when the chicks grew up, they brought the chicks back to the school to have a wedding. And that was his first big break in sort-of— he had a really good year of um, putting animal weddings together. And then it comes out that the lion wedding was a fake. All of the scandal about Bluff City Zoo. Um ,and he’s attached to that. So— 


KEITH: Wait, the lion wedding wasn’t a fake!


ALI: [Laughs] Well, wasn’t there bad press about the lion wedding?


JACK: Well, there was the divorce.


KEITH: [Reinforcing] There was the divorce.


ALI: [Laughs] I think the zoo getting caught up in all of that stuff still, y’know— 


KEITH: Right, there was definitely other fake stuff.


ALI: Yeah, yeah. Anyway, his lion wedding license gets taken away. So, his last dream is dashed in that way.


JACK: [Takes A Breath] Boots goes to visit the zoo, as a punter. And uh, the leopards have had their— 


KEITH: Sorry. As a what?


JACK: As a punter? As like, uh…


KEITH: Like a— Do you like, kick a football?


[ALI And Jack Laugh]


JACK: [Unsure] No? Like a paying guest.


ALI: [Comprehending] Mmm.


KEITH: I’m not the only one that didn’t get that, right? We all didn’t get that?


JANINE: [Laughing] I also didn’t know that


ALI: I didn’t know that.


JACK: It’s like a british slang for a person who pays to go do a thing, y’know—-


KEITH: P-U-N-T-E-R, Punter?


JACK: Yeah


ALI: Like a customer, you mean?


JACK: Yeah, but like a customer who— 


JANINE: No I like the football thing more. [Chuckles]


[ALI Giggles Excitedly]


JACK: [Chuckles] He goes there as a punter. And he, y’know, he sees this New Mexican Lions, that have had their coats— which were actual like, fur coats, right? With manes sewn on?


KEITH: Yeah. Fur coats.


JACK: They’re not wearing those anymore. There are two separate lion pens. One with the lioness and one with the lion in. And uh, I think that we last see Boots, y’know, still in his impermeable. Kinda just like, leaning against the wall of the lion’s pen, and just looking inside. And the lion looking back at him. And there sort-of being like, a glimmer of cold recognition in both of these characters’ eyes.


[ALI Laughs, Janine Chuckles]


JANINE: Um… I think uh… The last we see of Never Watson-Wiley is, she is standing in front of a very large aquarium at the casino. And she is looking at the fish. And she’s looking at her phone. And, y’know, she’s trying… She feels like the easy answer is what it was before, which is to find a fish that was newly discovered, that people might find interesting. Like, if there was some kind-of fun gimmick— like sneezing— people love animals that sneeze, so like, people. But there isn’t really like— there’s no sneezing fish. There’s also just like, fish that get discovered because the ocean is big and we don’t know much about it and it’s all so overwhelming. So I think the last we see of Never Watson-Wiley is her standing in front of this aquarium with her phone, and someone nearby is a tourist who is like, they broke— they drop their phone on the casino floor. And they’re really upset and they’re freaking out. And Never turns and walks towards them and hands them her phone— like, takes her sim card out and hands them her phone, and just leaves the casino.


[Long Pause]


JANINE: [Mumbling] I should move my die.


KEITH: Um.. [Clears throat] Dax is... on the run. Because he was talking to the rest of the big cats and… thought maybe they should be reintroduced to the wild— [JACK Laughs] the zoo is no place for animals, anymore. They don’t deserve to be here. It’s time to let ‘em go. And um… The police did not think that that was… [ALI, JACK, And JANINE Laugh] a very good idea. And he has skipped town, for now.


JACK: [Takes A Breath] What’s the last thing we see of him?


KEITH: He makes it to uh… He makes it to his favorite spot on the boardwalk, to get a large order of his favorite chicken tendies, with honey mustard. And he’s wearing [Laughs] Groucho Marx glasses, and he boards a bus… [Dramatically] With a one way ticket.


JANINE: [Dramatically] Going anywhere.


[ALI Laughs]


KEITH: [Dramatically] Anywhere.


KEITH (as Dax Leopard): [Dramatically] Whaddya got? What’s the farthest I can get with $18?


[JACK, JANINE And KEITH Laugh Hard]


JANINE: “Across town? Like—”


ALI: “To DC maybe?”


JACK: Well. We made a zoo. We put it through some— some [Laughs] times. And we all ended a little sad. And some of us ended a lot sad. Waves continue to beat against the shore of Bluff City. And uh… [Laughs] Things are still pretty messed up in that zoo. Thank you so much everybody for coming out to this live show. I know it was long. And I know it was a complete fiasco in every respect.


[JANINE Laughs]


JACK: But I really appreciate it.


[ALI Laughs]


JANINE: Late Title Card: “Complete Fiasco”


JACK: [Laughs] Late— Com— Late Title Card: “Complete Fiasco”


[ALI And KEITH Laugh]


JACK: S— [Laughs] Bee Old in the chat says— Jesse M. in the chat says “We Failed A Zoo” That’s the title.


[ALI Laughs]


JACK: I’m Jack de Quidt. You can find me on Twitter @notquitereal and you can by any of the music featured on this podcast at notquitereal.bandcamp.com Who else is here?


Ali Um, I’m here! I’m Alicia Acampora, you can find me @ali_west on Twitter.com. You can also find @friends_table on Twitter.com— that is the show. This was really fun. We’re a little behind on Lives— I think we should be doing another one [Uncertain] soon-ish? Maybe? There’s a game I wanna play that also has a complicated character building system, and depends on dice for a bunch of shit, so maybe we’ll be back with that soon-ish.


JANINE: Uh, I’m Janine Hawkins. I’m @bleatingheart on Twitter.


KEITH: I’m Keith J Carberry, you can find me on Twitter @keithjcarberry, you can find the Let’s Plays that I do on YouTube.com/RunButton We just started doing Mario Galaxy [ALI: Ooo] And we also just started a new way of picking our Patreon-exclusive Let’s Play. Which is Run Button Pilot Week, [Jack: Ooo!] Kyle and I are each picking one—  


ALI: Ooo!


JANINE: That’s such a good idea!!


KEITH: We’re each doing one— picking one game that we want to maybe do, playing one episode of it, releasing it to everybody. And then at the end, you can— patrons can vote on which one they want to see.


JACK: Wow, that’s phenomenal.


JANINE: Mhm


JACK: That’s on your YouTube? That we can see those pilots?


KEITH: That’s on our YouTube, yeah. YouTube.com/RunButton We uploaded Spyro: Reignited, which we’re probably gonna do Year of the Dragon for. Although we could end up doing any of the three. And then upcoming is also Hitman 2, the new— the 2018 Hitman—


JANINE: I’ve heard of that one.


[JACK Laughs]


KEITH: Yeah, so we’ve got that one, we’ve also got the Rare Replay Collection and then we got three more that we have yet to record, so those’re—


JACK: Damn. [Cross] That’s really exciting.


KEITH: [Cross] Spyro’s up, you’ll get to hear coming up.


JACK: I’m suddenly excited for a pilot of Let’s Play’s which is a thing I didn’t know one could be excited about! [Cross] It’s a concept that I think you invented.


[JANINE Laughs]


KEITH: [Cross] Yeah, we didn’t know it until we had the idea a couple weeks ago [Chuckles] Yeah— wait! We’ve invented a couple con— The whole “Let’s Play”— the entire series of a long-ass thing, we invented that too.


JACK: Ooh [Laughs]


JANINE:  Mhm. Mario. Sonic— you invented both of those, I don’t know where your money is.


KEITH: Yeah, right!? Yeah, I mean the Sonic-thing, for real? I’m pretty sure no one had ever done anything like that when we did that. Pretty sure.


JACK: No one’s ever married two lions— 


KEITH: I’m pretty sure. If somebody wants to prove me wrong, then @ me on twitter, but…


JACK: Thank you everybody for coming out. I’m gonna fall asleep at me dang desk.


[ALI Laughs Hard]


JANINE: Mhm


ALI: Bye!


KEITH: Bye


JACK: I will see you all soon! Bye!
