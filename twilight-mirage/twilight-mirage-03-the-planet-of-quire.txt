Twilight Mirage 03: The Planet of Quire


AUSTIN (as Satellite): Report 80-Alpha. So, um, how you holding up, Primary? It’s been I guess about a month since Gumption died? And Empyrean and ...Blooming..., they’ve been watching the people of The Fleet mourn the death of yet another Divine, and I’ve been watching them. By definition, faith is supposed to be invisible, but the hope of the Fleet has always been...just really material. It’s been right there in their parades and their songs and their tears and sweat and their fists all clenched up after a wound. But with Gumption and ...Covenant... gone? If their hope yet lived, I registered no material evidence. That’s why they finally acted, Primary. For a long time, Empyrean has held one law to be true above all others, you know this: steal no one’s perch. All the other Divines of the Fleet had pursued and pretty much failed at colonization efforts; Empyrean and the people of Seance hadn’t. Their domain was the sky not the land, they were Empyrean, right? The highest of highs, the most heavenly of heavens, Dreamt first by the Divines themselves, quote-unquote. But now the people needed a sign, they needed an investment in hope. And so suddenly they started looking for a perch. I watched them scour the records of the Memorious library. I watched them find a new home, or what looked like one anyway. A world of singing storms and howling seas, deserts and mountains, lakes and forests and swamps and ice. A planet with as much diversity as the citizens of the Fleet. And I observed relief in ...Blooming...’s eyes when she found the loophole. Records indicated that on multiple occasions over the last 800 years, people had fled the Fleet and wound up on the planet. “Perhaps,” I overheard her telling Empyrean, “this wasn’t someone else’s perch at all.” Before they vanished, the Divine Curiosity named that planet: Quire. Do you know the word, Primary? Q-U-I-R-E. Definition 1: A collection of 24, or sometimes 25, sheets of paper of the same size and quality. “Sometimes 25,” it’s so very Curiosity, isn’t it? Definition 2, archaic: an organized group of church singers. Definition 3: A division of angels.

AUSTIN: And Andrew Lee Swan


DRE: Hey uh you can find me on Twitter @swandre3000


AUSTIN: And I am Austin Walker again, you can find me on Twitter @Austin_Walker and you find the podcast now on Patreon at friendsatthetable.cash. We have a bunch of goals we already kinda talked to you about them in the past. We actually just recorded our first episode of Bluff City, which is- which was great, uh, it’s a game set in a fictionalized Atlantic City, it’ll be coming out later this month, or at least the first part of it will, the first episode in the set will be. We played a game of Fiasco, there was a bird involved, the word “sports” came up a bunch.


SYLVIA: There were a bunch of birds involved.


DRE: Mmhm


AUSTIN: There were a number of birds. There was boxing. The mafia. It’s a lot of stuff. You should listen to that. You can listen to that for just $5 a month so if that sounds interesting to you you should definitely sign up. Again that’s friendsatthetable.cash. But today we are getting to the planetside of our game of The Veil, which was a game designed by Fraser Simons. My agenda today is to make the world feel real, to make it hightech and to make it personal, to make the protagonists’ lI'ves interesting and interconnected, and to play to find out what happens. We should start by talking about characters actually- actually we should start by saying this our second attempt to kick this off. We actually, like, threw an episode out, which we’ve never done before, because we wanted to change up some things around characters and characterization. I guess the big one there is, like, we aren’t using The Empath playbook anymore. KEITH was going to originally play an empath, which we announced during the worldbuilding. KEITH let’s start with you, what’s your new character situation?


KEITH: Hi my new character is The Telepresence, which is a character I didn’t know existed


AUSTIN: It didn’t- We didn’t have access to it until, y’know

OVERLAPPING
KEITH: We didn’t-


AUSTIN: Like you know full transparency-


KEITH: We had already decided- we had already decided “hey let’s redo this first episode” and then, then you were like “hey there’s these new playbooks that you’ve never seen.”


AUSTIN: “You should check these out.” And one of them was really dope and also [KEITH: Yeah] offered a chance to hit something that we hadn’t had in the original party. So what’s The Telepresence and what is your look, what is your character’s name and what is their jam and-


KEITH: Sure. My character’s name is Gig Kep-hart-


AUSTIN: -Fuck.


KEITH: [LAUGHS] My look mostly didn’t change, cause like the look was like, so the thing, one of the things I was unsatisfied with about the first episode was that I never- I never felt interested in coin or the Empath stuff in the same way I was excited about, like, the Gumption’s Gambit stuff-


AUSTIN: Right


KEITH: -that I really liked and thought was cool.


AUSTIN [overlapping]: Right so a thing that really showed up in the shipside game, something with Gumption’s Gambit’s and Gumption’s excerpt being a person who plugs in a bunch of cables to make a mech move is really cool. Very fiddly analog synth style operator tech


KEITH [overlapping]: Yeah if you look at my- My one essential visual tag Just Google Image Search like an old moog and it’s just like wires everywhere [AUSTIN: Right right] and it’s like somehow making this really amazing sounding music from a bunch of plugs


AUSTIN, overlapping: nonsense wires


KEITH: Yeah exactly. So uh Gig is uh, so I've got a lot of that stuff held over from coin, heavily patched seafoam jeans, I’ve got a low white tanktop with a light pink jacket, light, um- light jacket not light pink, sort of dyed light hair but dark facial hair. No beard, just not clean shaven. And I just, I picture most people from gumptions gambit wearing something that seems really slapdash but also coordinated. Like this is all stuff lying around but you thought about what what you had lying around, y’know


AUSTIN: Like it’s laundry day but you’ve got enough stuff to make a look


KEITH: Right like before you threw together a random set of clothing you knew that you would be throwing together a random set of clothing. And I think that, I don’t know this for sure, but I think The Telepresence might be the only class that already has a jam filled in. 


AUSTIN: Yeah that’s correct. [second guessing] I think that’s true.


KEITH: So like the verbatim thing that it says for The Telepresence which I think is still applicable says:  “Your jam is broadcasting yourself to the world. Not just what you hear and what you see, but everything, what you feel, what you think about during the piece you broadcast, associated memories even the things you imagine so long as you’re plugged in, and you get cred to do so.” So external to any piece of cyberware that I might choose to have the telepresence can basically livestream their life to-


AUSTIN, overlapping: You're a vlogger i gotcha-


KEITH: yeah [LAUGHS] I’m a vlogger- I’m a head vlogger. Like I can to anything from just showing you what I’m seeing, to like adding weird chiron of my internal monologue over that [AUSTIN: right right totally] or showing you a flashback to a different thing


AUSTIN: And I think that the- for me what the thing you’re being sent to do is watch the group and report back on- I mean the pitch you’ve kind of given this for me for this character is that he is- he basically like OSHA work safety style vlogging 


KEITH: Yeah imagine like an entertaining version of OSHA where my job is “hey does somebody need to fix something outside the ship? He’s like “I’m gonna tag along and film it and it’s gonna be fun and interesting” but it’s also gonna- I’m also there to make sure that they have all the safety equipment that they need and that the way that they’re doing the job is gonna be safe for the people living on that part of the ship and making sure like that people get the things that they need in order to stay safe.


AUSTIN: Which like-


KEITH, still talking: Which I think is a really idealized version of OSHA-


AUSTIN: -Yes-


KEITH: -Like the idea that OSHA has the resources to actually fix things is funny, but this is a world where they do.


AUSTIN: The thing that- one of the things we were missing from the first recording was like someone in the party representing a notion of oversight to make sure that y’all werent going to this planet and fucking it up for the people who are already living here right?

KEITH: Mmhm.


AUSTIN: And now there's a character who at least you know in terms of their duty has that job.


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Whether or not that actually hap-I don’t know y’all could still fuck it for people here I-Y’know [DRE LAUGHS] we’ll see how the dice roll and your decisions are but that was important to me. Especially in contrast to what ended up happening with The Empath and the way that The Empath had been written and I ended up talking to Fraser about this and we ended up trying to hack in rules that we felt more comfortable with but like some of the stuff with Empath trying to get some of its unique playbook currency kind of like its psychic ammunition ended up encouraging a really sort of like shitty play that was around not dealing with consent in a useful or like adult way and like encouraging this sort of like “Ehhh I really need this psychic ammo even though this character, who isn’t like a threat to me, does not want me zapping their emotions.”And it was just bad, it was just like not good. So I’m glad that we pivoted off of that and I think we have kind of everything. We don’t need to go over moves or anything. But um, what I would like to go over is your faith questions here. And I don’t know if anyone’s looked at those yet.


KEITH: Yes. I looked at them and could not decide at all which one I thought I wanted. So I- I decided to leave it up until the moment.


AUSTIN: Well like, pick all of them, right? So the first one is: “If you’ve stopped a story going out that would’ve ended with somebody else in the party-” or an npc, I guess [AUSTIN YAWNS] excuse me “being harmed emotionally or physically you have one faith on them.” Have you ever spiked a story because it would’ve made somebody else look bad? Or not look bad but would’ve harmed them, there's a big difference there.

Keth: Get hurt?

AUSTIN: Yeah there’s definitely a difference there


KEITH: That one sounds the most believable. That one’s- of the three. We can go over the others if you want to.


AUSTIN: Yeah yeah so the next one is “If someone’s helped you cover up a part of your past that would’ve otherwise made you unable to be a telepresence they have one faith on you.” Um, “if you have cabled with someone and they have learned a secret about you that they have kept from you for your benefit they have one faith on you.” Uhhhh- [KEITH:Mmm] Which is interesting too. One thing I’ll note is you’re the only with this technology. This tech that you have lets you basically broadcast to everybody inside of the Twilight Mirage.


KEITH: Yeah


AUSTIN: Which is not a thing, we’ve talked about it, the only way to get a message from the Twilight Mirage or from one ship from one ship in the Twilight Mirage to another is to go to a special phonebox that hooks up with a huge laser antennae that makes a direct connection. And only a few handful of people per ship have access to those things because the last thing that people want, it’s a security, you don't want everybody on the ship whos hooked into the Mesh to be able to do that, so this is like an experimental piece of technology as part of this colonization effort which, in the intro I mentioned is a very experimental thing for Empyrean who does not believe in colonization basically. Like Empyrean is very much a you should float on your own wings and not like ever risk taking a perch from somebody else and so you’re kinda making sure that to the best of your ability that is going to be lived up to. So yeah, thoughts from the table on those faith questions? Has anyone ever been protected, has anybody anyone ever had a story that would’ve harmed them and- and uhhhh Gig stopped it? I’m not even sure what that story would be.


SYLVIA: Iiiii have a vague idea for one actually. So the first time we recorded we talked a little bit about how they were training on the ship there and I’m assuming we’re gonna keep elements of that. And so if this is being broadcast back to the ships one of the things that Gig could’ve done is cut footage of Echo not being able to train because of them not having the nanites that let them access the Mesh.


AUSTIN: Mmhm right yeah that’s interesting


KEITH: Yeah I like that


AUSTIN: Yeah go ahead


SYLVIA: Okay


AUSTIN: Go ahead, so take one faith on Echo. Has anyone else helped um, I keep wanting to say Kip, Kip which is wrong, Gig-


SYLVIA: -Gig


AUSTIN: -cover up part of his past that would’ve otherwise made him unable to be a telepresence? I don’t know what that thing would’ve been, it doesn’t sound like-


DRE: Yeah I don’t like, I wouldn’t feel comfortable being like “KEITH, here’s this deep dark secret that maybe I could’ve covered up for you.” [laughing]


KEITH: I uh- yeah I also- I picture, I picture uh, I don’t wanna say vanilla, I don’t picture Gig as a very vanilla guy. But I don’t- I can’t, I can’t, like, incorporate a characterization of like, a deep dark secret-


DRE: Right


KEITH: -into what i know about the character so far.


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah. Um. And then vice versa, is like, does anyone have a secret that they’ve kept from Gig for his benefit? Maybe you don’t even know what that is yet, but. [PAUSE] Alright sounds like no. Gig, 3 beliefs, what are they?

KEITH: Sure um, I have uh: “Everything I’ve ever seen or felt could be useful to me again.”


AUSTIN: Okay. [brief cross talk] I’m not sure that’s actionable but we can work on that between sessions.


KEITH: Yeah I’ve got: “I can change any situation with my knack for positive thinking.”

AUSTIN: That’s gonna get you into trouble which is good.


KEITH: And then I’ve got: “Echo values life on this planet as it already is and I will back up their instincts.”

AUSTIN: Okay. I can see that being a good party, y’know, a good way of making the party have to debate some shit. So yeah, Echo, let’s go to you. Let’s start with who you are, what you look like, what your class and stuff are- is. 


SYLVIA: Uh so Echo is The Honed playbook which means that they 1) are disconnected from any Mesh or the Mirage or whatever


AUSTIN: Right


SYLVIA: We have like 300 terms for it


AUSTIN: We do [LAUGHS]


SYLVIA: But they’re disconnected from all of that so they don’t see the sort of augmented reality that everyone else does, but they’re also an incredible- athletically and is a fighter and things like that? So it’s sort of, like, their whole thing is based around basically being free from that stuff and wanting to protect people. Um- And I took that- that’s kinda what Echo is like too. Like Echo was a criminal on the Tides. We mentioned this in the world building, I’m just gonna try and sum it up pretty quick. The Tides of Harmony who was brought onto this mission by...Empyrean, I think we decided on?


AUSTIN: Yeah.


SYLVIA: Instead of serving like a jail sentence of some kind. Um, and they’re basically doing this as a sort of, like, way to get their freedom back.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Which is interesting because, I guess it won’t, I guesssssss...we’ll have a look in the future. I was trying to remember what episode orders are.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Shortly on the other side of the game about what prison means in a utopian, y’know, technical or technologically hyper-advanced society, so stay tuned for that.


SYLVIA: Yeah. So let me just go over, like, look stuff I guess real quick? First of all, most important thing is that Echo is genderfluid. They’re like, very androgynous, and they go by they/them pronouns. For their overall look is- I have it written down as “Indigenous” cause that’s what‘s in the playbook, but Echo is a Native American person, I wanted to make sure that was clear. Then they’re just the- I’ll go down the appearance stuff I have written down from the playbook. They have “fine-boned face,” “versatile wear.” Which, to me, is like for the most part is very functional. They’re wearing this tight- like athletic crop top thing, and then like these kinda baggy military pants that they can keep stuff in. But the one thing, because, so, I talked about it a bit. The Tides’ culture is all about making things yourself. The thing that they have is one of those embroidered silk bomber jackets.


AUSTIN: Oh sick. 


SYLVIA: And it’s got a like, [sighs]. So I was torn between two things, so I decided to put them together. It’s got a tiger fighting an eagle on the back.


[AUSTIN and ART laugh]


AUSTIN: Good.


SYLVIA: And they made that themselves. Like completely from themselves. And then for their build- oh they also have- I changed their hair color just from being long, dark hair to long, dark, blue hair because I wanted it to be more anime.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


SYLVIA: And also, like yeah. I listened to the first episode and was like “Fuckin Ali’s blowing us all out of the water here. I need to do something.” [AUSTIN chuckling in the background] They also have a, like, because they have a sword, they have this big, rectangular sheath that sorta hangs off their- like horizontally off their back. And they’re kinda built like a gymnast for the most part. But the description is just like honed body. Just like a small martial artist. They're like… 5’6” I think is what I said? They’re pretty short.

AUSTIN: They’re pretty short, okay.


SYLVIA: Anyway. You wanna do questions or should I go through beliefs?


AUSTIN: Let’s uh let’s go through beliefs first. 

SYLVIA: Okay so, the main belief I have, the first one, which just instantly jumped was “If someone doubts you, prove them wrong.”


AUSTIN: Mhmm.


SYLVIA: The second, and this actually is pretty interesting ‘cause I didn't know what Gig’s beliefs were, is “Don’t let Gig use you for entertainment.”

AUSTIN: Oh, interesting.


SYLVIA: Because Echo doesn't really trust the whole Telepresence thing.


AUSTIN: Mhmm.


SYLVIA: So that, that’s interesting with Gig wanting to back Echo up.


[SYLVIA, KEITH, and AUSTIN talking over each other] 
        
AUSTIN: Yeah. I actually-
        
KEITH: Mmhmm. And also because like-
        
SYLVIA: And then-


KEITH: Yeah. I also like it because like, I’m like a big walking Mesh. 


AUSTIN: Right.

KEITH: Like I’m my own separate Mesh Man.


SYLVIA [LAUGHING]:  Big Mesh Man.


KEITH: And like part of our whole, part of our whole job is to, like, is to make this world where you feel more comfortable in because there isn't the Mesh like, difficult for you to use again.


AUSTIN: Totally.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: That’s interesting.


SYLVIA: My final belief is “Make sure that the Mirage isn’t being forced on Quire.” Quire being the planet we’re on. Echo doesn't want this being, like, thrust upon these people that live on this planet unwillingly.


AUSTIN: Cool! Yeah let’s go through, let’s go through faith. Uhhhhhh, sorry I should read, uhhhhh then you’ll answer. [SYLVIA talking over him]
        SYLVIA: Oh do you wanna read it? Okay.


AUSTIN: Yeah we got it. “If you’ve saved someone before and asked for nothing in return, you have one faith on them.” Who, has anyone been saved by, by Echo?


SYLVIA: Does anyone have any feelings towards this or 


ART: That fits like my general level of preparedness


SYLVIA: yeah i like it for arts character [AUSTIN laughing]  who i'm not naming yet-


AUSTIN: yep!


SYLVIA: -Because i want art to have that moment-


AUSTIN: Yep! We’ll go there next.


ART: I appreciate it


SYLVIA: So i’ll write that down


AUSTIN: “If someone protected you from something specifically because you have no neurochip, they have 1 faith on you.” I think we’ve already hit kinda with Gig-


SYLVIA: Yeah  


AUSTIN: -so I don't want that to, that shouldnt become two that's the same thing


SYLVIA: okay


AUSTIN: tho there is room there for like did somebody else literally physically help you through a thing. Through like a training moment, a training montage where 


SYLVIA: says smomething indistinguishable


AUSTIN: If you had a chip you would be able to see something and someone else grabbed you and pointed you in the right direction.


SYLVIA: I think Gardener could've done that if DRE’s cool with that


AUSTIN: Yeah me too. I kind of have DRE’s character in my mind as the person who would do that for sure. So DRE take 1 faith on Echo. And then “If you see or know a truth about smne because you have no neurochip and keep it secret you have 1 faith on them.” I don’t think that's true here buddy.


SYLVIA: I don't think that works because with, well especially because when we land there's no Mesh here


AUSTIN: Uh-huh right


SYLVIA: So nah


AUSTIN: Cool. Alright. So let’s go to Art. 


[TABLE LAUGHS]


AUSTIN: So hi Art.


ART: Hi.


AUSTIN: So people in the fan Discord, which you know, if you go to the Patreon i think there's a link out to it there, have been guessing that your name is “Space Chad.” I think someone said the words “Space Chad'' at some point and, I think that that’s-


ART: Yeah Ali. Ali started “Space Chad” [AUSTIN: Ohhhkay.] If we’re calling people out.


AUSTIN: Okay naming names over here


 KEITH: Wow Ali got “Space Chad” and “Flesh Diva?”


[TABLE LAUGHS]


AUSTIN: Ummmm, but your name is not Space Chad.


ART: It’s not.


AUSTIN:  Who is your character?


ART: The character is Grand Magnificent.


AUSTIN: [Snorts] Fuck. [KEITH laughing in the background] Goddamnit. 


ART: No it’s fine, you love it. 


AUSTIN: [sighing] Ugh. Tell me about your character. So what’s your playbook? 


ART: My playbook is “The Aesthetic.” 


AUSTIN: Mjmm. Which is, uh, someone who makes works of artwork.


AUSTIN: Yes


ART: Grand Magnificent makes mechs. Makes giant robots that do...things.


        OVERLAPPING


        AUSTIN: Right you’re an artist-


        ART: All sorts of things.


AUSTIN: -who, y’know. The thing I love about your character- the thing I like about this whole season does feel a bit like a response to “We could’ve built them to look like anything we made them look like us.” You’re the person who made them look like X. You’re the one who’s like “Oh I’m gonna make it look like ‘whatever’ and then have an effect from that.”


ART: Sure. Yeah. That is...that is the idea. Yeah. Yeah, and I- I really thought I had a page of notes that I don’t have from the last one. [AUSTIN LAUGHS ] Like I didn't write down any of the answers I gave to what this character looks like last time.


AUSTIN: Good. Great.


ART: So we’re gonna, I wrote down the most important thing


AUSTIN, anticipating some Bullshit™ : Uh-huh


ART: which is like, the neon-colored flannel.


AUSTIN: Right, that is important. That. Yeah.


ART: Yeah, that is the most important. I think I’ve like, I’ve- I’ve thought about it so much more. Grand Mag is an unassuming, uh y’know, physical presence, of course. I imagine that he’s, he’s a little, he’s probably like a little physically stronger than average by virtue of like he’s probably had to move some heavy shit around. 


AUSTIN: Yeah. Yeah.


ART: But he’s not like, he’s not like really strong, not like- 


OVERLAPPING


AUSTIN: -He’s not a soldier. He’s not an athlete, he’s not a, he’s nothing-


ART: Yeah he’s probably not even the strongest dude at your gym. 


AUSTIN: I would hope not. My gym has a lot of strong people. 


KEITH: Yeah, yeah.


ART: Well see, yeah. 


[DRE LAUGHS]


ART: Yeah, but even a less good gym. 


AUSTIN: Ohhh okay I see [LAUGHS]


ART: Ummm, and he’s like, he has this like, this- this kinda disinterested look on his face a lot of the time. I thought about how, the like, and maybe I should let this come out in play, so if you say yes we can cut this out. But the like, the des- he made the decision to leave for this mission when, like, he was at a party, and like, he’d been drinking for a while but had sorta come out the other end of being buzzed [AUSTIN: Mmhm], and Party Rock Anthem [AUSTIN LAUGHS] was on for the 4th time that night. And he looked around and was like “I don’t really like any of these people.”


AUSTIN: That should stay in. 


OVERLAPPING


ART: And then yeah. In the morning he was like “Yep let’s go.” I’m just, I’m just over this. 


AUSTIN: And then he was like “Yeah. I’ll say yes to this offer.”


ART: So went to the-


AUSTIN: He left Space Williamsburg.


ART: He left Space Williamsburg and went to the Space Camping Store [AUSTIN LAUGHS] and bought all of the gear he thought he needed, which includes this, y’know I think I want this purple and neon green flannel vest-


AUSTIN: God. God.


ART: And, y’know a brand-new-


KEITH, overlapping: Well it’s so you don’t get shot when you go hunting. 


AUSTIN, laughing: Yeah right, Ofc


ART: And a brand-new Swiss Army Knife [AUSTIN, trying not to laugh: Mmhm] , or like a Leatherman, or let’s be honest, none of these brands.


AUSTIN: Yeah, none of these brands are around.


KEITH: Oh you don’t think Swiss Army Knife is gonna last?


AUSTIN: No! I don’t think-
        
OVERLAPPING
        
KEITH: Y’know. [LAUGHS] For 400,00 years in the future?
        
AUSTIN: Well- 
        
ART: I don’t think it’ll last 400,000 years after the nation of Switzerland.


AUSTIN: It’s a neutrality brand uhhhhhhh fuckin’ knife. It’s a army knife from the Divine Neutrality.


KEITH, speaking over him: It’s a Switch Army Knife, it changes its logo depending on which army you’re in.


AUSTIN: Right. Good.


KEITH: Yeah.


ART: And just like, yeah. A brand new backpack and all of this stuff. Like, water purification tablets. Just like, they really saw him coming at the camping store.


[KEITH LAUGHS]


ART: They’re like “Yeah you definitely need alligator repellent.”


AUSTIN: So this whole playlist is about art, right. Like the thing that’s nice about this for me- not Art the person, like creating artistic works.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: And I love that they’re like, choose one or make your own! Architecture, sculpting, painting, music, poetry. And we were like: What if we made mechs? [LAUGHS]


ART: Yeah just, just really out there, esoteric mechs.


AUSTIN: Um. Let’s talk about beliefs next.


ART: Okay. My first belief is: “I will lend my genius to these quaint colonialists and through that will find new authenticity.”


AUSTIN: This fucking guy. [KEITH LAUGHS] This fucking guy. [SNORTS]


ART: My second one is: “Echo has led a life worth living, I will find a way to distill that essence into my work.” And the third one is: “I will find the hidden Divine and it will validate my work by letting me build it a new body.”


AUSTIN: [Clicks his tongue] Uh, yeah. The three things that you’re on this planet to do, on Quire to do is locate a- or spread the Twilight Mirage in preparation for a colony to be built. Two is to bring back into the fold those who left the Fleet over the last 300 years to come here, which you don't know anything really about, and there are rumors of a Divine, of a living Divine on this planet and y’know. If that’s- I guess if you wanna build it a new body, that’s totally a way to live your life. 


SYLVIA: Good.


ART: Yeah, I’m gonna meet God-


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


ART: -and God’s gonna be- and me and God are gonna be immediately best friends-


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


ART: And then God’s gonna be like “I need help being God, can you help me be God better?”

AUSTIN, so tired: God. Yeah. Great. Perfect. Let’s go over your Faith questions. [LAUGHS] Before I fuckin’ quit. [KEITH laughing in bg] Uhhhh. 


AUSTIN: “If you used your art to help someone articulate something important to them that they otherwise never could have, you have 1 Faith on them.”


Art: Yeah I think that’s consistent with DRE.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


DRE: Mmhm.


AUSTIN: Who you built a mech for, right?


Art: Yeah.


AUSTIN: So what is the thing- I guess DRE, what is the thing that the mech that Grand Magnificent built you, what does that kind of help you articulate that you never could have articulated without it?


DRE: Ummm. I think maybe it’s- it’s two things? I think one of the main things is that it was probably built after Gardener had his like, uh multi-tool, or his omnitool kind of installed?


AUSTIN: Mhmm. Mhmm,


DRE: And I think probably Grand Mist- Grand Magnificent built the mech in a way that it could interface with that omnitool?


AUSTIN: Mmhmmm. 


DRE: Umm. I think that’s probably the biggest way. And then it’s just, it- it allows Gardner to pilot in a way that’s a lot more, like, responsI've and like, just more in tune than like a normal joystick, let’s say.


AUSTIN: Okay. So just thinking about it, like, vaguely emotionally. Like what does that- what did having that tool in Gardener’s life change about Gardener’s life. Like, kind of emotional life?


DRE: Hmmm.


AUSTIN: ‘Cause like, the thing I like about this question is that it helps you articulate something. Like, it’s the tool you never knew you needed, y’know, like if this was a painting, it was like “Ohhh this has made me understand something about me that I didn't have the words for, but now I'm looking at this painting and I have this deep resonance with me.” So it’s not just ths utilitarian, it’s the second step.


30:00
DRE: Sure. Ummmmm. I think- I think maybe it’s like- I mean the biggest thing with Gardener is this, like, this tension between wanting to feel useful and fearing that the only way he can be useful is through, like, the physicality and the usefulness of his body.


AUSTIN: Mmmm. 


DRE: And I think maybe having this…… this deeper and almost like weird mental connection with the machine-


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


DRE: -Like has him beginning to wonder if, “Okay maybe there is, like, y’know, if something does happen and my body is no longer, y’know, up to snuff, maybe there is- there is something more to me that I can still offer.”

AUSTIN: Right. That’s good, I like that a lot. Okay uhhh, “If you needed someone’s help in order to perform your art at a crucial time, they have 1 Faith on you.”

Art: I don’t think that’s quite right? I mean- I mean I certainly feel like that could come up in play-


AUSTIN, overlapping: Oh definitely


Art: -But that’s not right now?


AUSTIN: Right. “If you shared your art with another for the purpose of sharing a secret pain you both have, you have 1 Faith on each other.”

Art: Ummmmm, I mean- that could be- that could be anyone really, but that could also be Gig.


AUSTIN: Yeah? 


Art: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: What’s that scene- what’s that look like in your head?


Art: It’s- it’s like, I think it’s like, showing- showing like a prototype or an old piece that’s like “Yeah this is what I made to try to be a constantly On…”
        
OVERLAPPING
                AUSTIN: Mmmmmm.


[KEITH LAUGHS]






Art: “...thing. And this is why it didn’t work.” 


OVERLAPPING
        ART: And it’s- it’s like-


KEITH: Ah man I totally- I totally didn’t see that connection. I’m glad that now I see it. 
Yeah.


AUSTIN: I actually love- I actually love that. 


AUSTIN: Like you’re up late. Gig you’re showing your first videos that you’ve hidden on Space Youtube. Right, that you’ve like, whatever the- whatever like the Cloud is, on the Mesh, you have all these hidden files-


KEITH: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: -that you bring into focus like, you’re still in- you’re still super in like “Hey guys!” mode and like-


[TABLE LAUGHS]


AUSTIN: -it’s the worst, you don’t feel genuine at all, and then Grand Magnificent is able to be like “Yeah, listen, here- here’s my first mech design.” 


Art: Yeaaaahhhh


AUSTIN: Or! Or! I actually do kinda like the notion of it being something you’re still working on?


Art: Yeah. Or like, it’s a design I never finished. It’s like this endless- it’s like I’ve been chasing this idea for- uhhh. Like 10 years. 


AUSTIN [LAUGHS]: Sorry! The chat has captured me. DRE and SYLVIA have gone off and together they’ve said “Hey guys, what’s up! It’s ya boy, Gig. What the Fuck is up gamers? Welcome to my MirageCraft channel. Before we even start, smash that Like button!” And-


[TABLE LAUGHS]


AUSTIN, laughing: It’s really good.
        
Overlapping
ART: I’ve never seen someone on Youtube ask you to like it before it starts


AUSTIN: Oh I have, it’s bad. They’re out there, they’re out there hustling.


KEITH: Oh yeah yeah. 


KEITH: And the amount of Thesaurus.com uses for the ways to say to press the like button is astounding.


AUSTIN: [LAUGHS] They only get like seven deep, that’s the thing. It’s all, smash, or press, or hit, or punch. It’s never ever “depress that like button”


KEITH as SadTuber: “Listen guys, I just wanna- I just wanna ask everybody: depress that like button for me real quick.”


AUSTIN: God.


ART as Eeyore: Or like “Hey guys. It’s Art’s channel. Please. Please depress the like button-”


[AUSTIN and KEITH laugh]


AUSTIN: That’s it. 


ART (as Eeyore): “- and we’re gonna get going.”


AUSTIN: “And we’re gonna get-”  [LAUGHS] “My Eeyore ASMR.” I’d actually, briefly just like to spin back to Gig as “Future Vlogger.” We actually had a long talk about that. And about what-


KEITH: Aw man.


AUSTIN: -does it mean to be a utopian vlogger. And we’ll get into some of it I think in play. But.


KEITH: It took me so long to come up with something that I really connected with, I’m glad that I finally figured it out.


AUSTIN: I love it. I actually love it a lot, because the notion is, and again we’ll seem some more of this in play I think, but what if you weren’t always hustling for like, a Monster Energy drink endorsement? Or a Razor scooter endorsement. Or a Razor mouse endorsement. Or any sort of Razor endor- like [LAUGHS]  [KEITH says “Yeah” several times during this]


KEITH: Like what is it-


AUSTIN: -Razors.com endorsement, like


KEITH: What is it like to be a guy that like maybe doesn’t need more views because more views doesn’t mean anything? Or-


AUSTIN: -Right? Cause your rent is paid for by society- right like no one’s gonna kick you out of your house-


KEITH: Right, yeah

AUSTIN: -you have food, y’know, provided for you. Maybe you’re able to maintain a, a y’know a viewership where you can connect to people on an individual basis


KEITH: Yeah yeah. And then-


AUSTIN: -You don’t have to appeal to the lowest common denominator


Overlapping


KEITH: And then one step beyond that is like-

        ART: Or! Or! Cosmic brain: Everyone’s just always talking about how they lover Razor 
Products


[LAUGHING]


OVERLAPPING
        
        AUSTIN: They never clarify which Razor they mean
        
        KEITH: Have you seen how sharp and dangerous my mouse is???


[LAUGHING]


KEITH: Everytime I play Counter Strike I get three cuts on my hand!


AUSTIN: Counterstrike somehow, 1.6 still the number one game in the future


[LAUGHING]


AUSTIN: 300k years in the future it’s….god


Art: But all casinos are just trading skins, right? Or are just skin lotteries.


AUSTIN: Yep!

KEITH: Aw man


OVERLAPPING
        
        AUSTIN: The um, so, see, okay go ahead
        
KEITH: So what- The other thing is like 


KEITH: One step beyond, one step beyond like “What does it- what does a vlogger look like in a world where you don’t need to get views to make money” but then also what does it mean to want to get more views when the way that you have to act is disconnected from the ways that we think of that you make money on the internet
        
AUSTIN: Right right. And the answer is hopefully something a little more genuine feeling? Um...


KEITH: Yeah. Which-


AUSTIN: My favorite model of this is not a vlogger at all but like. I was watching some Anthony Bourdain interviews last night where it was just like-


KEITH: Yeah


AUSTIN: -he seems genuinely interested in this Korean Sizzler like- [LAUGHS] 


KEITH: Yeah. YeahYeahYeahYeah


AUSTIN: He’s like really interested in this Sizzler so.... [DRE LAUGHS] That’s um-


KEITH: He likes Sizzler! He likes cooking stuff and he likes talking about it


AUSTIN: Right. So okay-


KEITH: Ummm


AUSTIN: -back to Art though. Is that it actually? Did we get all your stuff, Art?


Art: Yeah I think that the- the last scary question I’m willing to take it with...with Gig


AUSTIN: Yeah sure, both!


KEITH: Sure. Do I owe you or do you owe me?

Art: We both have it with each other


AUSTIN: That’s really good


KEITH: Oh, that’s fun.


Art: It’s a mutual- we both- we’re both embarrassed...together


KEITH: Did we talk about the stream suppressor? Is that something we wanna bring up now or later?


AUSTIN: We’ll- we can bring that up once we’re in play. I think it’ll come up, right? I think that that’s...


KEITH: I’m- Yeah I’m po- yeah


AUSTIN: I mean basically what it means is you have a thing in your brain that says this is what lets you stream but also one of your emotions is, like, less available to you basically?


KEITH: Yeah yeah there’s like a list of stuff like that this thing takes away from you. One of them is like “the memory of a loved one” 


AUSTIN: Which you did not take


KEITH: I didn’t take. The one that I thought was- that the most interesting for me was that it suppresses my ability to be sad. Which I think is like I think a tempting offer for someone trying to be “On” all the time and also really bad for if you’re playing a game where you need to roll based on how sad you are.


AUSTIN: Right. Yep! That’ll be fun. Let’s go to Dre! Even Gardner


DRE: Hey!


AUSTIN: Even: What’s your playbook, and then let’s start with your look, and then beliefs


DRE: So Even is The Catablist, and that is basically, um, a person who can integrate technology into their body through the use of a kind of, what they- what the book calls an Omnitool.


AUSTIN: Mmhm.


DRE: So you don’t get cybernetics through traditional means. You use this Omnitool to basically integrate this stuff into your body in a more intense way. Um, Even’s look is masculine. He wears bulky wear. Kind of the touchstones I have for Even’s look are the new Kojima mascot Ludens-


AUSTIN: -Oh yeah so good-


DRE: -and then Destiny titan armor. Just like big, bulky future space shit. He has a smooth face, earnest eyes. He’s older. I don’t know how age works, y’know, on the ships and in the Fleet, but I imagine him to be like- what we would think of as early 50s. And the way I’ve been picturing Even in my head is that he is of Middle Eastern descent.
        
OVERLAPPING
        
        AUSTIN: In the future? In my mind it means- you know it’s like-
        
DRE: I’m not sure what that would mean culturally, you know in a future utopia? But that’s the way I’ve been picturing him


AUSTIN: It’s one of those tough things when I think about race- race and gender both in the future is like: In my vision of the future, there are categories of- there are just different categories for identity, period. Across everything. Socialization is such a huge part of identity that we would have different, y’know, gender identities, different racial and ethnic identities. The world is such a different place. But it is our job to offer representation, and if we cast these shows now with real actors I would kinda want to know who to cast in them. And so I’m glad to know we’d cast a Middle Eastern actor- an actor of Middle Eastern descent for this role. You know that’s kind of what we mean right now? It’s not that I don’t want to deal with race in this game, in fact I think Bluff City might end up dealing with race here and there. You can’t tell a story about Atlantic City without thinking about how Black folks have been fuckin’ cheated out of their land in that city. But it’s- it is also a- it’s hard to build that utopian game that like, here is the place where race- you know identity has been- there is a- it’s tough because you don’t want to say race doesn’t mean anything anymore cause it’s so hard to imagine that world. But at the same time, when you say we want to imagine ourselves a utopia, it is one in which difference is recognized but it’s not like “oh everyone is just white” y’know. But it’s also one in which there is actual lived equality. So that’s what my vision for race is in this world. So there are still different ethnic groups that have ethnic food and history, and all that that is maintained, while also is never secondary. So that’s a really broad answer for a thing, and hopefully we’ll see some of that as we play, but yeah. Y’know, that’s kinda where I am with it.


Art: I have recast this character in my head!


AUSTIN: Okay


Art: As Randall Park!


AUSTIN: I don’t know who that is, is that-


KEITH: I love Randall Park

Art: Me too


KEITH: Ohhh Randall Park is great


AUSTIN: I’m looking up Randall Park- OH Randall Park’s great!


[Art, KEITH, and AUSTIN overlap talking about how Randall Park is great]


DRE: Oh yeah okay


ART: And he has the perfect delI'very for this character. I can’t do that voice of him that well, like I’m not gonna do a good enough job at this. But you at home [AUSTIN: Go look up-] just write down every- all the lines and then go and like see if you can get Randall Park to say them


[DRE laughing in the bg]


AUSTIN: This image of Randall Park on his Wikipedia page is just Grand Magnificent at that party-


ART: Yup. Yeah. Uh-huh!


DRE: [LAUGHS]


AUSTIN: -Like “man I gotta get the fuck out of here.” Just takes off this terrible, like, cream-colored beanie [DRE and KEITH laughing], takes off this garbage scarf and just like “I’m out of here.” Awesome. Good. [trying not to laugh] Good. Good talk


[DRE still laughing]


AUSTIN: Fuckin’...tell me about your beliefs


DRE: Umm, my beliefs are orders from the Fleet have good reasons behind them. The unique oddities we discover on the surface of Quire deserve to be protected and preserved, and Grand Magnificent has made a great contribution [AUSTIN sounds like he’s about to start laughing] to our mission so I should help him find what he seeks.


AUSTIN: Awesome. Uh let’s talk about your Faith questions


DRE: Let’s see. Let me pull those up


AUSTIN: You’ve convinced someone else of your- Actually let’s talk about your ideology really quick cause that’s actually a thing that’s important right


DRE: Yeah so-


AUSTIN: Your book says “Once you may have been like them, one among many. Then something happened to you and you changed. Changed into something unlike anything out there and you became this person because you believe blank. What is the thing you believe?

DRE: So the thing I have written here, and I think I might wanna keep workshopping and honing it, but this is much better than what we had before. “I was saved by fate and I’ve become something entirely new. This second chance means nothing if I don’t embrace my gifts.”


AUSTIN: Okay yeah! I like that a lot. So what was the second chance?


DRE: So kind of the backstory we’ve worked out for Gardener is that Gardener has always been military aboard the Ever-Forward. And part of Ever-Forward, being in the military is that, like, when you discover new places or you go to new places, part of your job is bringing back newly discovered plants and animals and stuff like that to basically continue to preserve and to keep building this big, giant ship-wide zoo they basically have. Returning back from one of those missions, something went bad while Even was flying solo [AUSTIN: Mmhm] and his ship got messed up and he more or less was going to die due to exposure in space, but one of the things that he had brought back on the ship was this- basically this parasite and the way that parasite lives is by combining two different kinds of creatures to basically multiply itself and to keep living. And so this creature basically combined Even with some of the matter in the Twilight Mirage. And became, basically like overrode all of Even’s, like any cybernetic stuff that he had before, that he probably got as being both a member of the Fleet and military, and basically became- Even is no longer just a human with cybernetic enhancements. He’s- he’s something...different. 


OVERLAPPING

        DRE: He’s basically a hybrid with this creature.
AUSTIN: He is this hybrid thing.


AUSTIN: Like he’s part of the Mirage in a weird way right?


DRE: Yeah


AUSTIN: And also part whatever this creature is. Which we’ll figure out and define more as we continue, but like, right now it’s- it’s- I like that a lot. I like this notion that this- It is easy in cyberpunk and sci-fi stories to be like “Oh yeah, and cyborgs. And everyone has a metal arm. And that’s what makes you a cyborg.” [DRE LAUGHS] And like yeah. Okay yes. In the same way that having glasses having a, y’know, a cybernetic enhancement to a human life. But I like this second step that is like “No no no no no, I am this other thing yet still. And how does the world deal with me?” In the world in which everyone is chipped, in the world in which everyone has a brain chip that connects them to the Mesh, how does that work? Like where do you fit in? And where does Echo fit in, who doesn’t have that chip? And then where does, y’know, Gig fit in, who not only has a chip but has a special chip that means that everything that he does can be part of the- I like how all of these characters can have a different relationship with that chip. So. [pause] And Grand who thinks he’s way over the Mesh. 


[TABLE LAUGHS]


ART: Yeah the Mesh is really passé, I think we’re all going to go back to effecting the world with giant robots again soon, and I’m just kinda way ahead of where we are in that.


AUSTIN, still laughing: Okay, good. So your questions. Now that we know that part. Um, let me find them again. Here we go. “If you’ve convinced someone else of your ideology, and they believe it is to their benefit, you have one Faith on them.” Does anyone believe that Hybrids are the way of the future? Or that-


SYLVIA: -Nope! [DRE laughing]


AUSTIN: -Or that overcoming the bounds of humanity. 


DRE: What you’re not into that Echo? That’s not your-


SYLVIA: No. Weirdly enough 


DRE: That’s not your jam? [LAUGHS]


AUSTIN: Okay. Anybody else? My guess is no.


KEITH: No


AUSTIN: Okay. “If someone else helped you develop your Omnitool with or for you they have one Faith on you.”


DRE: Mmmmmm. I do, like I could see this as being a thing where, like, in the process of designing the mech with Grand Magnificent they also figured out a way to make it interact with, y’know, the Omnitool in a certain way?

AUSTIN: Or just like  “Hey you have this thing and you can do X, but now you can do X+Y.” Like now you have this thing that’s like a natural ability, here’s a gauntlet or something that lets you bring it out in a different way.


DRE: Actually you know what we could do- so one of the tags I have on the Omnitool as like part of the mechanical part of building this character is that it does a bonus for when I get like a move later on down the line. So what if we hold that question-


AUSTIN: -Sure


DRE: -and when i do get that move the way we can explain it in story is that like, Grand Magnificent during our downtime was like “Hey have you thought about trying this or-”


AUSTIN: Yeah I like that a lot


DRE: Something like that


AUSTIN: Just make sure we remember that. Make a note somewhere on your notes-


DRE: Sure


AUSTIN: -so that you remember to do that. To give Grand that Faith. Finally, “If you repaired someone else’s cybernetics when they didn’t have the means to do so themselves, you have one Faith on them


DRE: Ummmmm


AUSTIN: That could be anyone except Echo here


DRE: Right


SYLVIA: Yeaaah that doesn’t really work for me there


ART: Yeah um, I do have a lot of important cybernetics if you wanna go that direction


DRE: [Chuckles]


KEITH: I also have a-


ART: -And so does Gig

DRE: Right, yeah


KEITH: Yeah yeah I have an investment in making sure my stuff is working right


OVERLAPPING


DRE: I think that actually-

        AUSTIN, laughing: -Yeah! Like maybe you get down here- 


AUSTIN: Yeah go ahead


DRE: I actually kind of like- kind of- it seems so far that one of the themes of my Faith relationships is that even though Grand Magnificent may not be the most like com- technically competent person when it comes to what we might be doing on this planet, they have like a lot of shit on me. And I kind of like that Faith relationship. So like, if-


AUSTIN: You don’t want it to be more equal


DRE: Right, yeah


AUSTIN: Okay


DRE: So if you’re okay with that, KEITH, I’d like to do that with Gig


KEITH: Sure! Yeah


DRE: Okay


AUSTIN: Cool. So, the group comes down in the Myriad, which is the name of this ship, and also the name of the AI who pilots the ship and the robot who pilots the ship across a kind of- you kind of come north over a group of- of - not even a group but like miles of miles of- hundreds of miles of jungle, and you find a grassy plainland, kind of like a plains grassland? I don’t know how words work. And you touch down in the middle of it. And so you have this- I don’t know, what’s your ship look like? I was gonna describe it but I wanna leave that up to y’all, what’s the actual- What’s the Myriad look like? Sorry, not “The Myriad,” Myriad.


KEITH: Which ship did this ship come from?


AUSTIN: I think that this is Empyrean’s. Who is like this, y’know, I kind of see Emperyan’s style of being a mix of a bunch of other styles, because Seance, the home city of Seance, is literally a graveyard for other Divines. But at its core, lot’s of- Seance is octagonal. I think octagons in general are probably the general style that comes up a lot. I kind of had vaguely Aztec style architecture in my mind, but that’s not a thing I’m firm on necessarily. But also what if there was a cool Space Aztec ship that sounds like it could be cool. Like idk what that is exactly, lots of sharp geometry, y’know, lots of hard angles.


KEITH: Mmhm.


AUSTIN: But also lots of concentric shapes. Maybe? Hmmmm, idk. But anyway, comes down in this grassland, and you are gI'ven your mission, and I think we actually cut to en media res to all of you facing, kind of a group of plateaus and canyons in front of you, because, what you need to do, as I said during character building- in kind of the character introductions segment, you have 3 missions. You have to spread the Mesh further by installing these big nodes. So I think you have these huge, octagonal, metal….device. When I say it’s big I think it’s like the size of a minivan. So you have to tell me how you’re moving it. I don’t know how you’re moving it. I don’t know if you have a beast of burden, idk if you’re dragging it, or what. Idk if it’s on a hovercart. You have to go put that somewhere that has a clear line of the sky, and that is basically a few hundred miles away from this ship. And those are what is going to set up the uplink with the Twilight Mirage satellites that are in orbit, and those are what will provide a map for you, and provide information about the surrounding areas, and what will bring the Twilight Mirage down here, and bring the version of the Mesh that the best of the Fleet is used to here, to this planet, the planet of Quire. The second thing you need to do is bring into the fold and civilizations that are down here. I’m guessing maybe the group of you has, [LAUGHS] not some paperwork, but my suspicion is that you have to get somebody to come back to the ship and do some sort of negotiations, and hopefully make things- or one of you could be in charge of doing that! That could also be the case, to kind of make that negotiation happen and bring somebody into the fold. Or maybe the person who’s back on the ship, one of the people who’s back on the ship is actually an am- not an ambassador but a diplomat of some sort, who has the authority to make those decisions, or to make those deals. I’m not sure, we’ll figure it out. And finally to investigate the rumors of the living, hiding Divine. But to get those last two, the first thing you need is just some connection to the Mesh. Because right now you only have the Mesh inside the ship, basically, and that is not enough to do the whole mission you’re here to do. 

So I think we just open on the group of you with this huge, y’know, 2 ton metal, octagonal, cylindrical node that’s gonna like dig into the ground when it gets where it’s getting on something, carrying it somehow, and you come to basically this group of canyons. Now the flyover revealed that if you just get through this one 100-200 mile bit of canyon, you’ll get through it and go to open skies. But you need to maintain the connection with your main ship in this other grassland in order to do this setup. So you couldn’t just get dropped off there, it has to be a maintained connection. I think when we did this the first time we talked about there being a line to be drilled everyone hundred miles [KEITH: Mmmhm] or something right? That like [DRE: Yeah.] connects it so- it’s like a thin line that goes underground that connects the node to wherever you’re going. Um.


ART: Like a futuristic telephone pole!

AUSTIN: Yeah, exactly. Like just deep underground. Uhhhh. Oc-TAG-anol? Is that what it’s supposed to be Kei-? Is it- Oc-TAG-anol that’s right.

Overlapping:
KEITH: I don’t- I don’t think it’s supposed to be anything. Oc-TAG-anol is what I know it 
Is.

AUSTIN: Oc-TAG-anol is right. Oc-TAG-anol is right.


AUSTIN: I was saying octa-GON-al which is completely wrong. Oc-TAG-anol, Oc-tag-a...bleh


KEITH: It’s a hard word.


ART: Oct-tog- Octa- octa-GON-al


KEITH: Oc-TAG-anol
AUSTIN: Oc-TAG-anol


KEITH: Oc-TAG-anol


AUSTIN: Hmmmm. Yeah Twitter’s gonna have a field day. Uhhhhh.

KEITH: Yeah

DRE: Stop sign looking-


AUSTIN: So yeah you have this thing and you’re going- you’re you kinda facing this this deep canyons of kind of- um you know, kind of a creamy tan and like rose color. For the near future it looks like you could push this thing the way through the path that a river once ran through or something. But tell me how you’re moving it. Like what’s that look like?

DRE: I guess that kind of depends on, like, is this a mission that a lot of the members of the Fleet think is super important and would give us really good gear for? Or is this like a, kinda like “I guess we gotta do this but, like, good luck fuckers” and so we have a crappy old mag-lev?

AUSTIN: [LAUGHS] I’d say that you’re well-rescoursed here. Well-resourced but also still secondary to keeping the Fleet alive and safe, right? 


DRE: Makes sense.  


AUSTIN: So yeah, tell me- You can invent a thing here. I’m not like- I’m just curious aesthetically what this looks like.

Overlapping
DRE: Well what if we have-
        ART: Well how long- are we like just starting or- are we like- are you-


AUSTIN: Let’s go en media res, let’s say you’re in one of these canyons. So you’ve been doing it for- you’re 5 days in.


ART: Alright. I think for like the first day or so Grand Magnificent was like super into it. Was like “We’re out here! This is fun! I’m doing this!” and by this point is like “This sucks!” and is kind of dragging and not openly complaining but it’s kind of like y’know- I don’t know what the adult space version of “Are we there yet?” is but like- Maybe just like-


KEITH: -I think it might be “Are we there yet”


ART: -Checking, yeah, checking a GPS and realizing that that doesn’t work.


AUSTIN [laughing]: Because you haven’t set up the GPS yet, yeah.

DRE: [LAUGHS]


ART: But he’s been doing that for like two and a half days [LAUGHS]


AUSTIN: Mmhm.


SYLVIA: Jesus.


KEITH: I uh- for the big heavy thing, if I were to pick an ideal way to transport a thing, I would pick a sort of- a sort of hover platform that stays in a specific range of like, a thing that we can put in our pockets. So we can leave it somewhere and it will stay next to the thing, or we can carry it and it will follow us automatically.


AUSTIN: Wait, what about a thing that fits in your pockets? What? What? Wait.


KEITH: Like imagine a little- imagine a key fob that you put in your pocket, and the mag-lev that is carrying the big thing stays within a range of that.

Overlapping
        AUSTIN: Oh! Yeah, okay. Sure sure sure. So it is like a mag-lev...right.

        KEITH: So it doesn’t get closer than 5 feet but it can’t get more than 10 feet and it stays 
within there.


DRE: Okay.


AUSTIN: I’m into that, I’m into that. So it’s hovering along, maybe it’s solar powered, or it’s powered by something. I think either it’s solar powered or it has a battery. Right? Because I want there to be this notion of like, you have to do this kind of quick. Probably both right? Probably has a solar powered battery. So like every couple of hours you have to stop and let it soak in the sun at full blast. And has to pull out these huge solar panels to get the energy back. Or like every time that you do the drop- every time, you know, every time you drop the wire deep underground, you kind of like do this huge piston pump down into the soil, or like down into the crust of the earth of Quire to reconnect to this wire that’s going underneath the ground, and in that moment it can recharge or something? In any case, you’ve been doing this for days now and finally you hit a point where you have to make a decision. You can either take this cave system, which like- a very brief reconnaissance of suggests will lead out to the other side, or you can try going up to the top of one of these plateaus. There’s kind of a thin but not all-together untraversable path up to the top and then you could work your way across the top of it and then down once you get to the other side. Both have their downsides. What are you thinking?

KEITH: Ummm-


AUSTIN: Also in both-


KEITH: -I vote up-


AUSTIN: -in both cases you’ll lose connection to Myriad. And to a character whose name I didn’t mention which is, uh, Alekhine. Al, who is the- the kind of expedition overseer. Maybe he’s also here as a diplomat. I think maybe that makes sense. Like he’s diplomat and also overseer. Which explains why he doesn’t just come out into the world. He’s here to not- he doesn’t- he can’t get killed. He’s the one who seals these deals. He’s the one with the authority to be like “Yeah you’re a part of the Fleet again.”

KEITH: Mmhmm. Yeah.


AUSTIN: So he’s named Alekhine Dendaro. And he’s- so he and Myriad are both in the ship back at HQ. And you’ll lose contact to either- to both of them once you make a decision here. Once you go forward from here. Which-


DRE: Um

KEITH: Caves suck because if you stop being able to go forward you have to go backward.


DRE: Do we have an idea of like-


KEITH: -like if something happens.


DRE: -which one would be faster, seemingly?

AUSTIN: I think you’d have to do some research. 


DRE: Sure.


AUSTIN: Which is a thing you can do. But like, yeah, not just from [KEITH: Yeah]- not just [DRE: Yeah] like this.


DRE: I mean going into the cave gets us out of the sun [AUSTIN: Mmhm.] which you made sound pretty hot.


AUSTIN: It’s pretty hot and you’re in a canyon, which means that like you’re able to be in the shade often. If you go up on top of that plateau, it is going to be hooooooooot.
DRE: Yeah. But then, we also don’t have to worry about- if we go underground, we could quickly run out of solar power for this fuckin’ two ton thing we’re carrying so-


AUSTIN: That’s true.

DRE: I think I might be with- with uhhhh- Gig and KEITH that going up sounds preferable to me.


SYLVI: Yeah I think we all agree then cause I was gonna say up.


ART: Yeah I also want to go up.


AUSTIN: Okay.

KEITH: We all wanna go up! [AUSTIN: Everyone wants to go] This is going very smoothly.


ART [LAUGHING]: Wait, why didn’t any of us roll for this?

AUSTIN: I don’t know! [LAUGHS] What were you gonna roll for it?


ART: I- I don’t-


AUSTIN: Did you wanna do some looking around? Some analyzing? What was the thing were you hoping for?

ART: I mean I still don’t think- I don’t think it’s my place to do it, but- [DRE LAUGHS] But like analyze does seem to be the right thing to roll here.


DRE: We could take the time to poke around in the cave a little bit, just to see what’s in there before we- [KEITH: Totally] Or to look at the viability of the path going up on this thing.

ART: Or just to be like “Oh there’s cave monsters, or plateau monsters.” Or-


DRE: Or monster monsters.


AUSTIN: So maybe it’s like- Does it sound like-


ART: Or regular all-purpose monsters. 


AUSTIN: Is like take the- camp out the for the day and investigate this stuff?

SYLVIA: Yeah sure. 


ART: Yeahh
DRE: That’s not a bad plan.


AUSTIN: Alright so who’s going where?

SYLVIA: Ummm [CLEARS THROAT] I’ll go up.


DRE: I’ll check out the cave.

KEITH: I’ll go up.


ART: I’ll guard the mag-lev.


[TABLE LAUGHS]


AUSTIN: That’s fair. That’s totally fair I can do that.


DRE: Yeah somebody’s gotta do that.


KEITH [TABLE LAUGHING IN BACKGROUND]: Hey look! I’m Grand Magnificent. I think that what we should do is we should do some exploring to make sure both sides are safe! You guys do that and I’ll stay here!


SYLVIA: Ohhhh what a fuck.


AUSTIN: That’s so good.


ART: But I mean, Grand Magnificent is using, I guess we didn’t describe the cyberware this time. But Grand Magnificent has a hand that can draw things in hard light and [AUSTIN: Yeah] he does spend that time doodling some cool mechs.


AUSTIN: Good. Great. So.


Overlapping: 
        ART: Better transport options

        KEITH: So you’re moonlighting.


SYLVIA: When they’re walking away, Echo just like throws their jacket and it lands right on his head. And just like “Hold onto that!”

AUSTIN: Good. What’s Echo wearing under the jacket?


SYLVIA: It’s like uh- I described it earlier it’s like a crop top thing.


AUSTIN: Okay. Yes.


SYLVIA: Basically.


AUSTIN: Alright so let’s start with climbing the plateau. Um. I think there’s a point at which, y’know, you’re able to see the pathway that the- that pushing the cart will- or the mag-lev will take. And that will take you a long time. You can also just climb up. Like if you take the path that you would take you with the mag-lev it will take you until nightfall to climb to the top. But you could probably do hand over hand climbing and make it up there, y’know, by late afternoon.


SYLVIA: Ummm I have a move that’ll actually let us get up there if we do hand- without the mag-lev.


AUSTIN: Oh yeah?

SYLVIA: So. Yeah. So um- the Hone move that I took to start is literally called “Parkour.” 


AUSTIN: GOOD


[DRE LAUGHS] 


SYLVIA: Basically “when you use the environment to facilitate your movements through the world, roll.” And what I think what’s basically happening is what you described, is just rock climbing.


AUSTIN: Okay. 


SYLVIA: I’m trying to think of what Echo’s- I think Echo might be-


AUSTIN: Wait, does- does- Is Gig able to keep up with that?

SYLVIA: Probably not.


KEITH: Ummm.

SYLVIA: Echo’s….whatever.


AUSTIN: Damn.


KEITH: No, I don’t think I can keep up with that. I could-


ART: Wow. Echo’s leaving people behind, throwing clothes on people. [TABLE LAUGHS] Echo’s making friends in the first part of this mission.


SYLVIA: Listen! I’m doing my job. I’m gonna go see if there’s any danger up ahead, I’m The Bodyguard. So like- y’know.


AUSTIN: Let’s start- Let’s start-


SYLVIA: It’s fine. Echo doesn’t really think before they do things.


AUSTIN: Let’s start with this parkour thing. What does it look like and how do you feel?

SYLVIA: So I think what it is. I think this is like- The reason I took this is cause Echo- the Tides on Harmony have like a lot of stacked on top of each other buildings. [AUSTIN: Mmmhm]. And since Echo was sort of a material runner there, they’re used to climbing and running around on top of all of these things. It is kind of like traditional rock climbing, but they’re also propelling themselves really f- with their feet a lot.


Overlapping
AUSTIN: Sure. Almost hopping up lots of-

        SYLVIA: So they’re sort of jumping up it- Yeah.


AUSTIN: Okay cool. So how do you feel? How does Echo while feel doing this?


SYLVIA: I think Echo’s honestly a little annoyed that, that they’ve got to go do this. So probably “mad?”

AUSTIN: Okay okay, gI've me a “mad”. 


SYLVIA: That’s a six.


AUSTIN: Oh buddy. That ain’t great.

SYLVIA: So it just doesn’t work I guess. 


AUSTIN: Make sure you mark “mad” also.


SYLVIA: Yep.


DRE: Oh and XP right? We get XP from fails?


AUSTIN: Oh yeah! So mark XP from failing.


SYLVIA: Ayyyy. Already doing the Friends at the Table way. [AUSTIN: Yep] Rolling a six and getting XP.


AUSTIN: Awesome. So I think you just take off actually. I think the thing that happens here is that you take off, and then get lost. Like, you’re able to make it up to the top of this place incredibly quickly, but then, like, you’ve completely gotten yourself turned around. Because you get up there and you’re just like- it’s a bunch of canyons, and you think you’re headed in the right direction- but you’ve completely… You’re just not able to tell. And then you’re like “Oh I’ll come back down” like you’re waiting where you think Gig will show up. And Gig does not show up. Uhh [LAUGHS] and it’s just not- you’re just lost.


SYLVIA: [SIGHS]


AUSTIN: Gig! How are you-


KEITH/Gig: Hey!


AUSTIN: So you just doing the long way around? [SYLVIA LAUGHS]

KEITH: Yeah. 

AUSTIN: Shout out to Jack de Quidt with their great song “The Long Way Around.” [DRE LAUGHS] Classic Friends at the Table uhhhh callback. The um-


ART: We gonna play that now? Is that-


AUSTIN: Yeah just play that here. No don’t do that, don’t do that. You’re able to just get up there but we’ll come back to you, because it sounds like a pretty peaceful trip. Actually, there’s something you need to do right now, now that I think about it. [KEITH: Okay.] You have a move that’s like “At the start of the game, do this thing.” Because-


[Someone snaps]


KEITH: Oh yeah.


SYLVIA: I need to do that too actually.


AUSTIN: You should both do that right now before we forget it again. Let’s start with youuuuu Gig. The Telepresence has a move called “Old Hungers.”

KEITH: Yes.

AUSTIN: At the start of the game, if you do not already have a lead, which you do not, roll 2d6 without adding a state. “On 10+ there is a solid thread on which to pull, connection to try something already known, or starting point revealed. On a 7-9 it comes disjointed, cryptic, or intangible, or vague. On a miss, in addition to whatever the MC does next, the information is alarming or perilous for you or another. Whatever the result, the MC may give this information in as many words as the sum of the dice roll.” So you roll 2d6 without adding a state, but you should still tell me what this feels like once we- once you roll it.


KEITH: Yeah okay.


AUSTIN: And then you’ll mark, you’ll still mark that spike. And then what I’ll say is you should pick one of the three goals that you have [KEITH: Yeah] as the- the thing that you’re trying to get a lead for.


Overlapping: 
AUSTIN: Hey that’s a 7. Okay.


KEITH: Hey it’s a 7, thank god. Yeah not bad.


AUSTIN: So it comes disjointed, cryptic, intangible, or vague.

KEITH: So for the leads, we’ve got, we have: Expanding the Twilight Mirage-


AUSTIN: Yeah


KEITH: We have-


AUSTIN: Finding the theoretical Divine.


KEITH: Right, the theoretical Divine.


AUSTIN: And trying to bring people back into the fold. 

KEITH: Right, yes.


AUSTIN: You don’t know who, you don’t know where they are or what they are or

KEITH: I guess- I guess right now it would be expanding the Twilight Mirage. That seems like the most immediate thing that I’m literally trying to do right now.


AUSTIN: Yeah totally. So I think, y’know I’m supposed to gI've you...I’m supposed to gI've you-


KEITH: I can- my lead can change right? Like my old hunger can-


AUSTIN: Yeahhhh totally. Well I think- Well you’ll keep that lead until you- So the way that this game works, or the way that this class works, this playbook- Is that, in order to broadcast lI've- so you have a move called “The Curiosity of Millions” [KEITH: Yes.] which is when you actually broadcast. You need a story, and in order to have a story, you need the lead, the source, and the facts. In order to get those, you have to do other things basically. So this will give you the lead. Right? So what I think happens here is- I think maybe something in your brain, um, get- like, blasts you a- an image of the- it’s like you end up being tied into a frequency that’s already here. Your stuff is built for the Twilight Mirage but there’s like a derivative signal here that you can’t quite tune into actually. But for a brief moment you’re able to, and you’re able to sense the- you’re able to basically get a map of the area around you. And you can see that there is just to the north of these plateaus, it’s 7 words right? I should count out words really quick. “The old church is an amenable host.”


KEITH: Huhhhh. That is a lead. 


AUSTIN: Yeah! Totally. Uhhhhh. Okay. Let’s go underground. And then you just-


KEITH: I think I was joyful by the way.


AUSTIN: Okay so go ahead and mark “joyful” then. 


KEITH: I think I’m excited to be on the planet, yeah.


AUSTIN: Even though you didn’t roll it. Cause you should always be- even when you’re rolling other stuff, you should be marking whatever that thing is. Oh so yeah. Echo, what is your thing at the top of the game?


SYLVIA: Potential. At the beginning of the session it’s roll 2d6 without adding a state as well. And then I generate “Humanity” depending on the result. [AUSTIN: Go for it] 10+ generates two, 7-9 generates one. And that will let me to do stuff later. 


AUSTIN: It’s kind of like your special ammo basically.


SYLVIA: Yeah. So I got one cause I rolled a 7.


AUSTIN: And what is that move? Thematically, or like materially I guess.


SYLVIA: Materially, it’s basically the result of Echo’s training right? [AUSTIN: Okay] And the lifestyle that they lived. 


AUSTIN: Yeah. So is this just a moment of, before this all starts even, we get Echo doing some stretches and like looking at the rest of the crew and getting ready to go off on their own into the world?


SYLVIA: Yeah, probably.


AUSTIN: How do you feel about that?

SYLVIA: Uhhhh. It’s a bittersweet feeling I’d say? Echo’s really excited to be on Quire, they’re excited to be somewhere that is- They’re excited to be on a planet for the first time in their life. And it is so different than everywhere they’ve been and it’s so alI've in a way that they haven’t really experienced. But at the same time they’re here as punishment and that’s always in the back of their mind.


AUSTIN: Right. That- I think that could be “sad” or “joyful” or even “peaceful?” I could see any of those. You tell me which one you think and mark it.

SYLVIA: I think I’ll mark “peaceful” for that. Cause it’s kind of a mix of the two.


AUSTIN: Yeah totally. Y’know like some other good ones, there’s a wheel that has a bunch of different emotions on it that helps you map things. And it’s not- it’s not dogma in any way. But like “pensive” is in there, but so is “sentimental.” And like- I think that those two are kind of like, eh “bittersweet.” Somewhere in there. Y’know?

SYLVIA: Yeah


AUSTIN: Alright cool. Sooo underground. Even. You are- you walk into this cave system, and at first it makes- it’s like okay yeah this is just a regular ass cave system. What are you doing to explore? What’s this look like? How deep in are you going, what sort of tools do you have?


DRE: I’m trying to look at my- the stuff that I have here. So like, I don’t have like a weapon knife, but I feel like I probably have some sort of utility knife or something


AUSTIN: Yeah sure sure


DRE: And so I think I’m making like, little signs and stuff, chipping stuff out of the walls or stuff like that to kinda mark where I’ve come from and if I’ve gone down certain branching paths or something


AUSTIN: Sure. Yeah you’re able to do that stuff. And do you have, like, lighting? Do you have night vision? What’s your- what’s your optics situation? Cause it gets dark pretty quick


DRE: Ummmm yeah. I don’t have night vision or anything so I guess I just have some kind of flashlight. It’s probably like a really good fucking flashlight


AUSTIN: What if it’s, like, built into your shoulders?

DRE: Yeah


AUSTIN: Like what if you just had lights you can turn on that are like driving lights. I keep picturing you as a tank, do you know what I mean? Like a big-


DRE: Mmhm. No that’s a good- yeah, yeah that’s good


AUSTIN: Alright, so yeah, that stuff comes on and you’re able to- to make up the basic gist of the place. I’d say that you do have to do some more in-depth research to find any extra information here, but like your first blush is like “Okay it’ll be dark.” And maybe a little damp the further you go in? Uh but you have to do some deeper research to get more

DRE: That’s weird. I guess like I- you saying it’s damp the further you go in is interesting. So I guess I kind of, like, take some of the- like I’m imagining I’m having my hand on the wall, and I’m kind of tracing along the wall, and I feel it get wet and I kind of rub it between my fingers and take a look. Like is it just water or is it something weird and gooey or?


AUSTIN: [SIGHS] It’s...So at first it’s just water, it’s just like y’know, humidity, or like condensation or something. But then you actually notice that there’s plant life, there’s like a lichen or something on the wall. There’s like a- there’s some sort of mossy, very thing something down this way


DRE: Okay. Um. I mean, Even is from a ship that’s like full of categorizing plant life- 


AUSTIN: -Yes


DRE: So I wonder if like he kneels down by it and is kind of muttering to himself about a fuckin biology class he took like 3 years ago [ART LAUGHS] and is like “Okay this looks kind of like this cell structure” and um- I guess just trying to rack his brain and to see if he remembers seeing anything like this before


AUSTIN: I’m gonna say no, but you should go ahead and- Well so 2 things are happening here. You could be lifting The Veil, which is “You’re trying to pierce the constant illusion of The Veil, search for information or recall something you may have already been privy to. Roll.” or you’re analyzing, which is “when you use what you have at your disposal to assess a place or situation, roll.” So are you trying to learn more about this stuff, or are you trying to figure out the situation? It feels like stuff


DRE: Yeah I think it’s stuff


AUSTIN: Alright so go ahead and lift The Veil. Give me a roll, tell me how you feel


DRE: Okay. Ummm, I guess “peaceful”


AUSTIN: Yeah that sounds right


DRE: I mean this is like- this is just curiosity


AUSTIN: Yeah, go ahead and give it to me. Okay, 9. [DRE: That’s a 9] So on a 7-9 I will give you an impression. Um, the thing that you know right away is that the stuff- so I think that this is a unique breed of wall algae, basically. It lives on water and on- it’s able to live on a very light phosphorescent light. It doesn’t need much light. And I think maybe at that moment you’re able to be like “Oh.” and turn off your flashlights and deep down in here there is a very soft blue glow coming from deeper into the cave that is able to reflect and refract back up to here that you can now see even with your flashlights off.


DRE: Hmmm


AUSTIN: I’m trying to think, is there anything else about this stuff. [PAUSES] I think that’s it for a 7-9, yeah


DRE: Yeah for a 7-9. Ummm I do have like a sleeve communicator, like if I try to radio back to Grand Magnificent can I get through to him?

AUSTIN: Yeah at this point you totally can


DRE: Okay. I guess I radio back that I’ve found this weird lichen glowing situation and that I’m gonna keep pushing on to see if it would be safe to continue going


GRAND MAGNIFICENT: Copy that! And then writes down “werewolf glow”


[TABLE LAUGHS]


AUSTIN: [LAUGHS] Good. Good. Ummm, you push a little further, and then what I’ll give you is that you’re able to- because your lights are off- like your lights had been blinding you to this stuff in a sense before. Like your flashlights were a high-powered beam that were covering up this soft blue glow. But you’re able to find a little pathway that goes off to the right that you would’ve missed otherwise. And then again it’s big enough for that Mag-Lev to push through, and then there’s a hole in the ground. And you look through the hole in the ground and it’s this huge bright blue city. It’s- no one’s moving, it’s like- City’s probably the wrong word, right. It’s suburban. It’s the tallest building down, it’s like 3 stories, 4 stories down that you’d have to like rope your way down. But you look down and it’s just this old abandoned city covered in this blue glow-y lichen


DRE: And you said nobody’s moving? Like I don’t see people down there?


AUSTIN: There’s no people down there as far as you can see from here with no roll


DRE: Well yeah I guess I would like, yell out.


AUSTIN: Yeah nothing responds to you


EVEN: Hellooo!


AUSTIN: Yeah your voice echos, you can tell from the sound of the echo that it’s like- I don’t know how pro you are at listening to echoes- Like there’s water down there, like there’s probably a lake or something down there. And then- but also it’s not that that big. Like it’s not a whole other world down there, it’s just- it’s kind of like there’s an enclosed underground little city


DRE: Okay. Me as a person wants to go check out this city, ummm but I think the soldier Even is like “Okay if we’re gonna check this thing out I need to regroup.” 


AUSTIN: Yep. Sounds good


DRE: So I think I head back to the entrance


AUSTIN: Cool. So, um, Gig


KEITH: Hey!


AUSTIN: You are [KEITH: Yeah.] You are- uhh you make it [KEITH: I am] on top of this place! You make it on top of the plateau, and it’s night time, and you have a good idea of where you are and you’re like “Ah that was nice hike” but it wasn’t the most exhAUSTINg thing ever


KEITH: Right


AUSTIN: And you just- you can kind of pretty easily see the following things: From the- from the, you’re at the southern end of a plateau that is kind of- again, kind of round- actually maybe this one is kind of oblong that leads out right to where you can see that there is flat desert to the north. It’s far, like you can’t- you can’t look straight down and see it because it’s, y’know, probably another day, 2 days walk on the top of this plateau where you suspect it will be very hot 


KEITH: Yeah


AUSTIN: And it’s night time now. And then waaaaaaayyyy waaay off to the west there’s like a glimmer of light, and then way off to the east there’s a another glimmer of light. And the one off to the east-


KEITH: Sorry what was the first one? Before the two glimmers


AUSTIN: It’s- You’re at the southern end of an oblong plateau that goes [KEITH: Okay] north-south, so you’re at the southern [KEITH: Got it] end of it and if you just get to the north end you’ll be able to come down on the other side [KEITH: Got it] and that will get you to the big open area where you think you can place this node. [KEITH: Okay] But it’s probably a couple days walk from here. [KEITH: Got it] You also see off in the distance towards the north, probably a 5 hour, 6 hour walk from here at normal pace, uhhh a campfire and like the light of- not just a campfire but a big bonfire with like some equipment maybe? Like it’s odd silhouettes way off in the distance. [KEITH: Okay] Maybe a 3 hour walk from here but it’s a flat plane so you can see the light. [KEITH: Hm] And you’re able to kind of do whatever you want at this point. And also still have radio contact. Echo you’ve lost radio contact. You think you’re in a different canyon now?

KEITH: Oh so like Echo’s lost lost


AUSTIN: Echo is lost lost


KEITH: I have a lost radio contact


AUSTIN: Yeah. But you could contact Grand from here safely


KEITH: Okay. I’m gonna contact Grand and- and let him know what I can see and also let him know that I lost- No, I’m gonna say that Echo lost themself.


[SYLVIA SNORTS]


ART/GRAND MAGNIFICENT: Alright. Apparently there’s lycanthropes in the caves though so- 


[DRE LAUGHS]


Gig: Lyc- there’s werewolves in the caves?


GRAND MAGNIFICENT: Light-up werewolves is what I think Even said was in the caves so [AUSTIN LAUGHS] I mean I think we’re gonna go where you are but I mean- [AUSTIN SIGHS] but I mean play it cool I don’t- y’know


OVERLAPPING
        AUSTIN: Grand what do-
        KEITH: Should I like-


AUSTIN: Go ahead


Gig: Should I go try and find Echo? Or should I go about this fire place?


GRAND MAGNIFICENT: I mean I have this book on orienteering that says if you’re lost in the woods never- like don’t keep going wait for someone to find you. I think you’re both qualified for that at this point, I think you should both wait


[AUSTIN LAUGHS]


Gig: Well I’m not lost, I know exactly where I am


GRAND MAGNIFICENT: Oh well then you should- you should not- you should also let Echo come back to you

Gig: I think you’re misinterpreting this book. It sounds like, from the advice that the book is giving you, it sounds like I should go and find Echo


GRAND MAGNIFICENT: Alright but make sure you don’t get lost. Like, don’t- don’t uh-


OVERLAPPING


Gig: Yeah no I- Got it- There’s no trail

        GRAND MAGNIFICENT: Don’t stray from the trail- And if you stray from the trail, don’t 
use direction markers that you don’t know for a fact are absolute


Gig: Got it, okay.


GRAND MAGNIFICENT: And I don’t know if this is true anywhere but on Earth, but the moss grows on the north side of the tree


Gig: Moss grows on the north side of the tree. What about lichen?

GRAND MAGNIFICENT: Well they need the full moon but I don’t know how that affects the cave


[LAUGHING]


AUSTIN: How many moons are there on this planet? I hadn’t thought about that


ART: How big a planet is it?


AUSTIN: Um, I think it’s Earth sized. Maybe it’s a [ART: Alright] little bit- actually it’s a little bit- I know exactly how big it is because I generated this planet. It’s a little bit smaller than Earth


ART: I mean then 1-2 I think. Cause that’s how you get a moon, right?

AUSTIN: Yeah


ART: It’s your gravity? Cause that’s why Jupiter’s got all them moons


AUSTIN: Yeah it’s probably- what if it’s what if it’s 2


KEITH: What if it’s 2?


AUSTIN: No! No. This is- this is- there are 5 moons


ART: Okay

KEITH: Are any of them super close?

AUSTIN: Yeah one of them is, one of them’s super close


KEITH: One of them is super close


AUSTIN: Like a fuckin-


ART: Does that mean it’s also super big? Or does that mean it’s smaller?

AUSTIN: Wait why would it be smaller?

ART: How does gravity work? Well cause it’s- if it’s super big and it’s closer wouldn’t the gravity of the planet threaten to crash into the ground?

KEITH: They would rotate around each other


AUSTIN: I think what KEITH means is “What if it’s super big like lookin’?” What if it looks super big

[NOISES OF UNDERSTANDING]


AUSTIN: We are in that season


KEITH: I didn’t mean physically close


AUSTIN: Okay yes


KEITH: Yeah


AUSTIN: Yes to both of those things


KEITH: Okay


AUSTIN: This is our most extra season. This is our most anime bullshit season. Um, yes there is a second moon, or yes there is a large moon, and I think there are 5 moons. Which yeah, that’s weird. Okay


KEITH: Yeah


AUSTIN: Cool


KEITH: Ummm, you really knew 5. That’s weird


AUSTIN: Ah it could be 4, I’m not tied to 5. [KEITH: Okay okay you’re not tied to 5] But 5 is enough where you should be like “Hrmm raising an eyebrow”


OVERLAPPING


KEITH: Hrmm. Ooh what’s goin’ on here?

        AUSTIN: That’s a lot of moons


KEITH/Gig: Alright well thanks for the advice!


ART: Maybe there’s some sort of moon creature on this planet. It makes moons!


[LAUGHING]


AUSTIN: Fuck! Gotta throw out some prep. God. No, okay. So what are you doing Echo? Or not Echo sorry, uhhhhhhh Gig. Are you going after Echo?

KEITH: Yeah I’m gonna go- I’m gonna try and find my friend that got lost


AUSTIN: Okay. How are you doing that?


OVERLAPPING
        AUSTIN: And Echo are you doing anything to help?


        KEITH: I take out my eye


AUSTIN: You- excuse me?


KEITH: I have an eye that I can take out of my head

SYLVIA [WHISPERING]: Fuckin’ what


AUSTIN: No


KEITH: I have an eye I can take out of my head, and it’s a robot eye and I- it- I can like look 2 places at once. Because my eyes can be in 2 different places


ART: Oh my god everyone don’t think about what this must look like


AUSTIN: Yeah. We never show it on screen. That’s cool huh. We never show this on screen


SYLVIA: I love it


[DRE LAUGHING]


AUSTIN: Oh my god


KEITH: I call- it is- So I have a detachable remote cybernetic eye


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


KEITH: Uh, it has magnification ability and it has a negatI've tag, which is “Twitchy”


AUSTIN: Okay

ART: Does it move? Does it have like legs?

AUSTIN: It says it’s remote

KEITH: No it kind of floats, kind of like-


AUSTIN: Is it like anti-mag-lev, is it also weird mag-lev technology


KEITH: It’s small, maybe it’s just filled with helium


AUSTIN: No. Nope


SYLVIA, LAUGHING: No


KEITH: No?


AUSTIN: No


ART: Does he just have a dirigible eye?


[LAUGHING]


AUSTIN: No. No. We’re not in Marielda anymore okay


[KEITH says something unintelligible in the background about the eye]


AUSTIN: Does this have-


KEITH: There’s helium in space!


AUSTIN: Does it have like little jets? Does it [pshh pshh] [jet noise]


KEITH: Yeah, yeah sure. It’s a little orb. It’s a little flying like [pshh pshh]


AUSTIN: Yeah, and it’s twitchy-


ART: But like- but like space jets where it’s like air instead of fire? Cause it’s really light it doesn’t need little flame


OVERLAPPING


        AUSTIN: Yeah- it’s incredibly light- Okay that’s our science
        
KEITH: Yeah yeah it doesn’t need- it’s incredibly light- It’s very light


KEITH: It’s my eye guy


AUSTIN: So are you just flying around and looking for him? Sorry, for them?


KEITH: Yeah! I think I’m walking around- I’m walking around and my eye is flying around in different spots. And we are looking for them


AUSTIN: Alright. Echo, are you helping in any way? What are you do- are you trying to get found at this point? Or are you like “I got it”


SYLVIA: Yeahhh. I think Echo’s like [SIGHS] So the thing is Echo is mostly just like “God if Gig gets himself killed out there I’m gonna be in trouble”


AUSTIN: Okay


[DRE LAUGHING]


AUSTIN: Alright


SYLVIA: Cause like Echo’s whole thing is they just think that like none of these- other than, like, Gardener, half of these people can’t take care of themselves


AUSTIN: Yeah yeah totally. Alright so then let’s start with, it sounds like you’re doing Analyze to me, KEITH, and if you need it, Echo can roll Help to help you [KEITH: Okay!] to help you find them


KEITH: Mmhm- Ummm


AUSTIN: How are you feeling about this situation?

KEITH: Oh I think this is exciting


AUSTIN: Okay. So-


KEITH: I’m still enthralled with the like, being on a new thing feeling


AUSTIN: Okay yeah. Go ahead and mark “joyfull”

KEITH: 11!


AUSTIN: That’s a good ass roll, okay! 


KEITH: Yeah


AUSTIN: When you have you- what you have- bleh bleh- “When you use what you have at your disposal to assess a place or situation, roll. On a 10+ ask 3, on a 7-9 ask 2. When you act on the answers given to you by the MC, take +1 forward.” “Where is my best way in/way out/way past? How is blank vulnerable to me? Which enemy is my biggest threat? What, if anything, appears out of place? What’s my enemy’s true position And is this going to get worse before it gets better?” Um
KEITH: Can I- I can’t ask instead of enemy’s true position, like where is Echo’s true position?


AUSTIN: I think “What if anything appears out of place?” Echo, Echo’s out of place and they are over there


KEITH: Echo’s out of place


AUSTIN: Yeah


KEITH: Okay


AUSTIN: So yeah you can totally find Echo. Echo, where are you?

SYLVIA: I think Echo’s just trying to like find the highest point they can to just look around?


AUSTIN: So you’re climbing a tower to add a map


SYLVIA: Basically. Yeah we’re going full Ubisoft here


[DRE LAUGHING]


AUSTIN: Just wait!

SYLVIA: And they’re just- They’re kinda just like hanging out honestly at this point. They’re just like “Well I’m up here. I can see pretty much everything [ART LAUGHS] around me. I might as well just look out and hope that he comes in my eyesight soon.[AUSTIN: Okay]  And if not, well I’ll just sleep here and find him tomorrow


AUSTIN: So not only does he come into your eyesight, but a little flying eyeball shows up right in front of you


SYLVIA: Jesus


AUSTIN: I imagine that you’re perched on top of like a tall, spindly rock


SYLVIA: Yeah


AUSTIN: And then there’s just Gig’s eye is right there. Does the eye talk? [SYLVI makes a noise of disgust] The eye can’t talk right?


KEITH: No no the eye can’t talk


AUSTIN: Okay


KEITH: But it can blink two times


[AUSTIN sounds distressed]


SYLVIA: I feel like-


ART: It could probably learn Morse Code 


SYLVIA: Gig has shown this off before right? KEITH?


KEITH: I- No


SYLVIA: No? This is completely new?


AUSTIN, far from the mic: Great


SYLVIA: Alright so-


KEITH: I’m sure that- No I’m sure that I’ve talked about it before. I’m that I was like “Y’know what if somebody sees a little floating eye down on the planet and I haven’t mentioned something, someone might step on it”


AUSTIN: Great


ECHO: Hhh that is way grosser than he talked about huh. (SYLVIA: Is like Echo’s immediate response to it). Ehh, alright so do I follow the- how do you- how do you talk to an eye? (SYVLIA: They literally say that outloud. They’re like how do you talk to an eye? [LAUGHS])


KEITH: So what I would do, what I think I would do is, you know like a “come here” motion with your hand? 


OVERLAPPING


        KEITH: The eye would do that with its entire eyeball body


        DRE: Just with its entire eye!


        [SYLVIA LAUGHING]
        
        [AUSTIN GROANING]


AUSTIN: Mrrr. That was my sound of an eye making a come here motion
[ART LAUGHS in distress?]


ECHO, uncomfortable: Sure alright okay yeah great. Lead the way buddy


AUSTIN: Christ. Um


[SYLVIA says something unintelligible]


KEITH: Right. I think the eye is bee-boppin’ around, [AUSTIN: Yeah] having a blast. [AUSTIN: Totally] Flying around having fun 


AUSTIN: I imagine like, it’s twitchy right? So I think like every once in a while one of the jets just sputters out but like it-


KEITH: Yeah it kinda like falls a- it like drops a foot or two real quick


AUSTIN: But like bops. It totally- it does like a rise and fall bop motion thing. It’s great. Alright so-


KEITH: Yeah. But it has- but then it has like a “it’s no problem, listen to my happy little servos”


AUSTIN: Right, exactly. So what are your other two questions here?


KEITH: So what’s my best way, uh, what’s my best way I guess pas- like- yeah


AUSTIN: Yeah, past is fine. So I think you can, there is like, maybe on your way back your eye notices that there is a safe route that would fit the Mag-Lev, that would be on a slightly lower level on the outside lip of the top of the plateau [KEITH: Yeah] but that would be- would mean that you would not be seen by whatever that bonfire group was out ahead.


KEITH: Right. Um. Is this going to get worse before it gets better?

AUSTIN: Ummm [pauses] yes. It depends on what “this” means, right? Yes because now you have to move the Mag-Lev all this way [KEITH: Yeah] and that’s a pain in the ass. Two, you get the distinct impression that group is going to cause violence. Um, and whatever that means is going to make your lI'ves harder. [KEITH: Yeah] And I think that you get that because your eye, in searching for Echo, like picks up the heat signatures, you just see these brief flares of plasma energy get registered. [KEITH: Hmm] They’re not shots, but they’re like- it’s almost as like the revving of a motorcycle. Something similar to that. 


KEITH: Okay


AUSTIN: Alright. Heyyy Grand. 


ART: Yeah hi


AUSTIN: What have you been up to? I’d say this is probably before the group kind of reconvenes. Tell me about your day


ART: I mean it started off designing what a new traveling thing that would do better in this terrain would be. [AUSTIN: Okay] And it’s probably been the last ten minutes or so designing a giant- a giant-scale wolfman that you could pilot if you wanted to like, be in a, y’know [AUSTIN: Uh-huh] Godzilla movie or something. [AUSTIN: Right] Like it’s probably not great work, it- it’s- it looks great, I don’t wanna- 


OVERLAPPING
ART: I wanna tell you that it’s a good looking giant wolfman


AUSTIN, laughing: But it’s mostly- but mostly it’s a sketch and not a-


KEITH: You’ve come up with an impractical solution


ART: Yeah, it’s not-


KEITH: But a- a gorgeous one


ART: It’s a vanity piece it’s not a…


KEITH: Yeah

AUSTIN: Mmhm


ART: It’s a Ferrari, it’s not a pick-up truck


AUSTIN: Gotcha. Alright yeah, so it’s not like a- there’s probably no roll here, right? You’re not actually- this is not a-


ART: I’m not actually making something here


AUSTIN: Notion, yeah. You said briefly you had an idea for a thing but it sounds like maybe you didn’t actually?


ART: Oh yeah, it’s not appropriate. I have a move that I think is like- I have a move about exploring a place that you’re not familiar with [AUSTIN: Okay] but re-reading it, it doesn’t apply here


AUSTIN: Hmmm okay


ART: Because it’s about- it’s about like, what do you see because you’re so- you’re like- cause you’re plugged into society because you’re an artist. This is like, you can go to an out-of-the-way place and fit in. We’re in the wilderness, there’s literally no one here


AUSTIN: I still think you could make this. So this is “Whenever you’re in an area away from society’s norm you haven’t gone to before in order to find something or someone deliberately hidden, describe what it is you follow that others could not or would not see, hear, smell, and then roll. On a 10+ you find yourself where you need to be, on a 7-9 the MC chooses two of the following in order to make your way there first. You must prove you belong here first, there is a code or procedure you need to figure out first, there is danger along the way, someone you wouldn’t want to know where you are now does.” And it depends what you’re looking for. Like if you did want to be looking for something here I would totally let you use that in the wilderness. You might say no right now but know that that’s a thing I would let you do


ART: Alright I think it’s no right now, although like I really love the picture of [AUSTIN: Yeah] Grand Magnificent sketching this giant wolfman and then being like “Hey what’s that?” [AUSTIN: Yes!] and then being like a marking or a [AUSTIN: Totally] hidden sign. Yeah let’s do that, I like that image enough to do it


AUSTIN: Cool. So how do you feel while doing it?

ART: Ummm, I mean I probably fe- let me look at the feeling wheel real quick. Cause the feeling is the like, y’know, what does one feel like when modeling a giant wolfman?

AUSTIN, laughing: “Joy”


ART: Yeah “joy,” um-


AUSTIN: I mean it could- Or “peace.” I don’t know


ART: It might be- it’s probably somewhere in the peaceful center. Probably “serene” or “thoughtful-”


AUSTIN: -Yeah go for “peaceful” that sounds right-


ART: -Or pensive.


AUSTIN: Yeah


ART: “Peaceful” and I’m going to roll it and I’m going to check one box under “peaceful” and-


OVERLAPPING
        AUSTIN: [clicks teeth] and you’re going to fail this roll
        
        ART: And we’ll see what I roll


AUSTIN: Okay mark- also mark XP


ART: Great


AUSTIN: [LAUGHS] Oh boy. Okay so, what’s the thing that catches your eye? Is it a marking on the wall?


ART: Yeah maybe it’s like, uh, something that looks like a shadow and then the shadow moved and then it’s like “Oh that wasn’t-” [AUSTIN: That wasn’t a shadow] “That’s not a shadow that’s a line”

AUSTIN: Yeah. What’s the- so you chase it because you think it’s inspiration or- what do you chase it for? You’re just curious?

ART: I think it’s just cause- yeah I wanna see- I wanna see who did this. This must be a sign. [AUSTIN: Yeah] We’re looking for a way through. If there’s a marking here, it might be pointing towards something


AUSTIN: Yeah. So I think this is happening at sunset. And the sun is like- y’know the shadows are all very long. And it takes you down a few side...alleys in this canyon. Where little cracks of- little rivulets have broken through. And eventually you see the shadow on the wall. And there’s these like two humanoid figures. And one of them has a ball, and is like dribbling the ball. And then it drops the ball-


[OUTRO MUSIC STARTS PLAYING]


AUSTIN: -and the shadow like fades down into the shadow on the ground. And then both figures turn and look at you. And they’re not- there’s no face, there’s no body. There’s just shadows on the wall. They look like- they look like the shadows of people who have been killed by a nuclear explosion, right. You know what I’m talking about?


OVERLAPPING
        
        ART: I do yeah, that’s chilling


        AUSTIN: When they’ve like- But they’re moving


AUSTIN: And for the briefest moment, it looks like the ground itself begins to push out the side of the canyon wall at you. 


[ART makes a noise of awe?]


AUSTIN: And then the sun drops just beyond the canyon and there’s not enough light for shadow to be cast anymore. And it recedes
