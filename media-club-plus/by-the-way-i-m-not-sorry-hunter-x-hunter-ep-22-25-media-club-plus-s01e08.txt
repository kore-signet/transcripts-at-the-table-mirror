[“The Boy in Green” by Jack de Quidt plays]
Keith: Welcome to Media Club Plus, a podcast about diving into the media that interests us and the stories that excite us. As always, we are brought to you by Friends at the Table. This season, we are watching 2011’s Hunter x Hunter, based on the manga by Yoshihiro Togashi. My name is Keith J. Carberry you can find me on Twitter and Cohost @KeithJCarberry. You can find the let’s plays that I do at youtube.com/runbutton. Uh, you can find Friends at the Table at friendsatthetable.cash, that’s our Patreon. Also, twitch.tv/friendsatthetable and youtube.com/friendsatthetable and friendsatthetable.shop. We’ve got a new merch storefront with new Friends at the Table-related merch up there that you can check out. With me as always is Jack de Quidt. 
Jack: Hello. You can find me on Cohost @jdq and you can get any of the music on the show at notquitereal.bandcamp.com. 
Keith: Sylvi Bullet. 
Sylvia: Hi. I’m Sylvia. You can find me anywhere @SYLVIBULLET. Also, because this—we’re recording this like, months or two in advance, go to emoboyskissing.bandcamp.com. My band’s there. 
Ali: [softly] Yeahhhhhh. 
Keith: That’ll be—is there—there’s nothing there now you’re saying, this will be—
Sylvia: [cross] There’s nothing there now, [Keith: Okay.] but we like, we’re, we’re in the process of recording things. 
Keith: All right. Yeah this is so long from now that this’ll be up. Um…
Sylvia: [cross] Yeah. I love that, honestly. 
Keith: [cross] I wanna say four months? [laughs]
Sylvia: Fuck yeah. I love that. That’s—there’s so much less pressure knowing people won’t hear this for ages. 
Ali: [snorts] 
Keith: I will say that there is a unique kind of pressure to having almost half a year’s worth of recording on my drive.
Sylvia: Fair.
Dre: Sure. 
Keith: That I just can’t lose 
Sylvia: [cross] That I just can’t talk and send it to you—
Keith: [cross] It’s just like oh, nothing can happen to this or we’re fucked, we’re just totally fucked. 
Sylvia: [laughs]
Ali: Uh-huh. Yeah. 
Sylvia: Upload it to the drive! 
Keith: Yeah, I’ll put backups on the drive or something. Uh, Andrew Lee Swan. 
Dre: Hey uh, you can find me on Twitter @swandre3000 and I guess, since you’ll be hearing it months from when we’re recording it, it’s safe to plug friendsatthetable.shop.
Keith: Oh, yeah yeah yeah. Oh I just went for it. I just said that. 
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: Oh, okay. I was too busy—while you were talking, the ice cream truck was happening and I was way more interested in that. I’m sorry. 
Sylvia: You were, you’re tripping on that, yeah. 
Keith: Do you need to go get a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle gumball eyes?
Dre: No, I just, it was scary noise. 
Keith: Okay.
Sylvia: Can you get me a Sonic the Hedgehog gumball eyes?
Ali: [cross] Do you not have those? 
Dre: No they do, it’s just, it was like—
Ali: It was loud. It was right out there. 
Dre: [cross] It was, and like coming through like voiceover IP, the noise was like distorted so it sounded like, oh it’s the creepy horror music version of an ice cream truck.
Sylvia: [cross] You thought it was like a Five Nights at Freddy’s situation. 
Dre: Exactly. 
Ali: Ohhhhh. 
Sylvia: Yeah, you thought Freddy Fazbear was here. 
Keith: And today, special manga consultant, [Sylvia and Dre laugh] Ali Acampora, hi. 
Ali: Hi. Hello. I have a question to start. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Ali: We don’t clap on this show? 
Sylvia: It’s fucked, right? Thank you!
Ali: [continuous laughter]
Keith: If it makes you feel better, we can clap. Do we wanna do a 3, 2, 1 clap? 
Dre: It’s very fucked up, you’re right Ali and you should say it. 
Ali: Do you—you don’t just want one just in case?
Keith: Just in case what? I don’t know—just in case—if—if—
Jack: [cross] We tried this—we tried talking him into this and—
Sylvia: [cross] Keith is a twisted fucker. 
Jack: —And what happens Ali is when we say this, and I’m so glad you get to experience this, he says it like this, he says, “Well, we can do a clap for you.” 
Everyone: [laughter]
Sylvia: It’s—
Keith: If we get to a point—
Dre: It’s with so much disdain, too. 
Sylvia: It’s not even disdain, it’s like, it’s like when like, uh, a—a kid hands you like a teacup and tells you to drink it when there’s nothing in it. It’s like that’s what—we’re the kid. 
Jack: [indignantly] He’s handing us a controller that’s not connected to anything! 
Ali: [continuous laughter] 
Sylvia: Yeah, no, absolutely. [laughs]
Keith: I’m trying to imagine a scenario where we would—where something would happen and we need a clap and even still have an episode to put out. 
Ali: It just makes—it just makes it easier, doesn’t it? Even if you have a backup?
Keith: No. I mean—
Sylvia: [continuous laughter]
Ali: Let’s just do one. 
Keith: Okay.
Ali: But I just wanna do it. Can we do one? 
Keith: [cross] We can do it. 
Ali: [cross] Can we do a 3-2-1? 
Keith: Here. Three. Two. One. 
Everyone: [claps] 
Ali: Great. Thank you. Thank you for that. 
Keith: You’re welcome. 
Ali: Hi everybody. 
Sylvi: That’s just gonna be in the—that whole bit’s not getting cut, [Ali laughs] I can feel it. 
Keith. You never know. We’ll see how—we’ll see how I feel. [Everyone laughs] We’ll see how it plays. Ali, did you have a plug, or did you just wanna…backseat produce?
Ali: [cross] You know, you can find me around, on the Internet. Um… [Dre: Wo-ow.] I’m—I—I have social—I’m over on ali_west on twitter.com. Twitter.com doesn’t even exist anymore, so you don’t have to go there. I have a show similar to this but not very. I—there’s a Star Wars podcast where I was watching Clone Wars, and then I was watching Rebels, but I can’t do that anymore, so now we’re playing KOTOR. 
Keith: You told me that you were playing KOTOR and it didn’t occur to me that it would be for anything other than the enjoyment of playing KOTOR. 
Ali: Uh-huh. Yeah. 
Keith: But now I get it. 
Ali: Uh-huh. 
Keith: You’ll probably be done with that game by the time this goes—no, that’s not true. That’s not fair. 
Ali: No.
Keith: No. But you’ll be very deep into it probably. 
Ali: Yeah, we’ll be—we’ll be close. 
Keith: How far in are you as of now?
Ali: I—we’re not even off of Taris yet. 
Keith: Yeah, Taris is long. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Keith: I like Taris. I’m a Taris defender. 
Ali: I—yeahhh! 
Keith: I’m a Carth defender. 
Sylvia: [laughs]
Dre: [dubiously] Ooooooh. 
Ali: You’re a Carth defender…
Dre: [making dubious, cringing noises as Keith speaks]
Keith: Yeah I actually don’t understand, I don’t even, like I can’t even figure out how you could ever feel any way besides like neutral about Carth? I don’t even see—
Ali: Uh, b—well, there’s—there’s, there’s a couple reasons— [laughs] 
Keith: Oh, if you’re playing as a girl Carth is the worst. [Sylvia: Who’s Carth?] I always forget about that. [Ali laughs] Carth is way worse—
Sylvia: [cross] Oh he’s that guy. 
Ali: Also if you have a really high charisma he will try to talk to you every 5 seconds. 
Sylvia: [cross] Just like real life. 
Keith: [cross] Yyyyeah, but that’s not, that’s the game, you can’t—you can’t hold that against Carth. That’s not Carth’s fault. 
Ali: I…yeah. 
Keith: It is not Carth’s fault that Rob made the worst build that anyone’s ever made [Ali laughs] for KOTOR. It’s not— [laughs]
Sylvia: Damn. 
Ali: I will say, I’ve played that game before and not—like, getting out of the apartment complex, Carth wants to talk to you. Not being able to walk across the street [Sylvia laughs] before he wants to talk to you again, the—I can’t get into the, uh, second building in this video game before this man wants to tell me he doesn’t trust me. I’m over it.
Keith: It’s funny that—it’s funny that this came up, [Sylvia laughs] that you started playing this, ‘cause I was playing Baldur’s Gate last month, like right before the first episode of the show dropped, and I was playing through Baldur’s Gate 3, and I was like, wow, they haven’t really gotten better as a genre of—or even as media. Video games have like not improved on how well you can tell a story since KOTOR 1. [Ali laughs] Like that is the level that we’re still at. 
Sylvia: [cross] Wow, that’s a take. Holy shit that’s a take. 
Keith: [cross] Yeah. And I really do think it’s like, I’m watching—I’m watching cutscenes in Baldur’s Gate 3 and I’m like, this—this could’ve just be KOTOR. 
Ali: [continuous laughter]
Dre: [cross] No. You’re not—you’re not wrong. 
Sylvia: [cross] Have you considered that they are the same genre? 
Keith: [cross] They are the same genre—
Sylvia: [cross] That they are both CRPGs? Have you considered that?
Keith: [cross] I—yeah yeah yeah! Of course! Yeah! 
Dre: No, I’m with you. No, Keith. I’m a hundred percent with you on this take, because as someone who has beaten Baldur’s Gate 3 and liked it, as I finished it I was like, this looks better than Baldur’s Gate 2, but it’s the same thing. 
Keith: Yeah, and I—you know—
Dre: [cross] It’s the same thing. 
Keith: I don’t think—and the thing is like yeah, it’s a CRPG, but you know, venture outside the CRPG genre and like what is mainstream video games delivering in story that a CRPG isn’t? [Sylvia: Ummmm…] You know what I mean? Like now I’m playing Starfield and I’m like, this is even worse! Like—like—this is—
Sylvia: [cross] Well, okay. C’mon. 
Dre: [cross] Well, yeah.
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: That’s like talking about the taste of soylent. Like, come on now. 
Keith: Um. I think soylent tastes fine. 
Sylvia: Okay, we need to fuckin’ talk about anime. 
Ali: [laughs]
Summary [0:09:37] 
Keith: Uh, okay, these episodes are kinda nuts. I love these episodes—
Sylvia: [cross] We watched four! [Dre: Yeah!] Is this our first four episode? 
Keith: This is our first four. We had a four scheduled but because of scheduling issues we changed it. We added an episode to the season to split up the four. [Sylvia: Right.] Yeah. So we created [Ali: Mmm.] a like, two threes and a two out of what was a four. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Keith: Uh, so quick recap. Gon continues the like, uh, the Hanzo fight style of bullheadedness, the self-endangering, “I’m gonna get my way” sort of attitude that he kind of develops in the middle of the Hanzo fight, by following Killua to assassin mountain, actually called uh, Kukuroo Mountain? 
Sylvia: Kukuroo Mountain, yep. 
Dre: Kukuroo, yep. 
Keith: And insisting on being allowed to be eaten by the dog that they have that is the size of a house. 
Sylvia: [laughs]
Ali: Mmm. 
Keith: Uh, Mike. Love Mike. Mike is…terrifying—
Dre: [cross] Mike [pronounced mee-kay] but spelled Mike [pronounced like the nickname for Michael]. 
Keith: Yes, Mike [pronounced like the nickname for Michael] the dog. [Dre and Keith laugh] Um...uh, Mike is terrifying, great thumbnail, this is one of the very good thumbnails of uh— [Sylvia: Oh yeah.] I don’t know if everyone has the same thumbnail but it is just like the horrible image of this evil dog, Mike. Anyway, he is convinced to not be killed by Mike because the very very nice fake security guard Zebro is like, “Hey if you get eaten by this dog I’m gonna be in big trouble,” and Gon’s like, “Oh, okay, sorry.” Uh, so instead they train in a house full of Piccolo’s training gear, the heavy clothes, [Sylvia laughs] maybe Rock Lee’s training gear, if you knew that. [Sylvia: Yeah?] Uh, it just—heavy cups, heavy teapots, heavy chairs, heavy doors—
Dre: [cross] Heavy bathroom doors. 
Keith: Very heavy bathroom, it’s 500 kilograms. 
Dre: That’s 1100 pounds, if you’re curious. 
Keith: We also get a taste of what Illumi references in the last episode about how they live in different worlds, y’know, Gon is never gonna be able to get to Killua, they just live in different worlds. It’s not true, they do get to Killua, but we get a great taste of this when Zebro explains the rules to the door. Does someone wanna quickly say the rules to the door? 
Sylvia: Oh, the—you mean the fake door and the real door?
Keith: The fake door and the real door. So they have the fake door—we’ll go over the fake door—but how heavy is the real door? 
Sylvia: Oh I don’t have the exact—
Keith: Does someone have the—I have the exact, if no one else has [Sylvia: Wait—] the exact. 
Dre: It was—so the first door is like two tons, [Keith: Two tons.] and then every other door is twice as much?
Keith: Two tons per side, so four tons. And then yeah, it is like a series of increasingly heavy doors that every time you walk through it it tests how strong you are, going two tons—sorry, four tons, eight tons, sixteen tons, [Dre: Sixteen.] thirty-two tons, sixty-four tons, and I think that there’s—the highest one is 128 tons. Maybe sixty-four—
Dre: [cross] It goes up to seven doors. 
Keith: Oh it does go? So it goes even higher. Okay. Uh, Killua—
Sylvia: I’m like Gon trying to do that math. 
Keith: [laughs] 
Dre: Same. Uh-huh. 
Keith: That was a great scene. Uh, Killua, for example, got through sixteen tons worth of door, that’s metric tons, that’s 35000 pounds. [Ali laughs] Jack has been thinking a lot about how strong Killua might or might not be through these first twenty-something episodes, and this is our first, like, we have a range. He’s strong somewhere between sixteen metric tons and thirty-two metric tons. 
Dre: Hey, uh, I have uh—I have an important thing to contribute?
Keith: Okay.
Dre: Uh, I googled things that weigh about sixteen tons. Do you wanna know some things that weigh about sixteen tons?
Keith: Yeah. 
Jack: Of course I do. 
Dre: Uh, around fifty-four tigers. 
Keith: [scoffs] Okay! 
Jack: [laughs]
Sylvia: Pssh, around. [Keith: Around.] [Dre: Uh-huh.] Like there’s some wiggle room. 
Keith: Yeah there’s some wiggle room. [Ali laughs] Your average tiger, sixteen pounds. Or fifty—
Dre: About six and a half blocks from the Great Pyramid of Giza.
Keith: How many?
Jack: Hm. 
Dre: Six and a half. 
Keith: Six and a half? And honestly, that is like kind of what the door looks like. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. Um, this is all just—half of this article is just numbers of animals. [Ali laughs] Uh, fifty-seven pigs. 
Sylvia: Whaaaa? Okay. 
Dre: Twenty-seven horses and twenty-one cows. One—
Keith: Are you telling me that the pigs they measured were barely lighter [Ali: Wait—] than the—than the tigers? 
Dre: That’s a good point. I mean, pigs are pretty fuckin’ heavy. 
Keith: Pigs get big, but I guess tigers are—are lean. [Sylvia laughs] [Dre: Yeah.] I’ve seen—I’ve seen cats. I know what a big cat would look like. 
Ali: [snorts]
Dre: Uh, thirty-two grand pianos, one Bryde’s whale? 
Keith: Okay, so it’s—so it’s one Bryde’s whale. That’s perfect. [Dre: Yeah. Uh-huh.] That’s a one-to-one with something we all get. Is a Bryde’s whale. [Jack laughs] Uh, not since the start of the Hunter Exam have we had such a paradise for freaks. [Everyone laughs] It’s been a long time since we’ve had a bunch of new characters, it was a breath of fresh air, we got introduced to person after person after person, starting with the two most normal people and getting to the biggest freaks right at the end, it was great. Uh, we met a bunch of the Zoldyck family, we met a bunch of their employees, and we get to see all of their personal interests and their relationships with my best friend Killua. Uh—
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: Hold on a second, Killua’s my best friend. 
Keith: I said it first! 
Sylvia: Fuck! 
Keith and Ali: [laugh]
Sylvia: God damnit! 
Dre: [cross] Uh, I call dibs on Gon, Gon’s my best friend. 
Jack: [cross] Them’s the rules! 
Ali: [cross] Woah, woah! Dibs? 
Dre: [cross] Now nobody else can have Gon. 
Keith: [laughing uproariously] Sylvi’s getting out-shotgunned! 
Ali: [laughs] 
Dre: [in a stage whisper] Jack! Jack! Quick, call Kurapika! And then Sylvi has to hang out with Leorio. 
Ali: [cross] I’ll take Leorio. 
Jack: [cross] I’m not gonna do this.
Sylvia: [cross] You’re gonna make me hang out with Leorio? After you saw what he did in Trick Tower? 
Keith: [cross] Oh sorry, Ali just took Leorio. 
Dre: [howling with laughter] 
Sylvia: [cross] Jeez, what you saw—oh cool—
Keith: Sylvi, you can hang out with Pokkle. 
Sylvi: [quietly] Fine. 
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: You don’t wanna play fun trivia games with Leorio? 
Jack: I’m gonna head out—
Sylvia: I’m gonna visit the Blowjob Brothers and wear a matching outfit. 
Keith and Dre: [laugh] 
Ali: Um, I—is this not a Leorio respect zone? I’m sorry. 
Keith: [cross] Yeah, no, it is. It is. 
Sylvia: [cross] No, I love Leorio. 
Dre: [cross] No. Yes. 
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: It’s ‘cause also I don’t wanna be alone in a room with Leorio? 
Ali: [laughs] 
Keith: Leorio is in—in a lot of other shows would be uh, the joke character that everyone hates, but in this one he’s the joke character that everyone loves. [Ali: Mm-hmm.] But has to just be put up against the three, uh, y’know, the three best boys. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Ali: [laughing] Suuuure. But—but—
Dre: Also though is the joke character that can push two tons worth of door. 
Ali: Yeahhhhh!
Keith: With a little help. 
Dre: Well yeah, but like Kurapika also needed a little help. 
Keith: [cross] Yeah. He got his side, he got his side. For sure. 
Dre: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Keith: Um—
Ali: He wears a little suit. He wants to go to school. [laughs]
Dre: [cross] That’s true. 
Keith: [cross] He wears a little suit and wants to go to school. 
Ali: [cross] What’s wrong with him? [continues to laugh] 
Keith: No, nothing—I love Leorio. Leorio’s great. 
Sylvia: He’s a—he’s a nice young man, [Dre: He is.] he is just also a little bit of a pervert sometimes. 
Keith: [cross] He is a pervert. 
Ali: [cross] Sure. 
Dre: And shit, he get big angry. 
Keith: [cross] He does. 
Sylvia: [cross] That’s fine—he’s passionate. 
Dre: [cross] For like no reason sometimes. 
Keith: [cross] He’s passionate. 
Ali: [cross] Yeah. 
Sylvia: Hey Ali, I’m gonna hang out with you and Leorio. 
Ali: [laughs] Cool! All right, come on over!
Sylvia: [cross] Yeahhh! 
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: Uh, we get some new music in this episode. We got a, a taste of new music in the last episode. We got the song “Family,” wait, is that the name of the song? I might’ve gotten it wrong. 
Sylvia: The Zoldyck theme? 
Keith: The Zoldyck theme, yeah. Uh, I might’ve accidentally gotten the name of a different Zoldyck theme from one of the movies by mistake. 
Sylvia: [cross] Yeah, I don’t know the—
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: Fair enough. 
Keith: Anyway, it’s the—it is like the choral, like, y’know, the—they’re screaming, they’re singing like, “Zoldycks are the best, Zoldycks are the best,” but in Latin. 
Sylvia: [laughs] 
Dre: Mmm. 
Sylvia: Yeah, basically. 
Keith: And then we get uh, this episode, we get the intense guitar solo determination music, which is awesome. The uh, [mimicking an electric guitar] “Whah-neh-neh-neh-nao-nao, whah-neh-neh-neh-nao-nao.” 
Sylvia: [laughs]
Dre: Uh-huh! 
Keith: [cross] Everyone knows what I’m talking about?
Sylvia: [cross] Yeah!
Keith: Uh—
Sylvia: No, I do know what you’re—I, I popped real hard when that showed up. I got so excited. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Keith: Any—any comments on the—on the beginning of this first episode? Anybody have anything that stood out for you?
Sylvia: Oh! There’s um, the intro’s different. We don’t get the big monsters, mystical treasures…
Jack: Yes, this is gone! 
Dre: Oh, like the narrator intro—
Sylvia: Yeah! 
Keith: Oh!
Dre: Yeah.
Sylvia: We get—it’s a cold open!
Ali: Oh. 
Keith: It’s solved now, they—they consider, “What is a Hunter?” asked and answered. We now know. 
Ali: [laughs] 
Dre: It’s our three friends. That’s what a Hunter is. 
Keith: [cross] It’s someone who passes the Hunter Exam. Is what a Hunter is. 
Dre: [cross] Yeah. 
Jack: Yeah. Uh—
Keith: I actually missed that. I did I—I pressed the “skip intro” button [Dre: Yeah, me too.] and so it went right past it—
Sylvia: Fake fans. Fake fans!
Ali: Ohhhhh…
Keith: Yeah, I don’t watch the intro every time…
Sylvia: Killua’s gonna be my friend now. 
Ali: [laughs] 
Dre: Damn. 
Keith: Killua cares about watching intros. 
Jack: I think the—
Sylvia: [cross] I know he doesn’t. Sorry, go ahead. 
Episode 22 [0:18:44] 
Jack: [laughs] I think the first thing that I kinda wanna touch on in this episode is the way that the arrival to Kukuroo Mountain and the headquarters of the infamous feared murderous Zoldyck family, who our, you know, first encounter with a Zoldyck family member other than Killua was Illumi’s terrifying, sort of, intro at the end of the Hunter Exam. And so—
Keith: Yeah, like very Dracula, like, [makes thunder noises] [Jack: Yeah.] like thunder and lightning, Kukuroo Mountain, yeah. 
Jack: And it is, I think really clever and I think super in keeping with the way that the show talks about its world, that the way we are actually introduced to the Zoldycks proper is via a tour bus. [Dre: Uh-huh.] With a woman on a tour bus. The bus only runs once a day, but you will have a guide, and this is called Lamentation Tours. 
Keith and Dre: [laugh] 
Keith: [laughing] It’s so funny! 
Sylvia: It’s so good! 
Dre: [cross] It’s so good! 
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: I fucking love it. 
Keith: Lamentation Tours! 
Dre: Okay. I made a note. And I need to see if I can just read this and if you all are like, “Yeah, no, that makes sense,” or if you think I’m insane. 
Sylvia: Uh-huh! 
Dre: Um, this tour guide lady looks like a Pokémon character. 
Jack: [cross] Oh no, she super does! 
Keith: [cross] Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Ali: [cross] Suuuuure, yeah. 
Keith: [cross] Yeah, she does. 
Dre: Pshew! Whew! Okay. All right. 
Sylvia: Yeah. Also, do you guys wanna guess what her name is? It’s only in the 1999 anime. 
Jack: What is her name?
Dre and Ali: Ohhhh. 
Keith: What is her name? [cross] Oh wait, does Ali know? 
Sylvi: [cross] Her name is Coco Loo. 
Ali: [laughs] 
Sylvia: Oh sorry, it’s not in the manga either. 
Keith: It’s not in the manga? Oh, well they only—
Sylvia: [cross] It’s just in the ‘99 anime. 
Keith: [cross] Oh, okay, okay, what was her name?
Jack: And it’s—
Sylvia: Coco Loo? 
Keith: Coco Loo. 
Sylvia: And she works at Kukuroo Mountain. 
Keith: Coco Loo from Kukuroo? 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Dre: Ohhhh, that’s good. 
Keith: That’s very funny.
Dre: [cross] That’s pretty good! 
Jack: [cross] She shows up, and she’s got her little microphone, and she’s saying, you know, that the—here is where the Zoldyck family lives, and they are rumored to live somewhere on the mountain, though nobody has ever seen the uh, house. She gives us a little background, she says that the Zoldyck family has ten members. I love that she’s giving us like the little fact sheet from this tour. But the bus pulls up—
Keith: And we get an outline of everyone! 
Jack: We do get an outline of everyone, but I think the outline—
Sylvia: Including Tommy Pickles! 
Keith: I literally wrote that down in my thing! 
Sylvia: I’m so glad, Keith, [cross] I’m so glad you’re with me on this! 
Keith: [cross] I literally wrote Tommy Pickles. [laughs] 
Ali: [laughs] 
Keith: That’s funny. 
Jack: Um, yeah. And uh, so they show up and they do a little photo op outside the gate, which is called the Door to Hades, this is this sort of, like uh, this ridiculous door that we’ve already talked about, everybody goes out and takes some pictures. Two guys show up and they’re like, “Oh, if we can get a picture of the—of any Zoldyck assassin we can get loads of money.” Leorio is mad because he wishes that [Sylvia laughs] they had taken a picture of Killua [Ali laughs] [Keith: Yeah.] and got a lot of money. And then in go the two guys in through this little door and are instantly turned into skeletons. [cross] Just murdered violently by Mike. 
Keith: [cross] Yeah, it is just they—they run through the thing and it’s just screaming, screaming, screaming.
Jack: And then this hand comes out, [Dre: Uh-huh.] this monstrous hand comes out holding the skeletons, and the tour group, uh, you know, bounces and leaves. Um, and I think this is—
Keith: Most popular spot on the tour. 
Jack: What, the, the, the door where [cross] people occasionally get killed?
Keith: [cross] Yeah, just, the uh, Killua’s mountain—yeah, the, the Kukuroo Mountain gate, is like the—I think they say it in a uh, one of the intros or outros after this. They’re like, “It’s the most popular spot on the, on the tour!” [Jack laughs] Which is very funny. It’s not just on the tour, it’s like the feature of the tour. 
Jack: Yeah. And I think that like in the way that we’ve talked about the Hunter Exam as being this—mm. The existence of Hunters in this world implies this bizarre heightened reality where, uh, you know, it’s a—the whole world is a freak’s paradise. [Ali snorts] As you put it earlier, Keith. 
Keith: Yeah. [laughs]
Sylvia: Shit. 
Jack: And I think the fact that it’s like a—there is this murderous family of assassins who are ultimately also a tourist destination for a lot of people in this world [Dre: Mm-hmm.] is fascinating. Um, and is a kind of twist on what Illumi said at the end of the Hunter Exam, where he was like, “We don’t exactly—the locals know about us.” And at the time I had sort of imagined this little mountain, and, and you know like local villages being like, “Oh the assassins live up on the mountain.” But now that I think about it, is so much in keeping with the way this show thinks about the, the weird and the mundane sitting, like, cheek by jowl, uh, that they’re just a tourist destination. 
Keith: Yeah, yeah. Uh, can we rewind actually, because, Ali, this is your first time on the show, how is your experience catching up with the manga?
Ali: Um, it’s been fun! It’s been good. Um, so I read the manga up to this point, and then I also watched the episodes. 
Keith: Oh you did? 
Ali: Um, yeah. Well just to like be able to keep up with the conversation and also just like, know how to pronounce names. [laughs] [Keith: Sure.] And like understand how like, differently it’s packaged. And I was like—
Keith: Did you watch all of them? To the—
Ali: No, no, no. [Keith: Okay.] Just the, just the set for this—this episode. Um, 22 to 25. Um, and like, there’s a real tonal shift? I don’t wanna say that there’s a tonal—I guess like, the—the manga is also like sort of campy and fun and lighthearted even when like fucked up things are happening. [Keith: Yeah.] But like, the music in the show, and like the way that each of these episodes open up with like, this like really pleasant narrator talking about pastoral, like, [cross] the mountaintop where the assassins hang out. 
Keith: [cross] I like that, yeah. 
Sylvia: [laughs] 
Ali: Um, was not what I was expecting. I guess the other thing is like, this is—this is my first experience doing something like this where it’s not like, “Oh I’ve watched the thing once and a couple years later I’m gonna read it.” Or I’m just gonna read this thing, um, and later the anime comes out so I’ll check it out. Like doing it side by side, the thing that stuck out the most is like how much time [laughs] this series of things took, versus how long it does in the manga, because it’s just like, “Here’s a person, we’ll fight them. Here’s a weird building, we’re gonna hang out in it. Okay.” [Sylvia laughs] “Now everything is resolved,” and that took me like an hour to read it or whatever, whereas in the show it was like, there was more backstory, and you get more of these characters, which is really fun, but I was also just like, oh, okay, yeah. Okay yep, they’re in the house now. [laughs]
Keith: It’s funny that—it’s funny that the—I know that this is actually true a lot of the time for anime adaptations of manga where like, actually the anime gets more time to breathe, not less, which is, I think, uh, for uh, like, movie adaptations of books or TV show adaptations of books in America, I feel like usually oh the adaptation leaves out all of this detail. Uh, but it ends up being the opposite for a lot of anime, which is kinda funny. I didn’t—it didn’t occur to me that you would be breezing through these chapters in the manga [Ali laughs] and then—because I do actually have a line in here—it is one of the slower sections in the show so far. [Ali: Mm-hmm.] Uh, Gon’s like super healing ability kicks in just in time for this sub-arc not to drag. [Ali laughs] [Dre: Uh-huh.] Like, yeah, they spend about, they spend about just over one episode training and then Gon’s arm is fine and uh, he can solve the day. Which is like basically perfectly timed. If it was any longer, I would’ve been like, okay, c’mon. I like Zebro and Seaquant as much as the next guy. [Ali: Uh-huh.] Those are the names of the—they pretend to be security guards but they’re actually just there to show intruders how to get in, which is really funny. The whole thing is that—it’s just to—no one that’s gonna invade can actually get up there. That is the—that is at least what the Zoldycks think, so instead of letting people damage the gate, they sort of funnel people through the gate to just get eaten by Mike. Zebro says something really funny, which is, “For some reason, 80-90 percent of intruders just try to go through the front gate.” Which is really funny, and uh, also probably exactly what they want. They don’t want people blowing holes in the gate. [Dre: Sure.] Just aesthetically, I bet. It’s just a pain to fix. 
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: Oh yeah you know that like, if the Zoldycks were like, in a like community and not just on a mountaintop, they’d be running the like, the like, um—Homeowners Association or something. 
Keith: Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Ali: Oh, sure. 
Sylvia: They’d be such sticklers about your lawns, especially Mrs. Zoldyck. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Ali: I wanna see the Architect Digest like YouTube video, [Everyone laughs] about this property so badly. 
Jack: [laughs]
Keith: Genuinely, a huge—
Jack: [imitating an HGTV host] Silva and Kikyo Zoldyck and their ten children—or, actually, wait, [Ali laughs] I don’t know how many children they have. Fewer than ten. 
Keith: I think there’s five? 
Jack: [imitating an HGTV host] This murderous family of assassins and their grandfather [Ali laughs] and their 40-foot-tall dog have made their home on beautiful Kukuroo Mountain. 
Keith: If you are not watching these episodes, and Ali, I don’t know how they portray Mike’s size in the manga, but Mike’s the size of a house. Mike is like—
Ali: [cross] Yeah, Mike is huge. 
Keith: [cross] Yeah, Mike is like, not just a big dog. 
Dre: [cross] Yeah, he’s big. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Keith: Yeah. He is like 50 feet tall. 
Jack: I wanna—let’s talk about Mike actually. Because um, there is a bit of business in and around this gate with this guy called Zebro, who is—
Keith: About two episodes of business. 
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: Yeah—
Sylvia: Yeah. Episode and a half. 
Jack: This has happened a few times making this show. I—we will get into a chunk of episodes that you all are really excited about and I will watch about an episode and a half and go, eh. [makes unimpressed noise] [Sylvia: Yeah.] [Ali laughs] And then I will watch the back half of the chunk, and go, oh this is fucking great. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Ali and Dre: [laugh] 
Jack: And this absolutely happened here, because—
Dre: [cross] Here’s the real shit.
Jack: [cross] —we do, we do a lot of pissing about outside the gate. It’s not terribly interesting, but eventually Zebro is like, “Look. Here’s the deal. Mike won’t attack you if you go through the testing gate, this very very heavy gate. He only attacks you if you go through this little trap gate that we’ve made. But, tell you what, I’m gonna let you in, and I’ll show you Mike, [Keith: Yeah.] so you can make a decision about what to do.” And—
Keith: I do agree that these—that this bit of the episode is kind of slow, but there is a lot of really fun character stuff here, especially for Gon. Like we do get this like, absolute like, pedal to the metal death wish. [Dre: Mm-hmm.] Gon has a death wish. Like he is like, “I will get the thing that I am looking for and I don’t, I literally don’t care if it kills me. It’s not that I don’t believe that I’ll die, I genuinely will do it despite death.” But then the second that Zebro is like, “Actually, you doing this would inconvenience me, so I’m going to help you, [Ali and Dre laugh] I’m going to help you because then at least I’ll die immediately instead of, y’know, being killed by the Zoldycks.” And uh, Gon’s like, “Oh my god, I didn’t—I didn’t mean to cause you any trouble at all.” [Ali laughs] Uh…
Jack: He’s—
Ali: He’s a good boy! 
Keith: [cross] He is a good boy. 
Jack: [cross] He’s such a good boy.
Dre: [cross] He’s the best boy. 
Keith: Can I read this sort of—this sort of ideological statement by Zebro about Gon? [Ali: Sure.] It’s a couple of sentences here. “He’s a good boy. He’s willing to quell his own anger for the sake of another person. He believes in his own strength as well as in his friends. He has a strong heart. It’s likely that Mike won’t frighten him at all.” He was wrong on one of those things. 
Sylvia: Yeah, [cross] he was only wrong about the last thing. 
Jack: [cross] Yes. 
Dre: [cross] Uh-huh. 
Keith: Yes, Mike—
Jack: Because the thing that happens is—
Keith: Yeah, go ahead. 
Jack: —it is fully implied that what we’re going to get is one of these “Gon understands nature and nature understands Gon”-type scenes. You know, we’ve seen this with the blood butterflies. We’ve seen this all over. Gon is the little boy of the forest—
Keith: Yeah, the storm, the Kirikos…
Jack: The storm, the whole, uh, y’know. And they really are setting it up to be like, Gon is going to look into the eyes of Mike and Mike and Gon are going to come to an understanding. And instead, Mike—
Keith: Is Jaws. 
Jack: I’m sure I’ve talked about this—well, it’s weirder than that. I’ve talked about this on the—on a show before, I think definitely recently, but there’s a ridiculous Disney Halloween movie that they made years ago of the story of Sleepy Hollow, and it’s a very much a sort of like classic Disney tale with a wacky Ichabod Crane or whatever until the Headless Horseman’s horse is introduced and the horse is drawn and animated in this completely different style than anything else. It looks like a gothic horror animal. 
Keith: I think I’ve seen this. 
Jack: And it sits in every frame like a nightmare because it is—it is come from another movie and has broken into this movie, and it’s—it’s brilliant. And Mike is very similar. There is something alien and cold and upsetting about the way Mike looks. He is a sort of wolf? But he’s 40 feet tall and he uh, has—
Keith: Muscular human arms. 
Jack: He has muscular human arms. [Dre: Uh-huh.] And he has these horrible alien blue eyes. Uh, they’re not—
Sylvia: Uh—
Jack: Hm?
Sylvia: He has eyes that look like Illumi's. Is—
Dre: [cross] Yes, yes!
Jack: [cross] He does have eyes that look like Illumi’s. 
Ali: [cross] Ohhhhhh… 
Keith: [cross] He does—he does have that, yeah. 
Jack: Um…
Keith: It—this is—this is why I saw Jaws. The eyes reminded me of uh, the Jaws doll’s eyes speech, yeah. 
Jack: Like a doll’s eyes. [laughs] Yes. And he is just whenever he’s on screen at this point, he is very—he moves very deliberately. He is very still. He just looks down at Gon with this kind of absent alien intelligence, and Gon is fucking terrified. [laughs]
Dre: Yes. 
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: [laughing] He’s just like sweating bullets. He’s just like, “I cannot reach this, this is—this is a level of evil beyond me.” Uh, he felt like a Dark Souls character, was the other thing I wrote down. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Ali: Oh, sure. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Jack: Huge Mike fan. 
Keith: Yeah, yeah, I love Mike— [Ali: I— [laughs]] I like—he like looks scraggly and his nose is so long it’s bizarre. 
Sylvia: He’s got like—he’s like a demonic Borzoi in a lot of ways. 
Keith: [laughing] He is like— [cross] He does sort of look like a Borzoi. 
Dre: [cross] Yes! [laughs]
Sylvia: [cross] Yeah. 
Keith: He also looks—he also looks a little bit like Wile E. Coyote.
Sylvia: Yes. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Ali: Okay!
Keith: You know those like, those like realistic Pokémon where it’s like [Sylvia laughs] this is just Charizard [Dre: Oh my god.] but a dragon, like this is like [Dre: Yeah.] sort of realistic Wile E. Coyote. 
Ali: Sure. I—I do love how like simply this—this wraps up, I guess. There’s a lot of back and forth about like, “Oh which way are we gonna go?” and then Gon is like, “I’m gonna go in there no matter what it takes.” And then it’s just like we—we have the familiarity with Gon being like, animal specialist [Dre: Yeah.] of the crew that like, seeing him scared and seeing the janitor just sort of no-sell the situation is just like [Jack laughs] oh okay, well we’re—we’ve gotten past this. We’ve learned who Mike is. [laughs]
Keith: Yeah. 
Jack: [laughing] Yes. 
Keith: And there—there is this um, like, this like, sub-thing of like, why is the janitor helping Gon at all? And it’s like, okay, part of it is that it could be a hassle for him if Gon ends—winds up dead, uh, and the other thing is, y’know, we’ve seen it again and again, but he is impressed by Gon and is like, sort of compelled to help him because of his sort of earnest passion. And then there’s this third thing where we will run into it a lot. Uh, a lot of these employees are rightfully scared of the Zoldycks and worried about Killua. [laughs] Like—
Jack: Yeah! There is something really interesting going on where the employees know that they—that their lives are utterly dependent on the Zoldycks. The Zoldycks can and seemingly will kill them or, or, or worse, for any transgression. ‘Cause that’s what the Zoldycks do. They are killers. And also the employees aren’t quite as—hm. The employees, it seems, intuit that Killua is a twelve-year-old child who is in a bad place. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Jack: [cross] As opposed to—
Keith: [cross] Like physically in a—in a bad geo—geographical place. 
Jack: Yeah. Yeah, [Ali snorts] and this sort of becomes a theme of these episodes as we continue is Zoldyck employees going—hm. Zoldyck employees seeing Gon as an opportunity for Killua to [Keith: Yeah.] get a—like a light in his life. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Keith: Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Does—does anyone wanna talk about the scenes that we’re cutting to while this gatehouse stuff is going on?
[pause]
Keith: With Killua. 
Sylvia: Oh, the stuff with Killua? 
Keith: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Dre: Mmm. 
Sylvia: Uh—
Keith: Or does no one wanna talk about it?
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: [cross] No, we have we—listen—
Dre: [cross] It’s very sad. 
Keith: [laughs]
Sylvia: I am—I am prepared—
Keith: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Sylvia: —for Killua chat, okay? This is a highlight of my week is talking about Killua. 
Dre: He’s your best friend. 
Sylvia: He’s my—I wish. 
Keith: Yeah. Sorry. Someone called dibs. 
Sylvia: I got out-dibsed, yeah. Um…
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: The—I’m just looking for my—do we cut to that in this first episode at all, actually?
Keith: Oh, it might—it, it’s possible that it’s, it’s at the start here of the second one. 
Sylvia: Yeah, I think we might like get one—
Keith: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that’s at the beginning of 23. [Sylvia: Yeah.] Well we did, we did end 22 basically. Mike is the end of 22. Are there any other 22 thoughts before we go to 23? 
Jack: Yes. I really quickly want to talk about Zebro telephoning the mansion. 
Keith: Oh yeah. 
Sylvia: Oh my god, yes. 
Jack: So Zebro calls the mansion and says, “Some of Killua’s friends are here.” And I don’t know if we hear the other side of the conversation. But Zebro’s like, “Yep.” 
Sylvia: [quietly] I don’t think we do. 
Jack: Oh we do? 
Sylvia: No, we don’t. I don’t think we do. 
Jack: [cross] Oh we don’t get that—
Sylvia: [cross] We just get Zebro apologizing. 
Keith: [cross] We just get like [muffling his voice] “Momf, mmf, mmmf, womf.” 
Ali: [snorts]
Jack: Zebro is like, “All right. Okay. Sounds good. Sorry.” And he puts the phone down. Uh, and then Gon just runs up and dials the number and picks the phone up again and gets connected to the butler, a man whose name we do not have at this point, but we will later learn is called Gotoh. Uh, and the butler is shot like a scary person in an anime ‘cause that’s exactly what he is. 
Sylvia: [laughs]
Keith: [cross] Uh, if anyone needs—
Ali: [cross] Mmmmm. 
Keith: If anyone needs this mental image, uh he’s shot like evil nightmare Porkchop from Doug if anyone else has seen the episode of Doug [Sylvia: Sure?] where he has bad dreams. 
Dre: [baffled] What?
Keith: Yeah there’s an episode of Doug where he’s—
Sylvia: I never watched Doug. 
Keith: —he has—he has a recurring bad dream where Porkchop like wants to kill him, his dog, and he’s like [Sylvia: Ohhhhh.] very menacingly flipping a coin in the exact same way that Gotoh is. And—
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: Yeah, Gotoh is flipping this coin, um—
Keith: This was so scary to me as a child and so I—I always think of that when I see Gotoh flipping the coin. 
Jack: [laughs] Um, and the butler basically, uh—the butler tries a couple of different tacts, he says, “Killua doesn’t have friends,” first of all. This is going to become the refrain of these episodes, uh, “Killua doesn’t have friends.” Uh, and then he tries a different tact, and I don’t think he actually believes what he’s saying here, I think he’s just trying to put Gon off the scent by saying, “Hey, hey, how do I know that you are actually Gon? You know, you could be someone mimicking Gon’s voice. And even if I were to see you and let you see Killua you could be taking on Killua’s form.” Which is some real people in glass houses throwing stones type-situation, given that his boss is Illumi, someone who we just saw doing that. And on that level this reads almost like a threat. “We are so—you know, I am saying that you know, you might be a, you might be an invader, but really what I’m saying is we come from a place where people can change their voices, people can change their appearances, you need to—again, you are in a different world now. [Keith: Yeah.] You have entered the Zoldyck family’s world, not Gon’s.”
Keith: Yeah, I read it sort of as like, “It doesn’t matter what the truth is, it’s our job to not trust you.”
Jack: Mm-hmm. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Jack: Uh, the other thing here is this is absolutely the vibe of trying to telephone your friend and their scary dad picking up the phone. 
Everyone: [laughs] 
Ali: Yeah…
Jack: Being like, “I wanna talk to Killua!” 
Sylvia: God, imagine if Killua’s dad picked up the phone. [laughs] 
Jack: Oh, I’m so excited to talk about Killua’s dad. [Dre: Mm-hmm] But I think that’s all I have to say for 22. Does anybody else have any other 22 thoughts before we move on to 23? 
[pause]
Sylvia: I think I’m set. 
Ali: Mm-hmm. 
Episode 23 [0:40:00] 
Jack: This is the heavy house chapter. 
Keith: This is the heavy house chapter, yeah. 
Jack: Where they go to this house and they wear extremely heavy clothes. Uh, just—
Keith: Yeah, we meet Seaquant. 
Jack: —good physical humor. Yes, we meet Seaquant who we learned in the past was part of a crew that tried to storm the Zoldyck mansion and were handily defeated by an apprentice butler who we see in silhouette standing on like [laughs] a pile of corpses. 
Keith: [laughs]
Sylvia: Oh, fucking great. 
Keith: Yeah, and so he decides to just get a job there instead. [laughs]
Ali: [snorts]
Jack: [laughs]
Sylvia: You know…
Keith: I guess I work here now! [Sylvia laughs] All my friends are dead. I work here now. 
Sylvia: [laughs] Try saying that when you walk into a Wendy’s and see how it goes. 
Ali: Mmmm. 
Keith: [laughs] Uh, yes, so they, they put on their heavy jackets and they lift their heavy cups. Gon is sort of prevented from training because of his broken arm but is training in secret at night. 
Sylvia: It is very funny when they put the, the like weighted vests on how Leorio is the one who falls down [Ali snorts] and the other two are kinda fine. 
Keith: Yeah, um…
Sylvia: I also wrote, “Leorio thirsty flower pose,” because that is what he does, but I don’t know if that scans for anybody here. 
Keith: Is that the pee…
Ali: Suuure. 
Keith: The flower, yeah. 
Sylvia: “You have to water me you have to—” yeah. 
Ali: Yeaahhhhh. 
Sylvia: Um…
Keith: I don’t—I can’t think of the pose, but I do know what you are… 
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: I took a screenshot ‘cause I’m, you know. 
Keith: Okay. 
Sylvia: I gotta make sure my comedy is coming through to everyone. 
Keith and Ali: [laugh]
Sylvia: [laughs] 
Jack: I’m gonna see here…oh yeah you’re right! You’re absolutely right. 
Keith: Um, I do [wheezes] [Sylvia laughs] [Ali snorts] okay I didn’t remember this pose but I did actually mean the, the pose from the comic is what I didn’t remember. 
Everyone: [laughs] 
Keith: But that’s fine, I don’t—I, uh, we’re good. 
Sylvia: [laughs]
Keith: No, I’ll Google the—”pee flower comic”. 
Sylvia: No, wait! [wheezes] 
Keith: It’ll come up. “Thirsty little flower,” there we go. 
Ali: Mmm-hm? Mmmm. 
Keith: It is a similar face, I’ll give you that. 
Sylvia: It’s similar! 
Ali: Mm-hmm. 
Keith: Oh yeah, and then yeah, he’s on the ground. [Sylvia: Yeah!] Okay, I see it, I see it, I see it. 
Ali: [howling laugh] 
Sylvia: Thank you!
Keith: Yeah. It is that pose, it really is. 
Keith, Ali, and Jack: [laugh] 
Sylvia: [laughs]
Jack: Um, uh, lemme see. And they do some training here and we get a really cool training montage music that we haven’t heard before. It’s this sort of like—it’s lots of brass instruments. It’s like you said Keith, there is a lot of new music in this sort of arc. 
Sylvia: Mm-hmm!
Keith: Oh, I didn’t catch this other new music thing. It’s not the guitar one that I was talking about? The determination song? 
Jack: I don’t think so. This is as they are doing all the training together. But it might be that. [cross] I didn’t catch the guitar—
Keith: [cross] Okay, I think the guitar was in the last episode. 
Jack: No. But now might be a good point to talk about Killua. [Sylvia: Yeah.] Because as we are training we get to see for the first time the inside of the actual Zoldyck mansion, which is a torture dungeon! 
Sylvia: Yep!
Keith: Yep. 
Sylvia: Do you wanna—do you wanna go run down what the deal is with, or…
Keith: Okay—
Jack: I can just, I can just give the top level thing and then we can, we can dig into it. Killua is being whipped by his brother, a—an assassin [Sylvia: Milluki.] named Milluki, who we learned is the person that Killua stabbed on his way out along with his mom. Remember earlier we heard he attacked the two of them, Milluki is the one who got stabbed. And they are trying to get Killua to apologize, right? They’re specifically looking for an apology? 
Keith: Yeah. Yeah. They’re like not—the mom is basically not mad. She is obsessed with Killua. 
Jack: Oh right. Killua’s mom shows up. 
Sylvia: How do you feel about her, Jack? [laughs] What was your first impression when you saw this lady? 
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: Okay, absolutely not what I was expecting. 
Keith: How could you?
Jack: I think I was expecting—
Keith: How could you expect this? 
Jack: [laughs] I think I was expecting someone who looked more like Illumi, you know? [Keith: Yeah.] [Sylvia: Mm.] An older Illumi. And instead what we have is a woman dressed in a formal dress with a wide bustle. I think she has a parasol, or am I just—
Sylvia: [cross] No, she does. I believe so. 
Jack: [cross] —or does she just seem like the sort of person—she has a—oh, she has a fan, is what she has. 
Sylvia: Oh. 
Keith: Yeah, she has a fan. Yeah.
Jack: And her face is covered in bandages. [Keith: Fully covered.] And over her, well over her—well, her mouth is not covered, [Keith: Oh, sure.] and over her eyes she is wearing a visor that has a single red light glowing in the middle of it. She’s also wearing a massive floppy hat. Is—have I missed anything? Is this what Kikyo looks like?
Sylvia: [cross] She’s got some bandages on her face. 
Keith: [cross] Huge frilly collar. Did you have the collar?
Jack: Oh yeah, good shout. Massive frilly collar. And she is being accompanied by her daughter, a young girl called Kalluto. 
Keith: This is actually—okay, this is complicated. This is—actually it’s not complicated if you wanna just go by what we get from the manga and the anime. This is Killua’s brother, Kalluto. 
Jack: Oh, Kalluto is Killua’s brother? Okay, cool. 
Keith: Yes. They only ever use he/him pronouns for Kalluto. This gets further complicated later, [Sylvia laughs] but as far as I can tell, there is nothing other—about Kalluto other than that he goes by he/him and is Killua’s brother. 
Jack: Okay. And Kikyo shows up and is pretty much sort of what we had anticipated from the earlier implications about her. She is devoted to her son and also believes that, and she says this a few times, he is at a critical point in his life in which he is sort of destined to rise to the height of the Zoldyck clan and be the best assassin. And she sees all of this business with friends and friendship and any sort of internal personhood other than death to be getting in the way. But all of this is filtered through this very manipulative, sort of, “I’m doing this because I love you and because I love our family” sort of language, unlike Milluki who seems to just be beating up Killua because he is jealous and angry [Keith: Yeah.] [Dre: Mm-hmm.] that—first that Killua attacked him, and second that Killua is afforded a kind of position within the family that he is not. 
Keith: Despite being the younger brother, also. 
Jack: Hm. 
Dre: Hm. 
Sylvia: Yeah, Killua’s like the golden child, right? [Keith: Yeah.] And like—it’s, it’s so—I like [Keith: They po—] positioning him opposite Milluki because Milluki wants that so bad and isn’t it and Killua is like completely either nonplussed or actively like inconvenienced by the status [Keith: Yeah.] that he has within his family as the like heir apparent. 
Keith: Quick thing about—did we mention—Jack you mentioned Kikyo’s visor. Did we say that it’s like a cyborg visor that gives her information-slash-potentially communication all around the property?
Sylvia: She’s got a Zaku eye. 
Ali: Mm-hmm. 
Sylvia: It’s an eye like a Zaku. 
Keith: She does have a Zaku eye. Yeah, she does have a Zaku eye. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Jack: This is also kind of a—a Captain Brnine-type situation, right Ali?  
Ali: Hey. No. 
Keith and Sylvia: [laugh] 
Ali: [cross] Hey, look— [laughs] 
Jack: [cross] It sounds so villain-y, but in the sense of the tool being used here. 
Keith: It’s okay, it’s okay, Jack is—Jack doesn’t know what Dragon Ball Z is. 
Ali: [laughs] Sure, sure. Well, the—yeah—this is like, this is uh, this is like—no, ‘cause this is like a full—this is like a full face mask—it’s not—
Keith: Someone give—someone send Jack a Vegeta from the Saiyan saga. 
Ali: Yeah, you could—you can make eye contact with Brnine through the—the visor. Whereas with this, I think is to make up for a pair of missing eyes? 
Keith: This is—this is what Brnine has. 
Jack: I do not—I do not know. 
Keith: This is the—that is the—
Jack: Oh, sure, sure, sure. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Jack: Yeah, I don’t— 
Ali: [laughs] 
Keith: Uh, this is the—this is the power scouter from [Ali: Uh-huh] Dragon Ball Z. 
Ali: Yeah. Listen to Friends at the Table. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
Jack: [laughs] Yeah, I don’t know what the deal is with Kikyo’s face, but I’m sure we’ll find out. [Keith: Uh—] Did you have something with that, Dre? 
Keith: Oh yeah, Dre, go ahead. 
Dre: Oh no, I was just checking—I was just checking with what you said. 
Keith: So the other thing about Kikyo is like, she seems increasingly unable to contain her emotions. She’s like rapidly sort of like losing her temper and then switching back to a cool and composed and sort of pretending like she didn’t just freak out for two seconds. And uh, the other thing was that, Sylvi you were talking about like Killua being this sort of heir apparent of the Zoldycks and being like the, y’know, the golden child. They do like a lot—they show this in a lot of really interesting ways. The first way is that they have a bunch of different characters say it. They have Milluki say it to Zeno, like they have the grandfather Zeno shows up and is like, “Hey, what’s, y’know—what’s your opinion of Killua?” And Milluki says like, “Well, he’s the best one of us, obviously.” They have Kikyo sort of screeching it all the time. They have—and then they also have like this weird thing where the three generations of head of the Zoldycks all kind of look the same and all of the other ones don’t. It’s very weird. Like it doesn’t—I don’t know what they’re trying to do there. But like, all of the—all of the heads of the family are like—have the same like white hair and blue eyes. [Jack: Yeah.] [Sylvia: Yeah.] Very odd. 
Jack: I’d—I had not put that together. You’re talking about Killua, Killua’s dad, a guy called Silva who we’ll meet later, and then—
Keith: Yeah, handsome Squidward. 
Sylvia: [laughs]
Ali: [snorts]
Jack: Oh yeah, he is handsome Squidward! He is! [Ali: Mmmm.] And then Zeno [pronounced zeh-noh] or Zeno [pronounced zee-noh] the grandfather. Um, but yeah, lemme see. [Keith: Um—] Do we wanna cut back to Gon and crew, or…?
Keith: I would love to do that. Oh did we t—did we—I don’t wanna like, linger on the torturing but was there anything we had to say about this besides that it obviously seems horrible?
Sylvia: Did we mention that Killua’s chained to the ceiling? 
Ali: Mm-hmm. 
Dre: Nooo. 
Keith: Yes, he’s chained—he has his legs and arms in shackles— 
Sylvia: In manacles, yeah. 
Keith: —and is like hanging from his wrists from like either the wall or the ceiling, and is being you know. 
Sylvia: I feel like that’s—
Keith: For d—seeming like for two days minimum is— [Sylvia: Minimum.] is hanging and being whipped. 
Sylvia: ‘Cause you don’t know when he got back after the Hunter Exam, and like [cross] how immediate this was…
Keith: Yeah, [cross] how long…Gon shows up and we—yeah. 
Sylvia: But! Hey. There’s some fucked up shit going on at the Zoldyck estate. 
Keith: Yeah, there sure is. 
Ali: Mmm. 
Keith: Um, and it’s like—
Jack: It’s not good. 
Keith: It’s not good. And it’s even hard to square like, okay, Milluki and the mom like, I can see it. But it becomes like really hard to square—but I think you have to. You have to square the fact that like—the people that it doesn’t seem make sense that they’re letting them do that are letting them do that. You know, when we—when we see the other members of the family and like, “Would these people do that?” Well, it doesn’t matter if it seems like they would or wouldn’t. They do. They did. 
Jack: Mm-hmm! 
Sylvia: It’s like—they at the very least are fine with like letting it happen, right? [Keith: Yeah.] Like I don’t think Illumi’s got any fuckin’ moral objections to this, you know? 
Keith: No. 
Ali: Mm-hmm. 
Keith: Uh—
Ali: Well it’s also just, y’know, this is—this is—these are the people who—who have the buff janitors who [Keith and Sylvia laugh] have the toilet with the really strong door, right? [Dre: Uh-huh. Yeah.] Like, we’re just in—we’re in—we’re in funny mountain town.
Sylvia: Did we talk about that old man’s big muscles that suddenly show up? 
Ali: [cross, laughing] No, we did not talk about when he—
Dre: [cross] No, we have not talked about—
Keith: [cross] ‘Cause he’s—yeah, he’s ripped.
Ali: [cross, laughing] —just took his shirt off and was ripped. [laughs]
Dre: [cross] Him turning into Master Roshi and summoning his aura.
Keith: Yeah. 
Sylvia: Yeah, he’s in the fuckin’ Vin Diesel tank top, he’s fuckin’...
Keith: Yeah. 
Ali: Yeahhhh. 
Dre: [laughs] 
Sylvia: Yoked. 
Keith: Yeah he reveals—oh, I was just wearing a frumpy coat is really what happens. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: He takes off his frumpy coat and is ripped. It’s like, “Of course I’m ripped, I have to open this fourth—four thousand—”
Ali: [laughs] 
Jack: God, that’s so funny. 
Keith: “—4500 pound gate every day.” 
Jack: It’s the shonen equivalent, right, of the bit in the romcom where they take off the girl’s glasses— [Ali and Sylvia laugh] the beautiful Hollywood actress’s glasses and go, “Oh, you’re so beautiful.” 
Sylvia: It’s true! It happens frequently. 
Jack: Except it’s Zebro taking off— [laughs] taking off his jacket [Sylvia: I’m—] and being like, “I am fucking ripped.” 
Sylvia: I mean, straight up, the reason I point that out is it—’cause like we talk about how Hunter x Hunter like draws on different shonen tropes. The old man who is secretly very strong or very buff is like a constant thing. I mean we kinda talked about it with Netero, but I thought it’d be worth [Jack: Yeah.] pointing out that they’re [Keith: Yeah] going back to that well again. 
Jack: Hundred percent. Netero versus Zebro, my money—well—
Sylvia: Well, okay. [laughing] Zebro’s getting—Zebro’s getting put in the skeleton garbage bin. [Ali and Jack laugh] That was another detail actually, was that they just stuffed the—the bones [cross] of the guys who got eaten—
Dre: [laughing] Yeeahhhh!
Keith: [cross] That is literally Zebro’s job. 
Sylvia: —by Mike into the trash. Uh, yeah. Good—good for him, I guess. I hope he has benefits. 
Keith: Uh, the—
Jack: I love Zebro. What a great guy. 
Keith: The other shonen trope that they play with is the heavy house full of heavy things is like, there’s—the trope of the reveal of, “I was wearing weighted clothes and actually I’m stronger and faster.” We get like the other side of that in like a very sort of Hunter x Hunter way. Of like, you know, Jack, this is something you wouldn’t recognize but several famous—several of the most famous scenes in uh, y’know, shonen fight history is like, the uh Princess Bride, “Oh I’m actually not left handed I’m right handed” thing. Have you seen Princess—
Jack: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
Keith: It’s that but it’s like, “Oh I was wearing hundred pound uh, you know, shoes and wrist bands. So I’m gonna take that off and now be much stronger.” We now get the inverse of that which is like, “Here, put these on. Train with these. You’ll be stronger and faster later.”
Jack: Yes. Great. We’re seeing the—seeing the other side of it. 
Keith: Yeah, yeah. 
Sylvia: I put—very famously the Rock Lee one, I think is what pops to mind with a lot of people these days [Keith: Yeah.] [Dre laughs] where he drops his weighted training things and it goes, “Bwooffff….” 
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Keith: Yeah, explodes. It’s great. It’s a great GIF—what a GIF. 
Sylvia: Yeah, shout out. Shout out Naruto. 
Keith: Yeah. And a—and a quick shout out to Naruto! 
Sylvia: Everybody shout out to our friend—friend of the show Naruto. [Dre: Mm-hmm.] Naruto’s my best friend. There we go. [Keith: That’s fine.] Finally resolved it. 
Jack: Um…
Keith: That’s a good—that’s a good second place to—to Gon. 
Sylvia: [quietly] Shut the fuck up. [laughs]
Jack: They open the testing gate in exactly the way that you think they would open the testing gate if you’ve seen any story ever. 
Everyone: [laughs] 
Jack: Which is to say Kurapika and Leorio both try very hard to open it but they can’t until Gon takes off his sling. His arm has healed in seemingly 46 minutes [Ali snorts] and he pushes the gate open with the—
Sylvia: Okay! We do get mul—shots of them spending multiple nights here. 
Ali: Mm-hmm. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Jack: It’s a broken arm! 
Sylvia: So, 48 hours, you know?
Jack: Okay, that’s—mm. 
Keith: [cross] Okay, yeah, it is two or three days. 
Jack: [cross] It’s a broken arm.
Ali: And they had—well they had to get to the country and drive that bus all the way up to the top of the mountain. 
Sylvia: Yeah. He’s young, too, kids heal fast. 
Ali: Yeahhhhh! 
Sylvia: [laughs]
Jack: Hmmmmm. 
Ali: I think I remember them saying like, “Oh you can spend like a week here or two weeks here” or whatever. 
Sylvia: Mmm. That might’ve been a line that didn’t—in the anime or in the manga? 
Ali: Maybe in the manga. 
Sylvia: ‘Cause I don’t—I mean, I wouldn’t be shocked. 
Keith: Yeah, I think the plan was to stay longer but Gon just doesn’t need to—like, the scene where Hisoka’s like, “Hey that poison’ll wear off in a week” and he gets up that…
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: [cross] That’s true. 
Jack: [cross] That’s such a good scene. 
Keith: [cross] …that minute. 
Sylvia: I forgot about that. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Keith: Gon just has super healing powers it’s another…yeah. 
Sylvia: He’s Wolverine. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Jack: Uh, so they—
Keith: The—there’s another long-standing trope of the genre. 
Jack: They head through this little forest and they meet, standing between two sort of stone gate pillars, the apprentice butler who we saw in the flashback earlier when they killed [laughs] like twenty men. 
Sylvia: Like, yeah. 
Jack: Uh, this is a young Black woman with dreadlocks carrying a cane with a yellow orb on the top and we don’t get her name here, but the subtitles reveal that her name is Canary. Uh, this is Canary’s intro, uh, she fuckin’ rules. 
Keith: Yeah, Canary’s the best. 
Sylvia: Canary’s great. 
Dre: Yeah, she’s awesome. 
Jack: Uh, Canary—
Sylvia: Was this the, the half where—where the episodes started clicking for you, was around Canary? Or…? I’m curious now. 
Jack: Yeah. Fully. Uh, well, maybe a little—maybe a little after…
Sylvia: Okay. 
Jack: Hm. It was what happens to Canary at the end of this episode. So, Canary—
Sylvia: Oh, okay! 
Ali: [laughing] Oh, sure! 
Keith: That is a top—that is a top—before—quick before we go on I wanna go back because I forgot something, uh. Uh, during the torture scene it—Killua first learns that Gon shows up, and he has a really nice moment of being extremely determined that Gon definitely will make it to the mansion, which was nice. 
Jack: Oh it’s great. Yup. 
Keith: It totally unnerves his mom. 
Jack: Yeah. Um, so the butlers’ quarters has not given—uh, so. Okay. Canary’s boss is Gotoh, the butler. She is an apprentice butler. The butlers’ quarters have not given the crew permission to enter, so she draws a little line in the dirt with her staff and says that she will remove anybody who crosses the line. Gon says, “We didn’t come here to fight anyone. We just want to see Killua.” Which is very much like—this is similar to what you were saying earlier, I think Keith, about the—calling the butler. Where it’s like, “We make the rules here. We get to decide, y’know, whether you come in or not, whether this is even true or not, we’re the ones deciding it.” Because it doesn’t matter that Gon didn’t come here to fight anyone and just wants to see Killua. You’re on Zoldyck ground here. They are prepared to fight. Y’know, they are stripping away all option for diplomacy or conversation or interiority beyond like warning and consequence and violence. Um, and so having Gon say, “Look. Look, we’re just here. We want to chat.” It’s—it’s very similar to Gon’s encounter with Mike, going, “I don’t think I can actually talk to this person.” But! Gon being Gon, and I think recognizing, perhaps wisely, that Canary is a person and not a 40-foot-tall murderous dog, begins his approach. And this is now just five minutes of Gon getting the shit kicked out of him again, right? It’s—this is—this keeps happening. 
Keith: It’s—it is very quickly back to the Hanzo playbook. 
Jack: Yeah. Uh—
Keith: He learned that this works, “Hey, I could just—I could just make them so uncomfortable [Sylvia laughs] with beating me up that they let me win.” [laughs]
Sylvia: [laughs]
Jack: This is…yeah. What—this is— [sighs] And here’s the thing, this isn’t actually fun to watch a second time [Sylvia: Nooo.] because—I mean it’s not fun obviously ‘cause it’s a character we love getting the shit kicked out of him, but it’s kind of structurally uninteresting as well, ‘cause we know how this works, right? [Sylvia: Yeah.] Gon…Gon just gets you to the point where you go, “Hm. Well I don’t want to kill you.” 
Ali: [laughs] 
Keith: The two interesting things that happen here are the difference in the reaction from [Sylvia wheezes] um…uhhh… [laughs] Thank you, Sylvi. [Sylvia laughs] From Kurapika and Leorio, who were freaking out during the Hanzo fight, right, yep, there we go, get— [Sylvia and Dre laugh] get images in the chat. They, they get this like, super super painted [Dre: Mm-hm.] uh, look, where they’re just like, “No. We’re watching. We are here for this. [Ali laughs] [Dre: Yeah.] We’ve seen how this goes, [Ali snorts] we know the plan, we all are determined. Gon gets beat up and we stand being weird.” And then the other— 
Everyone: [laughs] 
Sylvia: [laughing] What a—oh, “We stand being weird.” 
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: We—the—
Jack: Paradise for freaks. 
Keith: We also get the thing that then Gon points out afterwards, which is like, “The reason I knew this would work is because I could tell that you care about Killua and that you’re not—”
Jack: He says, “You have a heart [Keith: Right, yeah.] unlike Mike.” Which is great that—that to me is even more Mike fuckin’ rules, Mike weird alien dog [Ali and Sylvia laugh] heartless monster. Um, but yeah. He’s like—because we see Canary kind of sweating a little even as she’s standing firm. She says, “Please go away.” The Zoldyck method of, “We’ll just keep hitting you with a stick,” doesn’t really work against Gon, and I think that that is—that’s the show. That’s—y’know. Gon is—Gon is bullheaded with his heart in a way where he’s like, “I can just—I can just barrel through all of this stuff.” This beautiful, sort of elegant melancholy waltz is playing during this whole scene. This is another really interesting piece of music. Um, I can’t tell—and maybe we’ll get into this in the next episode—I don’t know who this theme is attached to. I thought it was attached to the Zoldycks for a while, uh, and sort of like the, um, moneyed majesty of this estate that employs all these butlers and has this very melancholy sort of romantic waltz theme. But it might be attached to Canary? I’m not sure. Because something happens to this waltz as it continues. But then, yeah, Gon punches the brick barrier and says, “When I mentioned Killua’s name you softened for a moment.” And then in just a brilliant, scary moment, Canary suddenly stops and—and begs Gon and crew to save Killua, and then is seemingly just killed. Uh, by a—by a bolt of—a bolt of lightning from offscreen. 
Sylvia: Shot in the head. 
Ali: Mm. 
Keith: Yeah, there is a shotgun, and like a sort of freeze-frame, kind of very stylized black and white still of like, her head clearly being shot and her going down. It is wild. And then it just—episode over. What an ending. 
Jack: As the camera pans to—well, it’s, it’s, it’s great actually. ‘Cause it’s not quite episode over. 
Keith: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Jack: She gets shot. She goes down. The camera pans. The waltz gets cut out and replaced with the Latin Zoldyck chorus [Sylvia: Mm-hmm.] that we heard with Illumi. Except this is a new arrangement of it. It has been written like a—like a classical fugue. Like these overlapping choral parts, rather than Illumi’s big deep chant and the bells, you know. This is—this is this much more sort of mannered, sorrowful arrangement of this theme. And Killua’s mom says, “Oh, she made it sound like we were being mean to Killua,” which is great, as we’ve just intercut [Ali laughs] to him getting beaten up in the dungeon. Uh, and then she relays a message to Gon saying, “Thank you for coming, but I can’t see you right now. I’m sorry.” End of episode. And I thought that was great. I thought all of this stuff was fantastic, with the exception of Gon getting beaten up for six minutes, which—eh, oh, y’know [Ali laughs] that’s probably not the last time I’m gonna see that. 
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: He—
Jack: But Canary was such a cool character and to have this—this great character design show up and then get shot in the head at the end of the episode was—was good uh, uh subverting expectations. 
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: [laughs] Um, something I wanna mention about, uh, just going back to the like, Zoldyck method of just hitting you over and over again a little bit, but also kind of connected to Mike and stuff, is that like, a lot of the stuff that’s going on in the Zoldyck estate is like, either designed to break the spirit of people trying to get in, or condition them to like—I mean we see Seaquant ends up just being someone who works there, I don’t think it’s intentionally set up like that. But it is—this place is either built to train you to be an assassin or break your spirit, and I think that really says a lot about the parenting style of the Zoldyck family. [Jack: [laughs] Mm-hmm!] Um, and also just lets the viewer kind of like, infer a ton of shit about why Killua’s the way Killua is. 
Keith: Mm. 
Jack: Yeah. Totally. Um, anything on 23? 
Sylvia: Um…uh Gon is the dril tweet that reads, [Dre laughs] “Joke’s on you, I actually love being body slammed by one dozen perfect wrestlers, and my mouth isn’t filled with blood it’s victory wine.” 
Everyone: [laughs]
Jack: Oh, it’s so great. Oh, I do actually—so we’ve had two really great character introductions in Kikyo and Canary here, and I wanted to ask about how this is handled in the manga, Ali, and if there are any sort of notable differences between it and the show there. 
Ali: Um, I—well, it just happens really quickly, you don’t get any of the like, flashbacks with um, Killua and uh, br…the apprentice bodyguard. 
Keith: Canary.
Ali: Canary, yeah, and I—
Keith: That is about to happen in 23, yeah. 
Ali: Yeah, and I think that, um— [Keith: 24, sorry.] Like, the—the employee who got beat up and now works there. Like, I believe that entire plotline is just in the show. 
Jack: Oh, huh. 
Ali: [laughing] Like, that guy just—not a character in the manga. At least as far—not as far as I remember. So, it’s really just like—it’s more like monster of the week, or like puzzle of the week, sort of going through them, than it is [Jack: Hmm.] this sort of like, slow considered thing. And I like both versions of it, obviously. I think the—the like focusing on the relationship between Canary and Killua is—is important in the—this sort of structure of the story, of like getting past each of these employees, who like have their own allegiances to the family, you know, and like different ways that they’ll react to that. Um, but yeah, I—there’s like—it’s interesting being on this episode because I do think a lot of this is kind of dry? Like it’s fun character work, and I’m sure a lot of it’s gonna pay off later for like, how you think of Killua, but it’s really just like, oh here’s like a weird—here’s a bunch of freaks. [laughs]
Sylvia: [laughs]
Jack: Here’s a bunch of freaks, yeah. 
Ali: Cause a weird situation. Here’s like—here, y’know, here’s what—here’s what a family of assassins is like in a world where assassins are well-known and a tourist spot. Um, but yeah. It really just feels like, oh this is—this is—this is the gap between getting the gang back together. As it were. 
Jack: Yeah. Which is notable because at the end of this arc, the gang splits apart again. 
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: Yeah, with a little chant. 
Jack: In an extremely funny way [Keith: Yeah.] that we will—we will get to. [Ali and Sylvia laugh] 
Episode 24 [1:08:18]
Jack: Um, as we go into episode 24, I wrote down that I really hoped that we weren’t going to get a plotline that I find so monumentally dull, which is person is conned into believing that other person doesn’t care about them. You see this a lot in like, Disney movies, of like, “Oh the villain makes—makes the hero think that the other hero doesn’t actually like them,” and we have to waste a lot of time as the heroes manage to communicate to each other that that’s not the case. So I was really hoping that we wouldn’t have a, Gon and crew get told that Killua doesn’t actually like them, or Killua gets told that Gon and crew don’t actually like him. We get some hints of that, but ultimately Gon is just a—such a powerful force of like, love, and Killua is so unshakably confident in his friend’s ability to come and find him, that we just bypass that altogether. [Keith: Yeah.] Everybody believes that everybody else is going to find them, and they do. 
Keith: Yeah, they absolutely try to do this, but no one buys it for even one second. And there was no doubt. [Ali laughs] Um, although we do get a little bit of that at the beginning of this episode, of 24, with this flashback. 
Sylvia: I love this flashback. 
Keith: Of when Killua meets Canary for the first time. What a great flashback. I think, start to finish, this was really fun. [Jack: Mm-hmm.] Uh, baby Killua, what, eight years old, out on solo kill missions?
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: Mm-hmm. 
Sylvia: Yeahhh. 
Keith: Uh, comes home, and we get—we get him in a tree eating an apple. Canary shows up and like, they have this, y’know, sort of moment of introduction. We get some lore about a place called Meteor City. [Jack: Mm!] “Meteor City is a city that has been erased from this world,” she says. 
Jack: This is where Canary is from. 
Keith: This is where Canary’s from. This is where she was hired out of to be [Dre: Mm-hmm.] an apprentice butler. You’re allowed—
Sylvia: Hired is—is such—it like—the way they talk about it does make it feel like the butlers just like, snatch up orphans and they are like indentured servants to the Zoldycks. 
Keith: It is true, but Canary is such a badass that it’s hard to— [Ali laughs] it’s hard to imagine her being [Sylvia: Yeah…] snatched. 
Sylvia: I guess. I just—I just thought it’d be worth mentioning that it’s like a little— [Keith: Yeah.] It’s—it’s up to interpretation at the very least. 
Keith: It doesn’t—it doesn’t seem like Meteor City is a good place. It seem—it’s a place [Sylvia: No.] that, like Canary says, “You’re allowed to dump anything there. That’s why so many members of the mafia and the Phantom Troupe come from there.” That’s a weird thing to say. 
Jack: [cross] Bing bing bing! Here comes the Phantom Troupe again! 
Keith: [cross] We know the Phantom Troupe—ring, this is the Phantom Troupe bell. [Dre: Mm-hmm.] So that’s weird. It just seems like this a place that produces like scary, strong people, and that is why Canary is a child, and is like, uh, y’know—they certainly imply that she is like around the same level as Killua, skill-wise. 
Sylvia: I mean, in this flashback, we see later on, her handling a Hunter. Like… 
Keith: Oh, oh, handling a Hunter. 
Sylvia: [with increased emphasis] Like handling a Hunter. Yeah. 
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: They’re actually—those are actually all Hunters. They don’t say this outright, I don’t think, but Seaquant is a hunter. 
Sylvia: Woah! [pause] I know Seaquant is a Hunter and the leader was. We should—we should run through the flashback before we jump ahead too much. 
Keith: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Sylvia: I’m getting ahead of myself. 
Keith: Um—
Jack: Okay. 
Keith: Okay, Jack, go ahead. 
Jack: Killua and Canary talk. Killua notices that Canary has—uses something called the Silent Gait, which is what Killua uses to move silently. And Killua demonstrates Rhythm Echo, which I’ve written down as, “Killua’s horrible way of walking.” [Everyone laughs] The thing we saw— [laughs] the thing we saw him use to kill the um, [Dre laughs] the serial killer. To rip his heart out. And then we saw him spectacularly fail to use against Illumi as Gitturackur. And then because everybody is constantly under the threat of the tyranny of plot moving onwards, 50 men come to attack them. And they show up. Canary fights them. First takes out the crew, and then takes out the boss, who, yes, this is our first confirmed Hunter after the Exam, getting beaten by an eight-year-old? And during this fight Canary uses Rhythm Echo herself. Is revealed to have—
Sylvia: After just being shown it the one time. [Ali: Mm-hmm.] Killua offers to teach it and she just learns it by watching. 
Keith: Uh—
Jack: Uh, no, I think she has known this before, [Keith: Yeah.] [Dre: Yeah.] which is even scarier. 
Sylvia: Oh, okay. 
Jack: The implication is that she—she knew this prior to this point and she was just being polite? 
Dre: Yeah. 
Keith: Yeah, KIllua’s like, “You already knew it,” and she was like, “Yeah, sorry.”
Sylvia: Oh I missed that. 
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: And Killua, immediately, because he’s Killua, starts playing the, “Oh, so you think you’re stronger than me?” game. [Dre: Yeah.] This is eight-year-old Killua’s idea of being friends with someone. [Sylvia laughs] Reveals that he doesn’t have any friends and asks Canary if she wants to be his friend. And it’s very sad. 
Keith: And it’s immediately obvious that she does. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Sylvia: [sadly] It breaks my heart. 
Jack: And she—
Keith: It’s very sad. 
Dre: It’s very sad. 
Jack: But she also notices Kikyo watching from behind a tree as a bootleg version of Prokofiev’s “Dance of the Knights” starts playing? 
Sylvia: [laughs] Yeah. 
Jack: Like, we get like the iconic big opening bass notes of “Dance of the Knights,” that is then replaced by some different Hunter x Hunter music. This is very funny to me. They do this elsewhere in this episode. They play some, um. I have been trying all day to figure out what piece they are pastiching, but it’s another piece of romantic classical music, probably from an opera? I thought it might be Strauss’s Also sprach Zarathustra, but it’s not quite that. It’s like, they are doing a very specific musical reference. And it is fascinating the way that these musical references are being deployed to paint the Zoldyck family inside this kind of musical context of twentieth century—oh sorry, nineteenth century romantic classical music? Very operatic classical music, um, which fits so well with the Zoldycks being like. Deeply wealthy. Deeply mannered. [Keith: Yeah.] But at the same it’s not like they are hiding how violent they are. It’s not like the twist is, “Look, it’s this very wealthy elegant family who secretly under the surface are all murderers.” It’s the even cooler Hunter x Hunter version of that, which is, “Look it’s this very elegant family [Keith: Yeah.] who are extremely open about the fact that they’re bloodthirsty murderers.” 
Keith: Dracula’s on the map, and you can pay ten dollars [Sylvia laughs] to go see him. 
Jack: [laughs] Yeah. You can just go—
Keith: Or at least see his gate. 
Sylvia: It, uh, has the same tone as like—I don’t know if anybody else who lives in a city has experienced these, but true crime tours that people go on? 
Dre: Oh, yeah. 
Jack: Oh yeah, totally. 
Ali: Ohhhhh. 
Sylvia: Which are disgusting. Um… 
Jack: Yes. They are gross as shit. Um, but it’s so much cooler than—hm. I dunno if I’d say it’s cooler. When we met Illumi he was given this, um, eh—and he needed to be to sell that scene. He was given this really doomy heavy ancient choral part. And then seeing that get rendered out and we see the Zoldyck family as a sort of institution into these no less sinister romantic orchestral pieces that still have this very dark, showy tone to them is really, really great composing. 
Keith: Well there’s this like—there’s this like—this thing—this—when they are killing it’s like their job. They’re being hired—they’re being hired to like fulfill another person’s darkness. And they’re obviously also evil and y’know, willing to kill and enthusiastic about killing, and they have their whole little fucked up family cult, um, but they also are a business. They are billionaires, like, easy. [Jack: Yeah. Yeah.] Um, these people—these people are showing up on the like Forbes list of the hundred richest people in the world. Like, Silva Zoldyck is the twelfth richest person. [Ali laughs] Y’know, like. [laughs] Like they have—they’re not just billionaires they’re like deep billionaires—they’re like—they probably have like 150 billion dollars or something crazy. Um, they own this whole region of this country. [laughs] Of the—
Jack: And—and have authority over it. [Keith: Right.] Can kill anybody who enters it. 
Keith: Right, right, yes, yes. They have like—not just—not a lawless space, they have a their law, they have a um—they have—they’re like the—the uh. Shit, what is the—what is the Metal Gear thing where they set up their like, little oil rig country? 
Sylvia: Outer Heaven?
Keith: They have an Outer—yes. They have the Zoldyck Outer Heaven. 
Jack: I don’t—I mean—
Sylvia: I thought you were trying to come up with the name for the Vatican. 
Keith: No. [laughs]
Everyone: [laughs] 
Keith: But it—it kind of is, [Jack: I—] they are like kind of like a pseudo-country. 
Jack: I can’t even get started thinking about this. We’re gonna—there is a line at the end that broke my entire brain about how does this world work. [Sylvia laughs] But we’re—we will—we will get there because Canary notices Kikyo watching from behind a tree. She is noticeably unbandaged at this point. [Sylvia: Mm-hm.] I didn’t know—I’m curious if the—’cause we know that Killua also attacked her when he left. It could be that the bandages on her face are a result of that attack.
Sylvia: I think we got it confirmed that Killua stabbed his mom in the face in an earlier episode. 
Jack: In the face? Okay, that’s cool. [cross] I wasn’t sure where…
Sylvia: [cross] I think—I feel like that got mentioned on the airship during the Hunter Exam. 
Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Dre: Mm. 
Jack: And Canary says, “I can’t—” bwuh, she doesn’t actually say, “I can’t be your friend.” She says something even sadder. She says something like, “I’m very sorry, Killua.” And Killua understands that to mean, “I can’t be your friend.” 
Keith: Yeah, he goes, “Ugh, lame.” 
Jack: Because Canary—yeah Canary is cognizant of the power dynamic in a way that Killua is not. [laughs] Uh, Killua thinks that a power dynamic is a special way for a word of killing someone. 
Keith and Sylvia: [laugh] 
Keith: Yeah, how do you perform power dynamic? How do you do that?
Jack: I want to know. [laughs]
Keith: I want to know. I want to do it. 
Jack: [laughs] 
Sylvia: That’s when he sharpens his nails to pull hearts out. [cross] That’s power dynamic. 
Keith: [cross] I want to make sure that I’m stronger than Go—than Gotoh. By—so that I can do power dynamic. 
Jack: [laughs] Um…and then we just get this smash cut to Gon. We get two stacked smash cuts, a favorite Hunter x Hunter trick. The first is to just Gon saying, “Let’s be friends!” openly, and it’s like [Keith: Yeah.] this is this radiance that Illumi was talking about. Y’know, an open-heartedness, a willingness to be present with someone in that way. And then a second smash cut to Killua, just in the torture chamber, and he looks up and says, [raspily] “Gon…”
Keith: This—this is the like, deep tragedy of these episodes to me. It sort of is the key that will unlock a lot of later stuff. Like, the thing that we see, the—the brilliance Illumi talks about that blinds Killua, the—this sort of like effervescence that Gon has that like, magnetizes all of these people to him, that Killua’s like, interested in and confused by and like, wants to be a part of. Uh, the thing that these episodes, I think, teach is that Killua also has that and his family has spent his whole life [Jack: Mm-hmm!] trying to snuff it. 
Jack: Yeah. Yeah. I agree. 
Keith: Like, everyone around Killua is—cares about him, wants the best for him. The problem is that a lot of those people are horrible villains. [laughs]
Jack: [laughs]
Keith: Uh, but some of those people have—are good-natured, and have, y’know, normal ideas. Um, y’know, maybe Canary is one of those, maybe a couple other people are—we—we’ll talk—we’ll, we’ll get to Gotoh, y’know, sort of maybe being one of these. But like, Zebro definitely, and then obviously also, y’know, all the—all of Gon and his friends. Um…
Jack: Uh, Canary is also a murderous child. [cross] But the children—the role of—yeah. 
Keith: [cross] Yeah, sure, but Meteor City’s a rough place. 
Jack: Children in this show are sort of weird superhumans. [Dre: Yeah!] Everybody is operating at a different level. But I mean, we’ve seen Gon handily fight adults regularly. 
Dre: But here’s—here’s the other thing about it, Jack, that I made this note. Everyone is still seemingly surprised when a child superhero like, beats their ass? 
Jack: Oh, yeah, that’s true. [laughs] 
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: Like—we have seen so many horrible nightmare children. [Jack: Mm.] Like, but like, all these people, especially people who take the Hunter Exam or who are Hunters, are still like, [goon voice]  “Well, you’re just a little kid. I’ll beat the shit outta you.” And then they almost die. 
Jack: [laughs]
Keith: I just it’s, y’know—I just think that um, that we’re in the soup, y’know—it seems like there’s a lot of soup when you’re in the soup. 
Ali: Mmm. Mm-hmm. 
Dre: Mm. Mm-hmm. 
Keith: I—I think it’s not that common that you have a Gon or a Canary or a Killua. I just think that we happen to be in that soup in the—the really strong kids soup. The same thing happens in, y’know, in Dragon Ball, original Dragon Ball. Y’know, we’re following around, y’know ten-year-old Goku and ten-year-old Krillin and uh, y’know, fifteen-year-old Yamcha, and I think, y’know, Tien is somewhere around that age also. Uh, and it’s like, oh, all of these kids and people still are like, [deep, gruff voice] “You’re just a kid.” [Ali laughs] But like—but this whole show is kids that beat the shit out of adults. But I just think that it’s like, yeah they just attract each other. They’re just ma—kids who are superhuman are magnets for other kids that are superhuman. 
Dre: Sure. 
Jack: [laughs] Yeah, it’s true. 
Keith: So it’s just like—I think it’s just one of these, y’know, these suspended disbeliefs that we need to like—like, oh the world is like—we’re seeing a higher percentage of superpowered kids than is really existing. 
Jack: Do we think that somewhere in the world exists that’s like—Cleveland or something. Because like—
Everyone: [laughs] 
Dre: Probably. 
Jack: Because—
Sylvia: What is the Ohio of the Hunter x Hunter universe? Write in to tell us what you think!
Ali: [softly] Wow…
Jack: Yeah, I mean is it—is it—’cause it’s not Whale Island, [Keith: No.] ‘cause that’s where Gon comes from. [cross] It’s not Meteor City, home—
Keith: [cross] It’s probably called like, “Eye-yoh-hoh” or something. 
Jack: Yeah. [laughs] 
Dre: [laughs] 
Sylvia: [laughs] Shut up. 
Jack: It’s—can’t be Meteor City. What’s the other city that begins with a Z we’ve heard about a couple of times?
Sylvia: Oh…um…
Keith: [cross] Oh, I know what you’re talking about. Where the buses were going for the Hunter Exam.
Sylvia: [cross] We went to it early. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Dre: Oh, yeahhhh. 
Jack: I’ve written it down somewhere. Zaban [za-ban] City or Zaban [zuh-BAHN] City. 
Keith: Yeah, yeah, Zaban City, yeah. 
Jack: Um, maybe it’s that. I don’t know. It does—or does everywhere just produce one superpowered child. It’s like “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas” except the kid has a great time and goes on adventures. Every city produces one extremely powerful child. Um, I do not know. Let me see where I am at. [pause] Oh! Great news. [Keith: Yeah.] Canary is not dead. [wheezes]
Keith: Oh, correct. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Jack: For—for some reason. Now, this is just—this is how you make a television show. I understand that it is fun to have a cliffhanger of [Ali laughs] making a character look like they were absolutely obliterated [Ali: Mmm.] and then return. I don’t understand why Kikyo didn’t kill her. 
Keith: Um—
Sylvia: I mean she’s pretty good at her job otherwise, [laughs] y’know?
Jack: [laughing] Yes, that’s true. 
Keith: I think there’s a lot of investment that like—in a like, sort of literal way. [Dre: Yeah.] In each of these butlers. 
Ali: Mm-hmm. 
Jack: Yeah. I mean—I mean. Fair enough. She did just beg them to rescue Killua from the family. Um, and so I—I don’t know. [Keith: Yeah.] The impression that you get is—
Keith: [cross] I think at this point she’s so confident that it won’t happen. 
Jack: That’s true. Yeah. 
Keith: Because the interference hasn’t happened yet. 
Ali: Right. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Ali: And what she’s doing is just trying to stop the plea. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Ali: Rather than—
Jack: Oh she’s trying to say—it’s essentially her saying, “Stop talking.”
Ali: Uh-huh. 
Keith: Yeah, “Shut up.” Yeah. Yeah, this is a shut up smack, y’know, [Ali: Uh-huh.] you shoot someone in the head lightly. 
Jack: A great animation. 
Sylvia: Again, that makes perfect sense for the Zoldyck family—
Dre: [cross] Uh-huh. 
Jack: [cross] It really does. 
Sylvia: [cross] —that their “shut up” is a bullet to the head. 
Jack: Uh, from her fan. Uh, she shoots this kind of glowing bolt, and when we cut back to her, she’s hold her fan, and the tip of it is glowing and smoking. Which is like, no normal weapons—well that’s not true. Leorio has a knife. Just a—
Sylvia: [laughs]
Dre: Just a knife! 
Jack: Uh, so they’re uh—Leorio, who, again we are reminded, in a sudden jolt of horror that this man is a doctor, or wants to be a doctor, is like, [Dre laughs] “She’s fine, she’s not actually unconscious,” as we cut back to Killua, who effortlessly—so Milluki sort of is—is continuing [Sylvia: Augh.] [Keith: Yeah.] to torture Killua, augh, does you want to talk about this, Sylvi? [cross] This is fucking great. 
Keith: [cross] This is—this is the Addams Family twist of the episode. 
Sylvia: The best—this is great. Uh, Milluki sucks. 
Keith: Yeah, he sucks. 
Sylvia: What he says—we cut back to him torturing Killua, and he says something like—we—something about killing Gon and Killua’s friend—Killua’s other friends, I believe. Um. 
Keith: Uh, can I rewind real quick [Sylvia: Yeah!] to the—to the thing that sets Milluki off to say that is…Killua pretends to apologize. [Sylvia: Right.] He goes like, [in a snotty, high-pitched voice] “Good morning, bro, I’m so sorry about stabbing you.” 
Sylvia: [laughs uproariously]
Keith: [still in the snotty voice] “I’m so sorry about stabbing you bro.” 
Sylvia: Yeah, and then, um—right. And then he gets a phone call. Milluki gets a phone call from their mom about how Gon—um, not Gon, about how Killua’s friends are here and near the butlers’ office. And then he says like, um. He threatens them in some way, and Killua pulls his chain off the wall. Just effortlessly, rips one of his hands down, [Jack: Mm-hmm.] the chain just clatters, and he’s like, “Hey, if you touch any of them, I’ll kill you.” And I—
Keith: With a crazy look on his face! 
Ali: [laughs] 
Sylvia: It’s—it’s great. I mean does the—it’s—it’s, yeah. It is the most killing intent we have ever seen from Killua. [Keith: Yeah.] [Dre: Mm-hmm.] It is fantastic. 
Keith: Yeah, ‘cause everyone else he’s killed he’s barely emoted at all. [Ali: Mm-hmm.] [Jack: Mm-hmm.] He’s mostly been bored all of his other murders that we’ve seen.
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Sylvia: He—he goes into that sort of like, almost trance-like state with some of them and then—I mean with—with the guy in Trick Tower he had some fun with it, [cross] but with Bodoro—
Keith: [cross] Yeah, he was sort of showing off, he was like playing it cool. 
Sylvia: Yeah. I guess with Bodoro there’s the implication [Keith: Yeah.] that he was hypnotized as well. 
Keith: And there was—but there was the other two in the airship that he was like, [snotty voice] “You’re in my way, stop it.” Gerk! 
Sylvia: Oh yeah. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Sylvia: Um. What happens next is there’s like a brief conversation between Kikyo and our crew, where she like introduces herself and says—like, she’s basically trying to dissuade them and saying like, “Killua doesn’t wanna see you.” And suddenly she’s like—I believe the exact words in my subtitles were, “Papa, what are you doing? Oh no!” [Ali and Keith laugh] and she like—her like—her like visor like freaks out a little bit, and she just like, runs off and like—Kalluto has to follow after her. 
Keith: Yeah, this is the thing about the visor that I don’t— I don’t—they don’t ever say how it works like— [Sylvia: No.] Does she have live [Dre: Mm-hmm.] feeds of all over the place that she’s like watching? [Sylvia: That—] Are people communicating directly with her?
Sylvia: That—that’s kind of my assumption is that beca—
Dre: There’s—there’s a much easier answer to this. 
Keith: Yeah? 
Dre: And that’s that she’s a Zaku. 
Ali: Mm. 
Jack: What is a Zaku? 
Ali: [gasps]
Sylvia: From Guuundam. 
Dre: It’s from Guuuundam. 
Keith: So I—
Dre: They have—they’ve got the mono-eye thing that does—that does the exact same thing hers does, where it’s just like the eye goes back and forth across the visor. 
Sylvia: [cross] I’m getting an image for you, Jack. 
Keith: [cross] But she—she’s like getting information from other places that she is not at. 
Dre: Sure. 
Sylvia: Yeah, the—so, she has like a little, she has like some antennas and stuff on her visor. Um, I just—this was, to me, like confirmation that like, there’s like a security system of some kind that her visor’s hooked into. [Keith: Yeah.] I feel like—like—I’d need to like look through and see if there are any cameras in the background of shots, [Keith: Yeah, like that’s the—] but it’s not a stretch to believe it. 
Keith: It is not a stretch to believe it, but—but she sounds so much like she’s talking to people, like when she’s like, “Papa, don’t, [Sylvia: Yeah.] stop it, we talked about this, we did talk about this!” Like it sounds like she’s talking to Zeno, but [Sylvia: To be fair—] no one ever makes any act like they’re talking to her. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Sylvia: That’s true. There is—I—we talked about her being kind of like, she goes from zero to a hundred with all of her emotions. [Keith: Yeah.] And that could easily be interpreted as her just like talking to what she sees on her screen as well—
Keith: Yeah, I—that’s sort of what I—
Sylvia: That sort of like, “Don’t go in there when you’re watching a horror movie”-type [Keith: Right.] thing, except it’s her father-in-law and, um, [laughs] her son is the monster she doesn’t want him to go see. Um, we do—does someone else wanna ta—I can keep going with the conversation between Zeno and Killua, uh—
Keith: Did anyone’s—’cause this is the first time I’ve seen this actually translated. Did anyone else’s sub [Sylvia: Oh.] say what [Sylvia: Uh-huh.] Zeno’s shirt says? 
Jack and Sylvia: Yes. 
Keith: Because mine has never said it [Dre: Oh, yes!] before, so I’ve never read it. [Dre: Mm-hmm.] He’s wearing this like, cloak with um—I don’t know how to describe it other than like, like he’s got like the thing that priests wear during Lent. The like uh—you know what I’m talking about? Like…
Sylvia: I do know what you mean, but uh…
Dre: I saw a—a stole is the wrong word. [Keith: Um.] I know exactly what you’re talking about. 
Keith: It’s uh—it is—it is the—a stole. It is like a stole. But it’s like—
Dre: Is it? Okay. 
Keith: But it’s like, instead of— 
Sylvia: It’s like a sign as well. 
Keith: Yeah, yeah. Instead of like, being like a scarf with one on each side, it like, goes through his head. Anyway, it just looks very priestly to me. [Dre: Mm-hmm. ] But on it, it has some words that I had never seen translated, and it just says, it says, “One kill per day.” 
Everyone: [laughs]
Keith: [cross] It’s just so outrageous! 
Dre: I feel like mine said like, “One murder a day,” but—
Keith: Oh really?
Ali: Wooooow. 
Keith: [cross] Mine said, “One kill per day.”
Sylvia: [cross] Mine said, “One kill per day,” as well. 
Dre: Kill? Okay. I might be misremembering. 
Sylvia: No—
Keith: I mean, I bet all those kills are murders. 
Dre: [laughs] Yeah, potato potahto! 
Sylvia: [cross] Yeah, it probably is—you can probably translate it both ways is the thing, right? [Dre: Yeah.] One of those like, discretion of the subtitlers. Um—
Jack: Cut back to that TV program about the Zoldyck family, and it’s like, “The Zoldyck patriarch Zeno has an unusual philosophy. [Dre laughs] As written on his shirt, ‘one kill a day.’” This is—this is the grandpa and he shows up and is like, “Look. Killua. You can go.” And then what does Killua do? [laughs]
Keith: He—he just rips ‘em all off, [Sylvia laughs] [Dre: Uh-huh.] he just goes. He’s like, “Oh, this was nothing to me the whole time.” Uh, does anybody have what he says to Milluki?
Sylvia: He says, uh, I believe it is, “By the way, I’m not sorry. I felt kinda bad though, so that’s why I let you hit me for so long.” [Dre laughs uproariously] Something along those lines. 
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: Yeah, this is the—this is where it reveals like, all of the weight of the last episode, like seeing the horrible violence that they were doing to this twelve-year-old, this episode is like, “Haha, it’s the Addams Family.” Like, they—he doesn’t even care. This is Wednesday Addams beating up on Pugsley, and Pugsley’s like. Shrugs. Shrug of like—it’s like—
Sylvia: Yeah. Yeah. It really is! 
Keith: Yeah. Uh…
Dre: Yeah. 
Keith: Uh, I looked it up, by the way. Zeno’s shirt is different than I had in my—in my head, which is not uncommon for me. [Sylvia laughs] He’s wearing a—he’s wearing like a purple vest over a white shirt with a metal, a huge metal gold collar. [cross] And I what thought—what I thought was—
Sylvia: [cross] The collar is crazy. 
Dre: [cross] The collar is sick. 
Keith: [cross] —was a—like a scarf is actually just a paper sign that is like, affixed to the front of the shirt. And that sign—that paper sign says, “One kill per day.”
Dre: One kill per day. 
Ali: [laughs] 
Keith: Yeah. [laughs]
Keith: Uh—
Jack: Maybe it’s fashion. Maybe it’s streetwear. 
Keith: I think it is fashion, yeah. 
Sylvia: This is—
Jack: I’m wearing a shirt right now that says, “Worship the old gods Sin Eater” on it. [Ali: Mmm.] So if I were in Hunter x Hunter and you saw me wearing that shirt, you’d be like, “Wow.” 
Sylvia: “Who are the old gods?”
Jack: “Who are the old gods?”
Sylvia: But it’s actually just a band that Zeno really likes. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Sylvia: He’s just really into—he’s really into hardcore. 
Dre: [laughs]
Jack: Yeah. Um. And he sends him off saying, “You should go talk to your dad.” Or rather, “Your dad wants to see you.” [Sylvia: Yeah.] And Killua’s like, “Huh. Okay.” Then we get a single tiny—just an extremely funny scene between—we get what starts out as an exposition scene between Milluki and Zeno and turns into basically a Coen brothers joke? Or a—a Wes Anderson joke, maybe. [Dre laughs] The conversation goes like this. Milluki thinks Zeno spoils Killua. Zeno says, “Oh it’s because he is special,” and Milluki agrees. Although he says, “So he might be the most talented Zoldyck assassin in the history of our family, but he is too erratic. He’s a kid who wants to go and make friends, he could never lead the Zoldyck family.” And he pauses, and then he says, “Unlike me.” And this is when it transforms into a Coen brothers or Wes Anderson gag, because he says, basically, “I want to be the boss, Grandpa. I’ve built a new bomb. [Ali laughs] My bomb is so small [Dre laughs] that I can attach it to a mosquito and the bomb will go with the mosquito, and then when the person gets bitten the bomb will go off. But it’s kind of tricky because it’s hard to target someone with a single individual mosquito.” And then we just cut out of the scene. [Dre laughs] No reaction. [laughs]
Keith: Oh, no, no, Zeno does say like, [Sylvia: No, he—] “You’re too—you’re smart, but you’re foolish.” 
Jack: Oh, right, he’s—
Dre: I—I quoted this. [Keith: Okay, good.] He says, this is the English dub, “You’re a sharp boy, but that doesn’t mean you’re not an idiot too.” 
Keith and Sylvia: [laugh]
Keith: There are also a couple other interesting little bits—
Sylvia: That’s a—that’s fuckin’ Succession scene. 
Keith and Ali: [laugh]
Dre: Yeah! 
Keith: Hey, they’re—the Zoldycks are a Succession family. 
Sylvia: Oh no, absolutely!
Ali: Ohhhhh. 
Keith: Yeah, uh, there is a great—there’s a couple little good bits to this conversation also. The first thing is how easily Milluki admits, “I understand why you treat him better than you treat me, because he is better than me.”
Jack: “He is good.”
Keith: “But! That doesn’t mean that he should be the boss.” And the other thing is that his evidence that he should be in charge is like, “I’ll kill anyone you want me to. I’ll—I’ll kill anyone you ask me to without any problems. Killua’s always complaining like, when you tell him to kill people.” And this was sort of when I had the thought, like, that, y’know, we know that they’re training Killua to take over the family. The thing that they’re training the other Zoldycks to do is to be Mike. They’re training them to be the heartless killing machine, [Jack: Mmm.] as close to that dog as you can get but still go out and do the missions. And this is what Milluki doesn’t understand. It’s actually the fact that you will kill whoever they tell you to without complaining that is the exact reason you couldn’t be in charge. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Keith: Um…
Jack: Yeah, and we—and we get a real sense of that in action when we meet Killua’s dad. 
Keith: Yes, totally. A hundred percent. Uh, does anybody wanna talk about handsome Squidward? 
Ali: [snorts]
Sylvia: Um, real quick, do we—when do we get the scene where Kall—there’s like a brief scene where the—where Kalluto like, interacts with Gon and the crew [Keith: That was—] and says something about—
Keith: That was between—that was when—when Kikyo leaves after the Canary shooting. Kalluto hangs back and like, asks them a question, and then runs off. 
Sylvia: Yeah, she’s like, “Who are you?” And they say, “We’re Killua’s friends.” And he just kinda goes, “Friends?” and then that’s when Kalluto gets called away. And it’s a real moment of like, oh, this—could this kid also get Killua’d about friends—
Keith: Yeah, he’s learning about friends for the first time. 
Sylvia: Yeah, like is this—did Gon just like plant the seed for another like Zoldyck child to stray from the family path? Which I just wanted to mention. 
Jack: Mm. Mm-hmm. 
Sylvia: Um…
Jack: Puzzled by the idea that you could have friends. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Keith: Or want them, maybe? Maybe that’s what it is? We don’t get—we don’t get a lot of information—
Sylvia: We don’t get much. 
Keith: —about what he’s thinking. We do get a lot of curiosity, like—
Jack: Has he had any dialogue? Like, spoken—spoken dialogue?
Keith: That was his only dialogue. 
Sylvia: That was pretty much it, yeah. 
Keith: Uh, I think maybe he responds to something that Kikyo says like one other time, maybe. But year, this—this was uh, Kalluto’s only—only real dialogue. Just a lot of like curious and interested spying. And then that. And then following the mom around a lot. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Keith: Uh, this Silva conversation is so bizarre. 
Sylvia: It’s—ah, it’s so much. I feel—there’s like a look on—so, when Killua gets there, Silva’s like, “Hey, tell me about your friends.” And the face that Killua makes is like, the first time his dad’s ever had any interest in like, anything about him. 
Keith: Killua clearly is like, in awe of his father [Sylvia: Mm-hmm.] in a way that is so different from anyone else that we’ve seen him interact with in his family. And when we see them interacting, like Silva see—he’s intense, but he seems like, nice in a way that is totally off-putting. [Sylvia: Yeah!] And like very surprising. [Ali snorts] Where it’s just like—all we see all of this bizarre from all of these absolute weirdos. We open the door and we see Silva who is a monster of a guy—
Sylvia: Handsome Squidward. 
Keith: —sitting—a monster—yeah, he’s handsome Squidward. 
Sylvia: He’s a monster of a Squidward. 
Ali: Mmm. 
Keith: [laughs] Sitting next to him is like a mini Mike, who’s like got—got his like muzzle restrained with like a metal—like, this is clearly, y’know, someone’s biting people, so. 
Sylvia: This room that he’s in also, has a real, like—the background feels very like—it’s got the like same sort of piping that you see in like, Giger artwork or like Tsutomu Nihei’s work. 
Keith: Oh, sure. 
Sylvia: Um, which like, just adds to the atmosphere. Killua sits in this real weird lookin’ chair. Um, like everything about this place feels like this isn’t a nice room. This room isn’t used for nice things. [Jack: Mm.] Um. [Keith: Uh, yeah.] And it’s—it really offsets him being like, “You can tell me everything about the Exam!” 
Keith: And he does, seemingly. 
Jack: It’s a really strange—really strange. 
Sylvia: Yeah, what did you think? What was your first impression of this, Jack?
Jack: I mean, I am basically in the business of being wrongfooted by Hunter x Hunter, [Sylvia: Mm-hmm.] so I—I. I went into it being like, oh this is a work. You know, he is building [Sylvia laughs] up to a kind of uh, moment of violence or domination in which he, you know, shreds this up, and kind of—this is very similar to the way you described this happening in previous episodes, right Keith, where it’s like I’m kind of right but not—not in the exact way that I thought I was going to be. [Keith: Mm-hmm.] Because that moment never really comes. Instead we get this conversation that is deeply unsettling because of how, on the face of it, mundane it is on so many levels. This really is the coming home from school, how was your day son-type conversation. He asks about his friends and Killua says, “They’re a lot of fun to be with.” And then he asks about the Exam, and, “You can tell me anything and everything.” And then they’re just having a fun time when we cut back to them in a bit, um, we hear that, you know, they’re chuckling about like, “Oh and then, haha, Hanzo said he was gonna cut his legs off! [Keith laughs] Gon—Gon wouldn’t let him cut his legs off!” [Sylvia wheezes] And the subtitle says, “Both chuckling,” as the two of them [Ali laughs] think about this. 
Keith: Yeah, I thought it was really funny—my sub—
Sylvia: To be—he probably thought that was actually pretty funny. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Keith: My sub was like, uh, was like, uh, explaining the Hanzo thing, and then Killua’s like, “Gon’s so self-centered!” and then bursts out laughing. [Jack and Dre laugh] It’s such an odd view of that—of what happened there. [laughs] I don’t know, maybe that’s like weird—a weird translation, or I don’t know what the dub said, but. [Jack: Yeah.] The read of that situation of—as Gon being self-centered is really funny. 
Jack: And then we get to a moment where it could—
Keith: And not a hundred percent wrong. 
Ali: Mm. 
Jack: No, not really. You get to a moment where it could start getting sinister, but instead it just stays strange. When Silva asks, “Do you want to see your friends? Be honest. There is no need to hold back with me.” And he says that they’ve never had a father-son chat before. 
Sylvia: Yeah. I just got that screencap [cross] that’s like confirmed, it’s the first time. 
Keith: [cross] Yeah, that’s such—I also wrote that down. And it is such a bizarre thi—’cause it felt natural. 
Jack: He says—there is an ease to this conversation that is—that is bizarre. He says— [Dre: Mm-hmm.] Well, and in part because the things he’s saying is things the viewer is putting to getting, and the viewer is thinking about Killua. He says, “I was raised by my parents to be an assassin, and I raised you the same way.” Beat. “But you and I are different and you leaving home has helped me realize that. You are my son and a person all on your own.” And I’m like, oh I’m narrowing my eyes. I don’t know about this. So he asks again, “Do you want to see your friends?” Killua says yes. And Silva lets him go, but makes him make a promise. He bites his thumb so that it draws blood and he says, “You must promise never to betray your friends.” And Killua bits his thumb, and they put their fingers together in exactly the same gesture that we saw Gon do with Aunt Mito back in episode one, except this time there is blood involved, whereas before, it was just a boy and his aunt pressing their thumbs together. Which is—that’s the Zoldyck family through and through! [Dre: Mm-hmm.] Uh, and then Killua just gets ready to leave. Silva lets him go. He has a brief uh, sort of, run-in with his mum, who, like we said earlier, claims that the three have already left without him. “Oh, they don’t care about you, Killua.” Nope. Killua doesn’t buy it. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: There i—okay. I need to talk a little bit about Killua interacting with his mom, because I wrote—I wrote multiple times in my notes, that, especially when the flashbacks, that Killua kinda has some Stewie Griffin vibes. 
Ali: Oh, sure. 
Jack: Say more about this. 
Sylvia: Uh, well, so he wants to kill his mother. The—and Lois—Stewie famously [Ali laughs] wants to kill Lois. Um, so I wrote down that him—when he met her in the hallway and sort of intimated that he would kill her if she tried to stop him that it was a “Damn you vile woman” moment. [Jack laughs] And I just kinda wanted to put that out there. I also think that it’s really good that she gets so fucking proud that—or like excited when Killua like threatens her. Just another point in the like, this family is full of freaks [laughs] column! 
Keith: It’s—it’s so—bizarre because they’re all terrible and we know that Silva is terrible, we just haven’t seen it. Well we see him being awful to the—to his wife. [Sylvia: Yes.] So that is one. And like, y’know, like, in it—in a way that is like—the—she’s awful, but like, so is he, so why is he so upset that she’s being awful, he’s awful too. [Sylvia: Yeah.] And—and then we get—we do get some of that sinister—we get the—the peel back of the conversion with Killua a little bit. He has like this sinister laugh of like, “Oh, he’ll come back.” And it’s like, oh I don’t know. I don’t know. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Sylvia: I mean, to contrast what he says to Killua’s face, which is like, that we’re different, is he says, “He’s my son after all.” Like—that—like, I think it’s really good that they establish that Silva—I dunno. It makes you think about the fact that assassins have to be social creatures as well, in a way. [Keith: It is—] Like they have to be able to talk their way into things. 
Keith: Yes, I was—yeah. This is totally, like this—his ability to go Killua’s whole life without ever having this kind of talk with him. To immediately slide into it in a comfortable and familiar way that puts Killua at ease is an assassin’s mask. Like this is a disguise. 
Jack: This is where it becomes scary. 
Keith: Yeah. And—and it’s actually like, it’s a return to the status quo when he leaves and is like, “Mwahaha.” [laughs] [Jack: Yeah] Like oh finally, here is the Silva that I kind of expected. But we don’t get a lot of it and—and in fact I think that his play is such a long play we’re not gonna—I don’t think we’re gonna fully understand how or like what—what Silva meant by this conversation for like sixty episodes or something. Um. 
Jack: Yeah, there was a lot going on there, I think. 
Keith: Yeah, there really was. Yeah. 
Jack: That is not terribly clear. It’s a fool’s game to make predictions based on this, but I feel the—between the blood promise “don’t betray your friends,” “he’s my son after all, he’ll come back” we’re playing in the space of what Illumi said to Killua about like, “Oh you’re wondering what it would be like to kill Gon.” And all the pieces that are in place for us to work toward [Keith: Right. Yeah.] some kind of configuration of Killua is going to be asked to harm his friends and that is going to play into Silva’s hands. But, you know, knowing Hunter x Hunter it’s gonna be—it’s—the way that is gonna be configured is gonna be really weird. Uh—
Keith: The—you, you can see the—you can see the track that Silva wants to lay by—he says, y’know, the thing he says when he goes is, “He’ll come back, he’s my son, like, he has to come back.” But then what he says to Killua’s face is, “Come home when you’re tired. [Jack: Mmm.] Y’know, come home when you’re ready to come home.” But then the—the only bit of leverage he has is a blood promise to never betray your friends. [Jack: Mm-hmm!] Um, so you can see like—you can see the way that this is so—is like not an innocent thing. But then the flip side of it is I do think that Silva means it when he says, “The way that Killua can become the leader of the Zoldycks in the way that he needs to be is by becoming a full person outside of Kukuroo Mountain.” Like, I don’t— [Dre: Mmm.] I don’t think that—I do think that there’s a—there’s a—a way for that to be a good plan. [Jack: Yeah.] Because what is not gonna work is having Killua trapped on the mountain resenting his whole family and the family business, and then being like an adult who has nothing but disdain for his family, has the willpower to resist being broken by them, and no desire to kill anyone. And it’s like, oh, you know, probably should’ve let him go with his friends 20 years ago, huh? 
Jack and Ali: [laugh] 
Jack: Um, I think the only other bit of business for me this episode is that Canary has come ‘round and she has offered to lead the crew to the butlers’ quarters, where she can’t guarantee that they will be able to see Killua, but they are able to get a lot closer to the house that way. 
Episode 25 [1:50:41] 
Ali: And, boy are they in the butlers’ quarters. [snorts] 
Sylvia: Oh, yeah. 
Jack: Yeah. You wanna tell us about the butlers’ quarters, Ali? 
Ali: Um, well, okay so this is just a normal—all intents and purposes this is a building with normal cups and normal—normal chairs—
Sylvia: [laughs]
Keith: Yeah, nothing’s heavy here. [laughs]
Ali: Nothing’s heavy here. But I guess you don’t know, ‘cause all the—all the butlers need to be trained assassins, so who knows. But, the vibes are really bad because the butler, one of the butlers at least, is very upset that the matron of the house is upset. 
Sylvia: Yo. 
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: Man, that—got some feelings there, Gotoh? 
Ali: [laughs] 
Sylvia: What’s up, man? 
Dre: [laughs] 
Ali: “Mistress’s voice was barely above a whisper.” [Jack: Mmm.] [Sylvia: Yo.] He—he can’t stand to look into their faces because they made her upset. Um, and the way that he—
Keith: I’ll say—I’ll say—I—I think that that was part of the—of the ruse. 
Ali: You think that’s part of a ruse?
Keith: Yeah, I think that’s part of the ruse. 
Ali: You don’t think that he’s just like—a like, a fiercely, um, loyal—
Sylvia: I think he loves Lois Zoldyck. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Keith: I don’t think he does. I don’t think he does. 
Sylvia: [laughs]
Ali: Really?
Keith: Yeah. I don’t think so. 
Ali: Uh, well—hm—
Keith: I think—I think that the—I think that the person he’s trying to protect is Killua here. I don’t think that he loves—
Sylvia: I can see that. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Keith: Yeah. That is my read on it. Y’know, uh, y’know, maybe there’s—there’ll be a little bit more here at another date. Um, but, y’know, I don’t—I don’t think that I can prove that I’m right. I just get the vibe that that was a ruse. 
Sylvia: I mean, I don’t think we can prove that you’re wrong, either. [Ali: Mm-hmm.] I don’t think that’s like a [Ali laughs] bad way to read this episode at all. I think that adds like, some interesting layers to Gotoh. I just assumed he was horny for Mrs. Zoldyck. [Keith laughs] [Ali: Yeah.] I just assumed he’s in the—he’s in the—the butler house pacing all day thinking about her visor, you know? 
Ali: Yeahhhh. 
Jack: [laughs] 
Ali: Anyway, the way that he emotionally deals with this is by challenging them to a weird coin game? 
Keith and Sylvia: [laugh] 
Jack: Oh my god. 
Ali: “I’m gonna throw this coin back and forth and you have to guess which hand it’s in.”
Keith: He’s going to judge them based on a test of his own devise. 
Ali: Yeah, y’know. 
Jack: Yes, he says, “I’m gonna judge you based on a test of my own devising.” And the test is just flipping a coin and trying—well, hm. 
Sylvia: Hm. 
Keith: It is—it is—
Jack: Well, so first he—
Keith: It is metaphorically a test about being able to see deceit in the world. That is the—that is what the test is supposed to do. 
Jack: Oh, so firstly they take Canary hostage, they say, “If you get this—if you try and mess with me, or you don’t answer in three seconds, I’m going to cut her throat.” Uh, and everyone’s like, “All right. Sound’s good. What’s the game?” [Ali laughs] I wrote down, “Is this going to be a Killua quiz?” ‘Cause the implication is that he’s gonna ask questions, but the question he asks is the same every time, and it’s, “What hand is the coin in?” [Keith laughs] Then he tosses the coin and just sort of catches it quite quickly, and is like, “Which hand’s it in?” And then he—he—
Keith: A rare example of a question that’s the same question gets harder every time. 
Jack: Harder every time. Because what he does is it’s like—he does—it’s like out of fucking Looney Tunes or something. He tosses the coin and then just goes like, [makes whooshing noises]. 
Sylvia and Ali: [laugh] 
Keith: Very accurate, yeah. 
Jack: With his hands a bazillion times. And then—and then eventually some more butlers arrive and they all do the hand business and uh, you know, it’s—it’s—it is what it is. [Keith: Uh, I—] I was really hoping we would get a Killu—uh, a Kurapika PowerPoint explaining how to win this game, [Sylvia laughs] but we do not. 
Keith: We—well, we—
Sylvia: We get a little one later. 
Keith: We do get it after the game’s over. Um, uh—
Jack: Yeah. 
Keith: But we—we get a great little Kurapika—sorry, Gon bit here. Uh, quote, “Leorio, give me your knife. Don’t worry, I won’t do anything stupid.” And then proceeds to slice his own eyelid. 
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: Hey, he had to be—he needed a cut man. Y’know?
Sylvia: I got—I went fucking crazy for that, [cross] not gonna lie, that was badass. 
Dre: [cross] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Ali: [cross] It was. 
Keith: It was, but it’s just so funny like, “Don’t worry, I’m not gonna do anything crazy.” And then, [makes a knife slicing noise] 
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: Gon’s favorite movie is Rocky because he—his—all his heroes just like him have CTE. 
Ali: Mmm. 
Keith and Dre: [laugh]
Jack: Oh. I, uh—but they—they get through this as the game gets more and more tricksy and more and more deceitful but eventually Killua, who has been in a room in the butlers’ quarters, playing with like 500 identical robot toys? 
Keith: [laughs]
Sylvia: Eatin’ candy, yeah. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 
Jack: Eatin’ candy. Uh, comes in and is like, “Hey, what’s going on here?” And the—
Keith: This is so good!
Jack: —the mood—it is so funny. The mood changes to a celebration instantly. Everyone’s like, “I’m so happy to see you. This is fantastic. This is great.” Killua says, basically like, “Were they trying to mess with you? Did they try anything?” And Gon says, “Nope! They were just keeping us all entertained.” [Ali and Keith laugh] At no point during this scene do we cut to Canary, [Sylvia: Yeah!] a woman with a knife to her throat. [Dre: Uh-huh.] Gon is convinced—I—I can’t tell—is Gon saying this just so Killua doesn’t feel bad about his family, or do you think Gon—
Keith: I think so. 
Jack: —no. No, yes, ‘cause Gon saw them take that woman hostage. 
Keith: Right. Yeah, I—I think—I think that—that Gotoh convinced—he passed the game and Gotoh kept his end of the deal and let Canary go, and I think that that was just—I think that Gon was like, “Well, we don’t need to bring this up. I think we can just pretend like everything’s cool.” 
Dre: Y’know, yeah, why talk about old stuff? 
Keith: You did skip I think the best line in the whole show so far, Jack. 
Jack: Which was that?
Dre: Uh-huh? 
Keith: Does anyone have it? I have it, if anyone doesn’t know what I’m talking about. 
Sylvia: Keith, please, tell us the best line in the show so far. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Keith: “You’re here! Gon! And…this guy! Uh, Kurapika? [Jack laughs] And…Reolio!” 
Everyone: [laughs]
Jack: Yes! Is this in the manga, Ali? 
Ali: Um, no, I don’t recall this gag. 
Jack: It’s so fucking good. 
Keith: It’s so funny. 
Dre: It’s a great gag. 
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: Yeah, during the—during this, you know, he says, he says, “This guy! Uh, Kurapika!” and then Kurapika goes, “You forgot already?” [Ali snorts and laughs] And he says, “Reolio,” and Leorio’s like, [angrily] “IT’S LEORIO!” 
Ali: [laughs] 
Jack: It’s so funny. 
Keith: It’s so funny. It is really a peek into Killua’s mind, which is just like, a big thought bubble that says, “Gon.” 
Ali: Mm-hmm. 
Dre: Uh-huh. 
Jack: Yeah, it’s a big thought bubble that says, “Gon,” and then on the outside of the thought bubble it is just an endless fathomless panel of knives, guns, [Keith laughs] someone getting blown up, someone getting hit by a car. And then in the middle it’s him going, “Gon!” [Keith laughs] I love Killua. 
Keith: [softly, laughing] “Reolio…”
Jack: Oh, also notable—Reolio—it, when you talked about how the, uh—Zeno, Silva, and Killua all look the same, um, Silva has the same color palette that Gon does. He has this purple—oh sorry, he has this blue and white and grey color palette, whereas Kikyo, Killua’s mother, has a purple color palette. And I think that going into that room with Silva and the colors just matching up exactly kind of like snapped together a lot of, you know, this is the heir apparent to the Zoldyck empire. 
Keith: Yeah. Yeah. Um, it’s uh, the—the visual language of the three like Zoldycks that we see—the three head Zoldycks that we see is very bizarre. I don’t know—I genu—I don’t know—like is it just to show that—like how serious they are about—like I don’t know why they look the same, but they do. Their faces don’t look the same, they don’t like look like family in that kind of way. But they’re just like—it’s the hair, it’s really the hair and the eyes. Um—
Sylvia: Yeah. There are like resemblances between some characters in the family, but it’s mostly that like—[cross] Kalluto and Killua— 
Keith: [cross] All the black-haired ones have the same face. Oh, okay, Kalluto—yeah. 
Sylvia: Well I was gonna say Kalluto and Killua look pretty similar, um. 
Keith: Yeah. 
[pause] 
Keith: Um, yeah, Kalluto looks like what if Killua wore more um, mascara. 
Sylvia: What if?
Keith: What if?
Dre: Hey, what if? Society if. 
Keith: Um, I mean Killua’s so excited. It’s great for everyone. Do we have anything else about this—this very long, fun, but mostly difficult to comment on butler scene. 
Sylvia: Uh, two things. I thought it was really, really good when they do the—the like hand, sleight of hand, whooshy hands thing and the hands are steaming afterwards. 
Keith: Oh yeah. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Sylvia: Um, really good visual gag I think. Um, also I liked the flow of Leorio gets knocked out, and then Kurapika gets knocked out, and then it’s just Gon. [cross] I thought that was really good. 
Keith: [cross] They have a—they formulate wordless strategy which is like, “Let’s just make sure to guess—to not make the same guesses [Sylvia: Yeah.] so that we don’t [Dre: Mm-hmm.] get knocked out together. 
Sylvia: Yeah, which I think is—is—was a really good little bit of them being a team. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Sylvia: And did we mention that the last one Gon gets is when they do the multi-butler maneuver—
Keith: They do the—
Sylvia: And then it’s like, “It’s actually in the hand of the guy behind me.”
Keith: Yeah, very funny. [Dre: Mm-hmm.] I feel like also a gag. Like that’s so silly, what a goofy way to play that. Like, okay, like I buy that Gon knows that there’s someone behind him. I don’t know what he saw that was like, “The guy behind me has it.” Um, yeah, that was very funny. 
Sylvia: I think—oh, oh—
Keith: And then they break up!
Sylvia: Wait, wait, Killua’s got a new outfit. Killua’s got a—
Keith: Oh yeah. 
Dre: Yeahhhh! 
Keith: Killua’s dressed like streetwear Spawn. 
Sylvia: [laughs]
Jack: He is. Yeah. It’s a sort of—it is—it’s a weird sort of spider web-type outfit-type thing. Um…
Sylvia: Well so the backpack just has a bunch of [cross] straps, basically. And it looked like—it has like six straps total. 
Jack: [cross] Which is cool. This is the third—Killua had a new outfit earlier in the episode when we—oh?
Keith: Sorry, you cut out. It’s cool…?
Jack: Oh, it’s—it’s a kinda cool spider web thing. Killua had a new outfit earlier in the episode when we saw him as an eight-year-old. He was wearing a kind of teal sweater. This is notable because the main characters haven’t really had costume changes up until this point. He looks fuckin’ sick as hell. He’s ready to go. He’s got his little skateboard. And he just…goes. They just let him go. They all leave. 
Keith: Yeah, they all leave. 
Jack: Um…
Keith: He’s like, “We gotta get outta here or my mom’s gonna give us an earful.” 
Keith and Ali: [laugh] 
Keith: It is—it’s so funny how like—like—how lightly he takes—like he treats his family like a normal kid treats a normal family, [Ali: Mm. Mm-hmm.] in this like weird way. Like, he’s—
Jack: [cross] And is occasionally—
Keith: —having spats with his brother, he’s arguing with his mom, he loves his dad because he like, respects him. But like, they’re torture monsters and murderers. 
Jack: And he will occasionally get a little—like a little fragmented moment of, “Oh wait a second, maybe I’m actually extremely damaged, and maybe there is a world outside of this.” But for the most part, yes, he’s like, “This is just my normal family.” But off they go! They get on a little train. Uh, Killua learns to his horror that they used tourist visas to enter the country, when they could’ve used their Hunter Licenses. Uh, and we get confirmed that Gon will not use his Hunter License until he punches Hisoka in the face and returns his badge to him. 
Keith: Hey, if ever a guy should get punched in the face…
Jack: It’s Hisoka Morow! Um, and Kurapika out of nowhere says, “Hey, I know where Hisoka is.” Uh, because it becomes clear that—we are told what Hisoka whispered to him during the fight. If you recall, Hisoka whispered something to Kurapika and then immediately surrendered. And it turns out that what he whispered is, “I’ll tell you something interesting about spiders.” Classic Hisoka [Dre: Mm-hmm.] freak whisper. Uh, you know, we learn that the Phantom Troupe is regularly called the Spiders by people who are familiar with them, ‘cause it’s their logo. So Kurapika was like, “Yeah, I’d love that information.” And uh, Hisoka said, “Okay. Meet me in a perfectly normally named city on September the first in about six months’ time. And I will give you—”
Keith: What is the name of that city, or do we all wanna say it at the same time?
Jack: [laughs] I’ll say it. The city’s name is Yorknew City. [Ali snorts] Y-O-R-K-N-E-W space City. Yorknew Cityyyyy. 
Keith: Strangely familiar.
Ali: Hmmmm. 
Jack: Well, on September the first, what could be happening on September the first in Yorknew— [snaps] I know! The famous auction! 
Ali and Jack: [laugh] 
Ali: Uh-huh. Yeah. 
Jack: The world’s largest auction! From September first to tenth! Rare items from all around the world [Ali snorts] will be sold! Tricksters will show up, including the Phantom Troupe, and definitely Hisoka! So, everybody’s like, well we’re gonna meet up in six months’ time in Yorknew City, where they’re gonna have a big auction. [Dre: Mm-hm.] [Ali: Yeah.] The auction arc approaches. 
Keith: Everyone loves an auction—oh, this is another trope of the genre, the auction arc. 
Jack: I don’t—I think you’re pulling my leg. 
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: Yeah. [laughs]
Dre: Yeah, I think you’re making that up, Keith. 
Keith: Sorry, I was lying. 
Ali: Woooow. On the Internet?
Keith: Yeah. I was lying on the Internet. 
Sylvia: [with mock outrage] What?!
Keith: Sorry. 
Ali: [sighs heavily]
Jack: Yeah, on the Internet?
Sylvia: But I thought the computer was smart. 
Keith and Jack: [laugh] 
Jack: The, uh—so then everybody says, “Look, all right, well, bye!” Uh, Kurapika’s like, “I gotta get a lot of money if I want to, I guess go to the auction?” I don’t know what this is about, Kurapika. You don’t need to bid on anything.
Keith: No, Kurapika doesn’t want—Kurapika doesn’t want a—uh, money to bid, Kurapika wants a patron to hire him uh, to like, do a job. 
Jack: I thought to get money. 
Keith: To get—so he—
Sylvia: There’s a like, implication that it like, costs a certain amount to get into the auction, I think. 
Dre: Yeah.
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: And uh, then Leorio’s like, “Yeah, I’m gonna go study to be a doctor like the plan always was.” 
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: And so after all this, now it’s just Gon and Killua. 
Ali: Wow. 
Keith: And what do they do with their time? Six months, probably have some fun in six months. Probably do some hangin’ out?
Jack: [emphatically] No. We have to train. Leading to an extremely funny sight gag. Uh, ‘cause we get a little Killua PowerPoint presentation. 
Sylvia: Oh my god. Oh my god. 
Ali: [snorts]
Jack: Killua gets a stick, he draws a little distance, a little span in the ground. 
Keith: Oh yeah, he’s doing it, he’s pulling a Kurapika. 
Jack: And he says, “This is the power difference between Hisoka and Hanzo.” And Gon says, “And what about the power difference between Hisoka and me?” [Dre laughs] And Killua— [wheezes] it’s so good. It’s like a single shot, they don’t cut here. Killua picks up the stick and walks really far back in the frame. Really, really far back drawing a line, and says, “Oh probably—probably over here.” And then Gon says, “And what about you?” [Sylvia laughs] And Killua walks a fair distance back towards Gon and draws a line in the ground, and turns around and says, “Wow, I’m so humble!” to himself. 
Ali: [continuous laughter]
Keith: And he’s got a little cat face on!
Dre: And he’s got his little cat face!
Sylvia: There’s—
Jack: It is really funny. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Sylvia: It’s so good. Killua’s so good. There’s um—Ali can talk to me about this, ‘cause she also read this in the manga. One of my favorite manga panels is in this bit where Gon asks Killua like, how he—how he knew power levels between everyone. And Gon says, “How do you do it?” And Killua goes, “Draw on the floor? Nothin’ to it!” while blushing. [Ali laughs] And it’s just really good. 
Jack: [laughs]
Keith: Oh, that’s what—there’s a different blushing moment in this one, which is uh, when—when uh, Killua draws himself on the ground and is like, “I’m so humble” and then Gon’s like, “Wow, Killua, you’re amazing!” And he’s like, “Aw, shucks.” 
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvia: It’s great. It’s—it’s fantastic. 
Ali: Yeahhhh. 
Keith: Uh, the—well Leorio’s gone, so they need a new character who blushes all the time. 
Dre: Mm. 
Jack: Yeah. That’s true. 
Keith: The—the funny thing is they don’t actually ever show you where Killua puts himself. You don’t ever get it—
Jack: No, but not as close as you might think. 
Keith: Can I ask you, Jack, how accurate you think this graph is? How right do you think Killua was? 
Jack: [blows into the microphone] About what? About—about—
Keith: The placements of all four characters
Jack: Oh, of all four characters?
Keith: Yeah. 
Jack: Uh, so he—he says that—Killua’s implication is that Hisoka is the most powerful person they’ve faced. [Keith: Yeah.] Well, on this list. [Keith: Right.] Uh, I would put—I think Killua is stronger than Hanzo. I was surprised to see Killua rate himself less powerfully than Hanzo. Um, I might swap Hanzo and Killua and I might bring Gon way closer to the pack. I think Killua is still feeling a little sour about being rated—about being seeded lower than Gon in the branch. The branch? The bracket. 
Sylvia: [laughs] Listen to Friends at the Table if you wanna know about the Branch. 
Ali: [snorts]
Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, yeah, he, you know, he’s like, “I’m more powerful than Gon so I really need to rub it in. [Keith laughs] You know, I need to go all the way out there into the distance.” So that’s my answer, bring Gon closer to the pack, swap Hanzo and Hisoka so that the power rating, and the—the—all of them, least to most goes, Gon, Hanzo, Killua, Hisoka. 
Keith: And what do you think—what about the difference between—so, so Hanzo and Hisoka were pretty close on the graph. Do you—are you keeping that?
Jack: I’d move them a bit further apart. I—the problem is I think Hisoka can kill anybody. [laughs]
Ali: Hm.
Dre: Yeah. Fair. 
Jack: —without problem. And so—
Keith: But you’ve also said that about Killua. 
Jack: And so can Killua. 
Keith: Yeah. [laughs]
Jack: And so can Killua. Um, yeah, yeah. Who’s the most powerful character we’ve met so far? It’s Killua. 
Keith: You think so? And that includes Hisoka. 
Jack: Yeah, I think—I don’t think—I don’t think Hisoka would give Killua a problem, really. [Keith: Okay.] I think Killua would just go, “I don’t know why we’re doing this fight. This is boring to me. I don’t wanna fight the clown.” 
Keith: Interesting. 
Ali: [distant wheeze-laugh]
Jack: He pulled that serial killer’s heart out in one second. 
Keith: Sure, but it doesn’t take a lot—regular humans in our world that couldn’t pass the Hunter Exam for shit can kill fifty people. If they really wanted to. 
Sylvia: Damn. 
Jack: Woah. Don’t, though. 
Ali: Wow. 
Keith: Don’t. 
Jack: Don’t. 
Sylvia: Hey, if you’re listening to this, don’t. 
Keith: If you’re listening to this, don’t. 
Sylvia: Don’t kill fifty people. 
Keith: And don’t want to either. 
Jack: [cross] Friends at the Table is very anti-murder. 
Sylvia: [cross] We can’t control that. We can’t control if they want to. 
Keith: No. 
Jack: That’s true. 
Sylvia: I think they should be allowed to want to, just don’t do it. 
Keith: But I—I’m gonna be honest, we can’t control if they’re gonna anyway, so it might as well—if we’re already not controlling things you might as well still say, “Don’t want to kill people.” 
Jack: Look, look, we’re getting into the weeds here. I think the important bit is that everybody now getting ready to go off to make some money and get themselves into a good position to attend the auction of the year. 
Keith: But wait, how could you make money and train at the same time?
Jack: [gasps] Well you should go to…the Heavens Arena. And then the narrator says, [in a deeper voice] “Gon and Killua have figured out a way to make money and train.” 
Ali: [snorts and laughs]
Keith: [laughs]
Jack: “At the Heavens Arena.” Cut to credits. That really was like a little mini-arc [Sylvia: Yeah.] when you described it earlier. 
Final thoughts [2:11:56]
Keith: Yeah. Yeah. Uh, any final thoughts on these? Any uh, any manga differences, Ali, in these that you wanna—that we didn’t get to? Um, other final thoughts?
Ali: Um, yeah, nothing crazy. I feel like this was a little, y’know, it was a little by the numbers like the—the plot kind of paced out the same way. You get some more details, you spend some more time with people [Keith: Okay.] in the anime than you do in the manga. But, it seemed, you know—pretty—pretty, uh. A pretty, you know, good adaption in that way. Uh, what I have. It’s weird, it’s the thing of like, since I read it the first time, would I have made this two episodes instead of four, or perhaps three. [Jack: Hm.] Um, maybe. [Sylvia: Mm-hm.] Oh, I think a funny thing that um is important in the manga is that I think in this part, or maybe the part right before, there is [laughs] a dress up Gon um funny game that plays out through the couple of chapters. [Jack laughs] Like, in one—in one chapter and illustration it’s like him in a pair of boxer shorts or whatever and the next two, it’s just like clothes that you can cut out and put on him which I thought was really funny. 
Keith: [laughs]
Jack: That’s so cute. 
Ali: Um, and then for 43 there was an announcement that uh, Higurashi married Naoko, uh—I should look up her name, uh the creator of Sailor Moon!
Sylvia: Takeuchi. 
Ali: Um, so. 
Keith: Oh, that’s great. 
Ali: Yeah, they got married between chapters uh, 43 and 44, apparently. 
Keith: That’s so—that’s so early. 
Ali: I know!
Sylvia: The little way that he draws the two of them is so cute. [Ali laughs] She’s a bunny and he’s like a little chibi dog. 
Ali: [continuous laughter] 
Sylvia: It’s really good. 
Jack: That’s great. 
Keith: Uh, also the occasions where he will do a doodle of a Sailor Moon character it’s always really good. 
Ali: Yeahhhh. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Ali: Yeah. Such a power couple. The illustration is really cute ‘cause it’s like, “Here’s me asking her. Here’s us planning the wedding.” And it’s like the both of them just laying on the floor then like, “Here’s the reception, here’s the honeymoon,” and then the final thing is, “Now we work right next to each other.” And it’s two of them at two different desks with like their—their backs facing away from the camera and it’s really—it’s really very very sweet. 
Jack: That’s so sweet. 
Keith: So cute. 
Dre: Mm-hm.
Ali: Um, so. Congratulations for that, years ago at this point. 
Jack: [cross] Yeah. Congratulations. 
Keith: [cross] Yeah, many years ago. Congratulations. 
Ali: Mm-hmm. Um, but yeah, overall my impressions of the manga have been really good. I’ve been really enjoying it. 
Keith: Favorite character? 
Ali: The—um…that is so tough, and I was thinking about this before this because I was like, I should have an answer for this, but I feel like it’s still really too early. I love Gon obviously. Um, Keith, you know I was reading Dragon Ball a bit before this. [Keith: Yes.] Um, and that’s my big like, this era shonen tropes touchstone. [Keith: Yeah.] And the thing that I keep running into when I read Hunter x Hunter is the same sort of thing of like, you have this protagonist who’s just a magnet, and who’s also like shockingly good at stuff, and that’s really all you have to do. Um, and then, just how much he loves drawing Gon. Like you can really see it in the first couple of chapters where he’s like still working out the characters and the story and stuff, and just like how often he’s drawing Gon’s face is just like, there’s a lot of affection there which I really really appreciate going through it. And the final thing I wanted to say is how surprising some of the pacing has been. Um, like I feel like the story spends time setting up like, the puzzle box for the—the next—for the volume or whatever, and then ends up getting through it in a way that feels like, more quick and like refreshing than I thought it would be. I—I obviously wasn’t on the podcast for the—the like Hunter Exam stuff, [Keith: Mm-hm.] but I kind of—I took a break in between reading it from the first trial where Kurapika like knocks that person out and there’s the debate about like, “Are we gonna kill them? Do we know that he’s killed?” Yadda yadda. Um, and I—I was going back expecting to be like, oh and you know, everybody else’s test is gonna have this same like, sort of length because this is like, introduction to these characters. Um, but to have that end up being like, Leorio bets all of his time away and that’s it, and then um, [Keith laughs] Killua just fucking rips that guy’s heart out in one chapter [Dre laughs] and we’re done, I was like, damn, okay, that’s the Hunter arc. 
Jack: No messing about. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Ali: [wheezing] Yeah, just, y’know, we’re in and out on this one. You had the one big tough introduction, and then for the rest of them it was okay, people get it. Um, and I—I appreciated that. 
Keith: It’s something I like about the show that it’s willing to be very unpredictable with how long things are gonna take.
Ali: Yeah. 
Keith: It’s not afraid to slow down and it’s something that I really like in an anime is like, these slow episodes like the first two where they’re mostly just hanging around um, sort of training, sort of, you know, doing some character stuff, um. I really like when an anime will go—any show, really—will go from the ten out of ten excitement of the Hunter Exam and be like, “We need three episodes that are at like a three out of ten before we can gear back up.” And I think it’s a good way to like, not get like um, like, uh, like crisis creep, where like every thing has to be bigger and crazier than the thing that just happened. [Ali: Mm-hmm.] Like, just take a second, reset your stakes, and then jump back in. And Hunter x Hunter’s a show that’s really good at that, and really good at like, getting through something that you think might be—might be too long really fast. But also getting in and being like, oh this could be a chapter, no, this one’s gonna be two chapters. 
Ali: [laughs]
Dre: [laughs]
Ali: Yeah, and I—I do really appreciate that about, especially this set of episodes, because of your description of it being like a little mini-arc is like, you introduce a bunch of characters, you introduce a bunch of ideas, you really get a sense of who Killua is and where he comes from, and like, y’know, in the chapters before it’s like, “Who’s this mysterious boy? And he’s an assassin and he’s cooler and he—” Y’know. You have this understanding where Gon got his skills from, but like where—where is he coming from and like, how violent is he really? Um, and to have this place to sort of measure him against the other members of his family, and you’re not just measuring him against like, the other protagonists is really refreshing. And then you also have this like, mini emotional arc for Gon where it’s like, “Oh I’m really frustrated, and y’know, I—I haven’t—I have this goal set in front of me. I have these frustrations that are still with me from how the Hunter Exam went, but like I’m dedicated to this other thing.” And at the end of this arc, we’re gonna have this sort of like, return to the status quo where you know the gang is back together and then, even though they’re separated you sort of know where their—their paths are pointing them. Um, that like—
Keith: September first in Yorknew City!
Ali: Right, yeah, I think it would be a weaker story if it was, oh Killua’s here now—I’m—I keep trying to pronounce him like the—the liquor and it’s really weird. [laughs] [Keith and Sylvia laugh] He’s here and, y’know, now we’re gonna do another, y’know, tournament arc, or we’re gonna do another like, “We’re all gonna go hunting together.” Be sort of forced to be in a situation um, I think like doing it this way where it’s like, okay we—we’ve set out what we said what we would do in terms of supporting each other and now we have like, our own priorities. Has—this feels very smart from like a storytelling perspective [Keith: Mm.] and feels like more honest to—to who these guys are. [Keith: Mm-hm.] So, I’m—I’m looking forward to seeing where it goes. [Jack: Yeah.] Um, I think that—the only other thing that I wanted to say in this first episode, besides thank you for—for having me and shoutouts to Media Club Plus. 
Keith: Yeah, of course. 
Jack: Of course! 
Ali: Um, shoutouts to the first season of Hunter x Hunter. Um, the—the moment that I knew that I wanted to read Hunter x Hunter, it was a couple months before it got added to the Shonen Jump app and somebody, a friend of mine, posted a screencap of one of the pages, and I don’t know when this comes up, and Jack you wanna cover your eyes, I’m sorry, but it’s not like, a spoiler. Um, it was a panel of someone, I think Killua, looking at Gon, and being like, “Sometimes when I look at you it’s like looking into the sun, and it’s too bright to focus on.” 
Sylvia: Augh! 
Ali: [laughing] And I was just like I need to know what’s going on here! [dissolves into laughter]
Jack: [laughs] Yeah, that’s a—if ever there was a panel that you see and you go—especially with—with these two part—the way these two particular weirdos look. 
Ali: Uh-huh! [wheezes] Yeah!
Jack: Oh, excellent. 
Ali: Yeah. So, I’m looking forward to seeing where the emotional stakes in this show go because, you know, through osmosis I feel like, that you know, we’re gonna get in it at some point. Um, but to like just see how like, like cute and fresh and like, y’know, it’s not that like the situations aren’t gritty and it isn’t like a fucked up like, “Oh they’re fighting and there’s death and there’s blood and, y’know, they’re facing things.” Like just the way that these characters came together and the way that they interact with each other has still been like, really refreshing in a way? Like it’s not like a comedy but it—it doesn’t lose its heart despite, y’know, the like Squid Game fucking murder house that they were in. 
Keith: [laughs]
Jack: [laughs] Uh-huh. 
Ali: [laughs] 
Keith: It is really able to play both sides of it tonally in a way that like doesn’t—it never feels like it’s like—like muddying itself. Like, you always get the pulled back, I am an observer watching what is literally happening and it’s horrible. [Ali: Mm-hmm.] And zoom in and like, everyone’s happy and laughing. [Ali laughs] And like—it’s like, they’re happy and laughing ‘cause they’re fuckin’ sick. [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: But! It’s still cute. 
Ali: Mm-hmm. 
Jack: Yeah. Good show. 
Keith: Yeah, good show. 
Ali: Good show!
Keith: Uh, any other closing thoughts? 
Jack: Oh, what are we watching next time?
Keith: Uh, next time. That is such a good question that I’m prepared to answer. [Dre laughs] This is the end—this is the end of season one. [Dre: Mm-hmm.] Episode 26 is a flashback episode, um, it’s the same as episode 13 was, so, y’know, watch it if you want a recap of season one, but. Or, really watch it if you want a recap of the last 13 episodes. Uh, but, we’re watching episodes one through three of the Heavens Arena arc, um, you might consider those episodes 27, 28, and 29, depending on how you’re watching things.
Jack: Cool. Cool. [pause] Excellent. I’m very excited. 
Keith: Uh, Ali, do you have any—do you want a closing plug?
Ali: Um, closing plug—listen to Friends at the Table. You might be watching—you might be listening to Media Club Plus because a friend of yours has been talking about Friends at the Table for years and was finally like, “Listen, you can listen to something else, they’re just, you know, watching Hunter x Hunter or whatever.” But like, you should listen to Friends at the Table. Um—
Keith: Yeah, that’s true. 
Ali: Uh-huh. 
Dre: It’s great. 
Keith: Hey, and shoutout to your friend who got you to listen to Media Club Plus because they’re a fan of Friends at the Table. That’s great. 
Ali: Mm-hmm. 
Keith: That’s a good kinda friend. 
Jack: If I want—
Sylvia: That’s a really good friend. If you wanna be a good friend, you should make your friends listen to us. 
Keith: [laughs]
Ali: [laughs]
Jack: If I wanted to get into Friends at the Table, where should I start listening to it? There’s so many episodes. 
Sylvia: Partizan. Or Sangfielle. One of the two. [Ali: Mm-hmm.] We have a lot of seasons, but those are kind of the agreed upon starting points among the show people. 
Jack: Yeah. We got Partizan, a story—a sci-fi story of revolution on a holy moon. And we have got Sangfielle, a story about a blighted desert wasteland inhabited by strange mechanical gods, possessed shapes, werewolves but cooler, uh, what else lives in Sangfielle? All kinds of stuff. 
Keith: Trains. 
Jack: Uh, god of luck. 
Dre: Mm-hmm. 
Jack: Um. Yeah. Shrew people. 
Keith: Bugs. 
Sylvia: Bu—lots of bugs. 
Ali: Ohhh. Yeah. 
Jack: But in a—in a good way. 
Sylvia: Skeletons.
Jack: Skeletons. 
Sylvia: Funny skeletons. 
Keith: Lots—really funny skeletons.
Jack: Maybe some people have built heaven, but not very well. 
Ali: [snorts]
Sylvia: You know, listen to find out! 
Keith: Yeah. 
Jack: Yeah!
Sylvia: There’s a lot of stuff in there. It’s a good time. 
Jack: Yeah, absolutely. 
Keith: Uh, any other closing plugs? Jack? 
Jack: No, I don’t think so, I mean any music that you hear on this show or on Friends at the Table you can get to by going to notquitereal.bandcamp.com. I’m proud of it, I make a lot of music for the shows we make. By this point you will have heard several themes for a anime rewatch podcast, [Dre laughs] because I think that’s funny. Um, and they are available at notquitereal.bandcamp.com. 
Keith: Um, uh, Sylvi, any—any closing plugs? 
Sylvia: Uhhh. Uhhhhhh. Sylvibullet on everything. Uh, emoboyskissing.bandcamp.com. [Dre: Wooo!] I said that earlier. Uh, what are all—did we the—TikTok, friends_table. Friendsatthetable on Twitch. Um, check out our YouTube. We, uh, there’s—uh, the restreams of Bluff City season 1 are all hosted there if you didn’t catch them live. Uh, what else. What other show stuff am I missing right now? Cohost! Friends-table. 
Keith: Oh, friends-table on Cohost, yeah that’s true. 
Sylvia: Um, I think—I think—I can’t think of anything else. 
Keith: The Cohost gets everything that the Twitter gets, so if you’re off of X.com, [Ali: Mmm.] you can go on—go on the Cohost, that’s a great way to not be on Twitter but still follow Friends at the Table. Um, it actually gets more stuff—it gets like slightly different stuff, it’s like mostly overlapping the same, but, um, it’s not always literally the exact same. Uh, Dre, anything else? 
Dre: No, I think that’s everything. 
Keith: All right, um, you can…I don’t know. Yeah, that’s it. Uh, oh hey, this is—I remember what I was going to say. This is the second episode that we’re recording since we got our album artwork. Did we already talk about the album artwork—or the uh, podcast art? 
Jack: Yeah, the Media Club Plus art is by the wonderful Annie Johnston-Glick, who you can find her website by going to anniejg.com. It is an extremely cool piece of art, as you will be able to see with your eyes right now, if you look down at the device. Um, it is a photograph, it is a real-world model that is slightly larger than you anticipate it being, and almost everything in it is—is actually modeled and placed and uh lit in the scene. The view of Whale Island is like a quilt. It’s an extremely cool piece of art. Um, Annie and I both got very excited looking at the old I Spy books, those sort of great photograph dioramas. We are really stoked about it and we hope you are too! 
Keith: Uh, yeah, you said piece of art, but it’s actually pieces of art. 
Ali: Mm.
Jack: It is?
Keith: Yeah, it’s many pieces of art. 
Ali: [laughs] 
Jack: Oh I suppose it is, yes, many. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Jack: Yes, many distinct pieces of art. 
Keith: Um, yeah, all right, that’s it. Bye everyone, thank you. 
[“The Boy in Green” by Jack de Quidt begins playing] 
Ali: Byeeeee.
Dre: Byeeeee. 
Keith: Thanks to Ali for joining. 
Jack: Goodbye! 
Ali: Thank you for having me! 
Keith: Okay, bye. 
Sylvia: [laughs] 
Keith: Good job. 
Sylvia: We don’t—we don’t clap at the end either. 
Ali: This isn’t fine. Um, what if you lose the backup sometime and then you just have these floating—these free-floating MP3s? 
[song plays out]
