Jack Powell (@likeyouneedtono on twitter, started at 7:50, stopped at 42:40)
Katie Diekhaus @katiediek, started at 42:41 to end of episode) 


KEITH: This should be much easier because there's only three of us.


AUSTIN: And because we're... we know... now all believe in time.is.


KEITH: Yeah, we all understand time.is.


ALI: Oh boy.


KEITH: We understand that time.is.


ALI: Little baby Jack.


JACK: I just didn't know that time.was.


AUSTIN: We want to do this at...


KEITH: 05? Want to do it at 05?


AUSTIN: Let's do it at 05. Yep.


ALI: Oh that's soon.


(Four claps, not synchronized)


KEITH: That was the worst one yet.


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: (laughing) I like that, 2 seconds ago you were like "Oh it'll be easier because there's only four of us".


KEITH: 20. We're going on 20.


ALI: Ok.


KEITH: Ok.


(One clap, followed by three nearly synchronous claps)


ALI: (Laughs)


KEITH: I think we figured it out. The reason why it's not easier is because one of the bad clappers is one of you.


(Laughter by all)


ALI: (still laughing) Fu-u-u-uck you.


KEITH: It's the fucking sour apple is in this group.


JACK: Is there any way we can weed them out? And I say that with the full knowledge that it's me.


ALI: I think you, me, and Jack are actually the worst clappers.


KEITH: I was looking at the little box that shows up around your face when you were talking.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


KEITH: And I think that it's Ali.


(Ali and Jack gasp)


KEITH: Pretty sure.


ALI: Yeah, it's probably me.


AUSTIN: Oh Ali. You can't hesitate, you know?


KEITH: Because, and Jack, here's why I believe that it's not you, and it's because you're a musician.


ALI/AUSTIN: Mh-hmm.


KEITH: And you understand how, you know...  rhythm works.


JACK: What, I understand that when a number pops up I'm supposed to clap?


KEITH: No no no, you just understand that, that... you can more easily recognize the distance between two... beats than maybe Ali can.


JACK: Keith, you're giving me far too much credit. 


ALI: (laughing) This is so rude and mean. 


KEITH: I'm just saying that Ali doesn't even know how to clap.


AUSTIN: Wow.


ALI: I'm offended right now, I'm gonna hang up, I'm quitting.


JACK: And we wonder why Hella is evil.


(All laugh)


KEITH: Wait, hold on a sec...


AUSTIN: This explains everything.


KEITH: Hella's evil?


JACK: Yeah, absolutely.


AUSTIN: Oh boy... Are we ready?


KEITH: Yeah, we're ready.


JACK: (languidly) How we feeling, re: dungeoneering?


AUSTIN: We'll find out.


KEITH: Positively.


JACK: I'm pro dungeons. 


AUSTIN: Alright. (pauses for a moment) How do I normally go into this?


JACK: You say that,...


AUSTIN: I have a thing written but...


JACK: You say that your name's Austin Walker...


AUSTIN: We say hi...


JACK: Then you say what's going on. 


AUSTIN: Ok. (pause) Hey everyone...


KEITH: (interrupting) Sometimes you ...


AUSTIN: Well...


ALI: (shushes Keith)


(Everyone begins to speak over each other, until clock)


AUSTIN: Now it's ruined. Now it's ruined. You ruined it.


KEITH: I, eh, uh, Sorry. 


JACK: We're just giving Keith material, now. 


AUSTIN: All this is gold. This is intro gold.


ALI: Should we re-clap? This, this feels bad.


JACK: Should we do another clap? Ok, here we go. 


(One person claps)


AUSTIN: Yeah, let's...


KEITH: Yeah, we should, ok, here we go. Three, two, one...


(Clock chimes; four claps, more synchronized than previously; opening theme begins)


(Austin laughs)


KEITH: Alright, perfect, couldn't have done better. 


AUSTIN: (still laughing at first) The, the, the clock even clapped. Hey everyone. Hi... Hi internet. I'm Austin Walker. Welcome to Friends at the Table, an actual play podcast focused on critical worldbuilding, smart characterization, and fun interaction between good friends. Presented by streamfriends.tv and runbutton.net. From runbutton.net, joining us is Keith Carberry. Hey Keith.


KEITH: Hi, my name's Keith Carberry, you can find me at twitter @somethingdumb or the let's plays that I do at runbutton.net or youtube.com/runbutton.


AUSTIN: And repping streamfriends, Ali Acampora.


ALI: Um, hi. My name is Alicia Acampora, and you can find me @ali_west on twitter


AUSTIN: And Jack de Quidt.


JACK: Hi there. I'm Jack de Quidt. You can find me on twitch and twitch @notquitereal and at my games studio's website, thetalltreesgames.co.uk


AUSTIN: And I'm Austin Walker. You can find me @austin_walker on twitter, theCalcutec on twitch, also at twitch.tv/streamfriends. And you can read the things I write, often about games, on clockworkworlds.com. Today, we're going to continue our Dungeon World game. Dungeon World is a game by Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel, based on a different game called Apocalypse World by D. Vincent Baker. I always want to like, shout them out, at the beginning of this, cause they do good things. They, they put in work and deserve that recognition. 


(Music fades out)


AUSTIN: Uh, as always, I want to just start off by just repeating, like a mantra, the agenda of Dungeon World. It's to portray a fantastic world, to fill the character's lives with adventure, and to play to find out what happens. Last time, we had way more people on this podcast. Don't worry, if your favorite isn't here, they will be next week. 


KEITH: Yeaaah, but they are. 


Ali: (unintelligible)


AUSTIN: They, right, they are still... Oh, I see what you're saying.


ALI: Hey, what's up.


KEITH: (overlapping Ali) Yeah, yeah yeah yeah. 


JACK: How's it going.


AUSTIN: Wow, waaaow.


(Keith laugh)


AUSTIN: Shots fired.


JACK: (overlapping Austin) Is this the beginning of a beef? This is the beginning of a beef.


KEITH: This is the beginning of a beef. 


AUSTIN: This got real beefy. 


JACK: Hey Hella.


KEITH: Here Nick, have a burger. Where's the beef? In the burger. There it is. 


AUSTIN: Wow


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Uh, so the reason, so, one. From the jump we kinda planned on bringing on a sixth player, plus me would be the gm which would be seven players. Ah, and we always knew that would be just, not possible. 


KEITH: Mh-hmm.


AUSTIN: So what we did was we split the group into two smaller groups, and the formation of those groups might not be permanent. Like, this might this might just be for the next, for this one adventure, then we'll switch it up again, or who knows. We'll see how it goes. But if you're like, dying to hear from Art's Hadrian character, or from the Great Fantasmo, Nick's wonderful elf wizard, they will be in next week's episode, along with Andrew Lee Swan's new elven ranger, Throndir. "Thron-deer", I think his name is, or "Thron-der". I don't know how to pronounce elven, elvish. Um...


JACK: Well you just made some big elvish faux-pas there. 


AUSTIN: I, I mean... You're always gonna, you know? (Jack laughs) You're always gonna, with the elves. That's just how it is. But today, we're gonna focus on Hella, Lem, and Fero, who are off doing their, their own thing. Like the first adventure, um, I'm gonna start off by sending around some, some love letters. Are you guys ready for love letters?


KEITH: (enthusiastically) Yeah.


JACK: I'm gonna be really disappointed if this...


KEITH: (overlapping Jack) I didn't realize that we kept getting these.


JACK: I'm gonna... (chuckles) I'm gonna be really disappointed if this isn't an actual love letter. 


AUSTIN: Well. Uh, I, um...


KEITH: Yeah, I would like mine to be steamy, please. 


AUSTIN: I will say this Jack, the one I'm about to send you, for Lem, does ask where he spends the night.


JACK: (laughs) I, don't know, I don't know if that counts Austin. Seems a little tokenistic, eh?


AUSTIN: Wink.


JACK: Um...


ALI: Steamy...


AUSTIN: (overlapping Ali) You go ahead, go ahead, it is steamy. Let's start with, let's start with Jack. 


JACK: Oh dear. Oh dear. (Laughs). (Begins to recite) Lem, the Archivists were waiting by the docks when you returned, but you slipped away off the side of the ship. They were waiting for you after your debriefing with the Council, but you lost them in the labyrinthine Garden District. It would be evening soon. How will you secure safety during the night? If you use your charm and wiles, spend 4d6 minus Charisma... oh, 4d6 plus Charisma? That looks like minus.


AUSTIN: No, it's actually, it should be minus, in fact, I actually just typed that wrong. It should be minus your whole Charisma score.


JACK: Minus my entire Charisma score?


AUSTIN: It should be minus Charisma, not minus CHA. Not minus CHA, minus Charisma. 


JACK: For listeners to the podcast, Austin just typed the single word "Charisma" to me in skype. 


AUSTIN: Yep. (Keith laughs)


JACK: (Resuming reading) If you use your charm and wiles, spend 4d6 minus Charisma on safe lodgings at a trustworthy inn. If furtively find a hidden alley, rooftop, or corner to spend the night in, spend one ration. Where did you stay? The next day, you're very sleepy. Take -1 forward.


JACK: (No longer reading) Well I think I'm gonna have to use my charm and wiles here. 


AUSTIN: That's fair. That's fair. So... let's go over to this new system we have set up. People at home who can't see this, we finally set an account at roll20.net, and we're gonna give that a shot, and see how that plays out. 


JACK: So, what's absolutely definitely going to happen now, is I'm going to type the command wrong and everyone's gonna have a bit of a laugh.


AUSTIN: Yep.


JACK: So, I go.


KEITH: I, are, Austin, are we recording the roll20 footage?


AUSTIN: (overlapping Keith) I am.


KEITH: Just so that... ok. 


AUSTIN: Just in case. I, I haven't decided yet if I’m gonna post it. 


JACK: So people aren't just going to hear about my comedy mistake?


--7:50


(overlapping)
AUSTIN: I mean, they might.
KEITH: They might actually see it.


JACK: Ok, so my charisma is 16, so I’m going to roll 4d6 minus 16. And the solution is... minus one. (JACK laughs)


AUSTIN: Woah! Look at that, (KEITH: Yeah.) that means that you did very well for yourself.


KEITH: Nice.


AUSTIN: Where, where- so you’re in a-


JACK: Wait, why did I want a low number?


AUSTIN: You wanted a low number because this is how much gold it would cost you, how much coin it would cost you to spend on lodgings. 


(overlapping)
KEITH: Yeah it cost you one coin. 
JACK: Oh...


AUSTIN: No, it cost you no coins, in fact.
JACK: Oh, I see.


AUSTIN: It cost him negative one coin! I’m not gonna give you an extra coin, though maybe I should. Maybe, yeah! Actually, wait! Yeah, you get a coin, you’re a bard! Right?


(Laughing)


(overlapping)
KEITH: He fucking, he shows up, they know who he is, they’re like “Oh man this guy!”
JACK: I don’t think I so much…


KEITH: “Take this coin stay here, please!”


JACK: I don’t know if they know that it is, that they know who I am because I’m on the run right now… So, that’s possibly not a good idea.


AUSTIN: Right, but maybe you’re able to maybe do a couple songs that night. Maybe in exchange for lodgings their like-


KEITH (overlapping AUSTIN) Oh right he’s a bard. 


AUSTIN: “Listen, you can stay here tonight if you play a couple tunes for us, and we’ll let you take home the tips.” And the tips are terrible. The tips are one coin, all night. But, hey it’s free lodgings. 


KEITH: Hold on, maybe it was a bunch of coins that all equaled like one of the big coins. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, right, sure, sure. That’s fair.


JACK: So, I’ve got, I add one coin to my store of coins?


AUSTIN: Yeah! Go ahead and add one coin to your store of coins.


JACK: Oh, thank you.


AUSTIN: Coin in this game is, is, I wanted to address this in the game really quick too. Coin is just like the term for whatever your currency is, and one of the things that we talked about the end of last session was that you got a bunch of gold and there had been some debate about whether or not that should be more valuable, or like, y’know, how do we transfer from that into the kind of like, the kind of money of the region? Which is like, what did you say it was, like little bone circles? Like little fish bone circles. 


JACK: (affirming noise)


AUSTIN: Which is kind of a bronze era style currency. And one of the things that I thought of earlier today was that the gold coin, it could just be that the gold coin is universal, right? That like, this town, and maybe, this town which is now called Velas, instead of the Burg, we figured out a name for this town in the interim. And the island where Ali is from, Ordenna, both of those take the kind of scrimshaw bone coin. But, everywhere in the world takes gold. 


JACK: Yes.


AUSTIN: I don’t know, do you think that that’s?


KEITH: Are people like a little more, are people, even though it is isn’t worth more, are people more impressed with it?


AUSTIN: Yeah! Because, I mean, it suggests that you’re a traveller, right? It suggests-


KEITH: Right.


AUSTIN: It’s like having, it’s like having an American Express? Do you know what I mean? Like, twenty years ago where it was like “Oh!”. (Laughing in the background) Yeah, but it’s still just, it’s still just a credit card, but “Oh!”. 


KEITH: So it’s like having a Discover, now?


AUSTIN: (Laughs) Is that what it’s like?


KEITH: (exaggerating) No, it’s not. 


AUSTIN: Okay, so-


JACK: I don’t know Keith’s talking about, so…


KEITH: I, yeah.


AUSTIN: (overlapping) These are different credit cards, this is, don’t, it’s, don’t worry about it.


JACK: Americans…


KEITH: It’s a credit card, that a lot of places don’t accept, because it’s not worth it, to them. To accept it. 


AUSTIN: Right. ‘Cause no one has them. It’s a weird circular probLem. So that’s, that’s, that’s Lem. For, for the sake of ease I’m gonna say that you wound up, the kind of tavern that you stayed in, was in the Fish district? Velas is split into three districts, plus like the outskirts of Velas. There’s a Garden district where the council is, in fact let me, I’ll swing you guys over. Check this out on roll20. Bop! Now you’re on the map. 


JACK: Oh cool.


AUSTIN: So, there’s the council district which is the Garden district, which is where the council is, there’s lots of like super high class homes. Insofar as anyone is rich still, they live in the Garden district. There’s the Fish district, which is the district where the docks are. And that’s where like, the majority of the town lives. That’s like, that’s the population concentration, right? This area used to be, kind of, all merchants, all like, before the fall, before the Erasure, this was, big (?), or business was booming. And now, a lot of that stuff is like, converted homes, but the docks are still, are still there. And then there’s the Sun district which was recently renamed, that from just like “that shitty place where no one wants to go to”, which is just filled with just tons and tons and tons of just, empty homes, empty buildings. You know, you might find a family that lives in a building that once homed, you know, housed twelve families. So there are still people living there, but it’s overgrown and it’s empty. But, in the middle of it, is, the Church of Samothes, you know, Hadrian’s church. And there is some, recent revival of that area, and renovation. So, we’re gonna say you’re in the Fish district and I’m just, I’m saying that now ‘cause it’s important for where we’re gonna go after these love letters. 


JACK: Also, can we-


AUSTIN: Go ahead.


JACK: Can we call it a pub? Tavern for me has like, associations with like, “I say, fine traveller! Here in my Dungeons and Dragons campaign, we met you in a tavern!” 


(ALI laughs)


AUSTIN: Sure. That’s fine, we can call it a pub, or a bar.


JACK: Yeah, exactly.


KEITH: Wait, can it just be a YMCA?


(laughing)


AUSTIN: No, definitely, it’s not a YMCA. Fero, Fero I sent you your love letter. 


KEITH: (reading) Fero, adventure is grand, but it is distracting. On your way back from the island, for about an hour, you lose the true name of your favorite animal from your mountainous home. Thankfully, you find it again before you reach land. Which animal was it, and why is it your favorite? (no longer reading) My favorite animal, to transform into, I say, is, I’m gonna say probably a mountain lion. A cougar. A coug. 


AUSTIN: Why is that your, the coug, why is the- I don’t like that we’re calling it the coug. I’m gonna go on record.


(KEITH laughs)


JACK: This is your tavern moment, Austin.


(AUSTIN laughs)


KEITH: Yeah if I feel like mountain lion is too Dungeons and Dragons-y. So I go with “the coug”. The cougar is, is, probably one of my two favorites but I feel like it’s like the, when I feel like I want to turn into a strong animal-


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


KEITH: I go like “yeah, cougar!” And I feel, I feel like Fero, after the experience at the tower, maybe, kind of, feels less identifying with that sort of like quick jump-to-action sort of, “I’m gonna be a cougar and wreck shit!”, sort of side of him. So, I feel like, part of that, almost remorse, is forgetting the cougar. 


AUSTIN: Great. And last, but certainly not least is Hella. Ali, I sent you yours, also. 


ALI: Yeah. (reading) Hella, you spent less than a day back at your home island of Ordenna before you knew you had to leave. It was the voice of your blade that told you to go, and you listened. What did the voice sound like, did anyone else hear it? (No longer reading) I would say that the voice, isn’t just one voice? 


AUSTIN: (affirming noise)


ALI: It’s like a group of people, but (inhales)


AUSTIN: To be clear, to the listeners and to Jack and Keith. When everyone leveled up, one of the moves that Hella took was one that kind of let her sword come to life, and gain a personality. What’s the actual, I’m gonna find the actual write up of it.


ALI: Yeah, the move is called Heirloom?


AUSTIN: (reading) When you consult the spirits that reside within your signature weapon, they will give you insight regarding the current situation, and might ask you some questions in return. Roll plus charisma, on a plus ten the GM will give you good detail, on a seven to nine the GM will give you an impression. (no longer reading) So, now, her sword is alive, and so yeah, so what are the voices like? 


ALI: So yeah, it’s a group of people, probably… Like, more than three, less than five—


AUSTIN: Okay, so four? 


ALI: —But, you can’t, wait. No, I meant ten.


(KEITH and ALI laugh)


AUSTIN: So, four voices—


KEITH: Some, some random number between three and five! 


(laughing)


AUSTIN: Well, I guess if we don’t say whole numbers, maybe it’s like four point two. Four point two voices. 


ALI: Yeah.


KEITH: So you have, (laughing while speaking) y-you have four and a fifth person (AUSTIN makes “mhm” sound) inside your sword?


ALI: Yeah, one guy is just a backup guy. 


(laughing)


(overlapping)
JACK: He joins in on every fifth word, yeah.
AUSTIN: He’s an understudy.


KEITH: Yeah. Coincidentally, also the boy from Two and a Half Men!


AUSTIN: I’m glad he’s finding work! I hear he’s a jerk, actually, I hear he’s kind of an ass. So, so questions about it. Is it like a chorus of voices that speak together or do they speak individually? 


ALI: They speak together. 


AUSTIN: Oh, okay. So it’s like, almost again like a chorus.


ALI: Yeah.
AUSTIN: Like a kind of a echoey, haunting. Yeah okay. Did anybody else hear you? Hear it, go off and talk to you while you were in...


ALI: No.


AUSTIN: Ordenna. Ordenna (pronounced: Or-day-na) or Ordenna (Or-deh-na)? 


ALI: Ordenna (Or-deh-na), Ordenna (Or-day-na)?


AUSTIN: It’s up to you. (KEITH overlaps) It’s your island. 


KEITH: (overlapping) Ordenna (Or-deh-na). 


AUSTIN: I think I like Ordenna (Or-deh-na). 


ALI: We both said “deh-na” right?


AUSTIN: Yeah, we did, but just now you said “day-na”, (ALI: Okay) so I was confused if I said it wrong before. So did anybody else on Ordenna—


ALI: No.


AUSTIN: Overhear it? No, okay. So you snuck out before that could happen then, that’s good. This is now happening the next night. So, it’s only been like, a very short amount of time since the island. So there was the island, you guys came back, you had your big debriefing with the counsel. They gave you your money from the big chunk that you brought back which was fifty coin. Fifty gold coin that can be spent anywhere. And kind of were just like, “yeah good job”, like, “hang around we might have more for you to do”, y’know, “or don’t, we don’t, like, we’ll get our stuff done”, like you’re not essential at this point. They certainly treat Hadrian, and The Great Fantasmo, both, as more essential. Because of their political ties and standing. And, kind of personal strength, right, like, none of you are wizards, they would like to have a wizard in on this junk. 


KEITH: I can turn into giant animals!


AUSTIN: Yeah, that’s not.


(overlapping)
AUSTIN: That’s not the same.
ALI: Yeah, that’s super rude.


JACK: I know about the history of, of wizards, I think. Yeah, hm. 


(overlapping)
JACK: Anybody? Oh, okay.
ALI: I’m way stronger than everyone else. 


AUSTIN: That’s probably true, but you don’t have a church backing you up, so… 


JACK: That counts for a lot. 


(ALI laughs)


AUSTIN: Through the sort of beautiful coincidences that run life, the three of you find each other the next night. At this point or- At this point, Hella has already gone and returned from Ordenna. Jack has, or Lem has been dodging the archivists who are after him for stealing that violin.


KEITH: Oh, do they know about that now?


AUSTIN: They’ve been knowing about that. They knew about that because of his love letter last ti-, the beginning of the last adventure he (KEITH overlaps) got a partial success and they learned about that. But, he’s been ducking them, successfully. 


KEITH: (overlapping) Oh, right.


AUSTIN: And, finally, y’know, Fero I think he’s just kind of been milling about, thinking about nature and your place in it. 


KEITH: Mhm.


AUSTIN: You find, you find each other in the tavern, in the pub, sorry. (JACK laughs) That Lem hid out in. And you’ve spent the last couple of hours, let’s say, chatting with an elven man named Gregalos. He reminds you of Fantasmo, but a lot nicer, like he’s knowledgeable like Fantasmo is but like, instead of correcting you he- Like instead of correcting you and taking joy in correcting you, he corrects you because he wants you to like, know. Like “Oh, actually, like I read about this, it’s a little different, y’know, blah blah blah.”


KEITH: He’s an elven what, you said?


AUSTIN: He’s just an elf, I mean, he’s an elven man. Is what I said. 


KEITH: Oh, okay.


AUSTIN: Younger than Fantasmo, y’know, not as age- You remember the elves age much more quickly in our world. Our world, by the way, also has a name now or at least this continent does. And that’s Hieron. I don’t know if we decided how we want to say this yet but: Hieron. 
KEITH: Yep, nope, we decided and it’s that. (laughing) That’s what we decided. 


AUSTIN: Okay, so, in Hieron right now-


KEITH: Do I get to bleep that? 


(overlapping)
AUSTIN: Do you get to bleep this?
KEITH: Do I get to bleep everytime you- 


(KEITH laughs)


JACK: Did you just make a rude gesture at the microphone?


AUSTIN: I, no I just pointed.


KEITH: Ey, bleep this!


AUSTIN: Ey! Oh! So, so you spent some time talking to Gregalos and a lot of it is him recounting his adventures out in the world, and he’s just like a really warm guy. Again, knowledgeable, warm, and kind of takes you in, quickly. Do you guys, do you drink? Do your characters drink in this pub?


JACK: Yeah I, I mean I would. 


ALI: Yeah.


KEITH: No, I don’t need to eat or drink.


(JACK laughs)


AUSTIN: Okay.


ALI: You don’t just do it, to like enjoy flavors?


KEITH: No, I kind of sit down near like a, some plant that’s potted in the corner.


AUSTIN: Okay. He’s very nice, Keith, you do want to be around this dude. Like he’s a natural—


KEITH: Oh, also, if I’m in the corner I’m also not near this guy, okay, I’ll go hang out with the guy. 


AUSTIN: I mean, yeah, they’re sitting at a table. Like together.


KEITH: Instead of, I’ll say, instead of eating I’ll inhale the plant and then-


AUSTIN: That’s not, okay, great.


ALI: You should just grab the (KEITH overlaps) plant from the corner and-


KEITH: I’ll just, I, I just hang out with everybody. Is what I do.


ALI: Put it in the chair next to you.


AUSTIN: At some point, he asks you three to talk about your latest adventure, y’know, you’ve already probably gestured towards it a couple of times, that you’ve been out together. And recently returned and he kind of says,


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): So tell me, what, what was this last, you said, you went out with the, with the Captain Sal-, Sal-, mm. 


AUSTIN: He’s like, struggling to get the names right ‘cause he hasn’t really been paying attention. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): Calhoun! You went out with Captain Calhoun to a tower? What, what happened?


JACK (as Lem): It was pretty, it was pretty messed up. 


KEITH (as Fero): It was kind of messed up.


ALI (as Hella): Yeah, it wasn’t good. 


JACK (as Lem): It was not what we expected it to be. We went up there, expecting a pretty standard sort of job, and at every turn things went really, really weird and we kind of all left with a pretty sour taste in our mouths, I think. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): Did you find anything interesting?


ALI (as Hella): Nope. 


KEITH (as Fero): Nope. Well-


(overlapping)
KEITH (as Fero): There was this one thing.
AUSTIN: He gives you a look. 


AUSTIN: He gives you a look when you say “Nope!” 


JACK (as Lem): We got a, we got a book, but we probably, maybe, shouldn’t have? And one of our number, departed with it. And he’s not with us anymore. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): What sort of book?


KEITH (as Fero): A book that made books dance.


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): I’ve heard, I- 


AUSTIN: And he like, looks around at his stuff and like starts digging through things and then rolls out a map in front of you all. Jack, you recognize most of the map because you, you have a big chunk of it already, the kind of northwestern corner of the map of Hieron. But, he points like rapidly to this mark on the map, this kind of like this, almost like a, it’s debatable what it is. It could almost be like a ship, it could be a dagger stabbed into the land, it could be a cross. And he’s like,


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): Is this where you were?


AUSTIN: And, it is, it is where you were. I’ve now moved you over to that map on, on roll20, you should see it. He’s pointing at, at the island north of Ordenna. 


JACK: I mean, should we tell him the truth? He seems like-


KEITH: I’m, I’ll tell him the truth. 


KEITH (as Fero): Yeah, that’s where we were, we were over there. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): Oh, I, this is, I thought these were-


AUSTIN: He seems like he’s trying to decide how much to bring you in on, at this point. 


        AUSTIN (as Gregalos): I, hm.


        (overlapping)
AUSTIN (as Gregalos): I have to make-


KEITH: Just tell him that we’re cool don’t worry about it. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): I have to make plans. This is- Do any of you know the way to Rosemerrow? 


AUSTIN: He says.


KEITH: (as Fero) Oh, yeah! I do!


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): There’s- There’s something I’m interested in. Another book, down in the woods to the south of Rosemerrow. I, I can’t pay much now but I can cover all of your travel expenses and when you’re back, you’ll all be handsomely rewarded. 


JACK (as Lem): What exactly are you looking here from us? You looking for like, protection, or is there something that-


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): I have to, I have to stay here, there’s lots to be done.


JACK (as Lem): Oh so you’re hiring us.


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): Y-you’re adventurers. I’m an adventurer, it’s strange, I know for me to step into the role of a hire-er instead of hire-y. But, yeah, I have to, I know I have to go east but if you can be back here in the next couple of weeks. Here, at this pub, I’ll stay here, we’ll meet back, hand the book off and, I can explain. 


ALI (as Hella): Why can’t you explain now?


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): Because, I have to know if it's, if it’s really the thing I think it is. 


JACK (as Lem): Okay, so I have a couple of questions. Question number one, you’re going east? 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): Yeah. 


JACK (as Lem): Where’s your destination? I’ve got-


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): I know- 


JACK (as Lem): I’ve got some community to the east. I’m just interested. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): Oh, are you one of the, those Archive boys? 


(ALI and KEITH laugh)


JACK (as Lem): Yeah you, you could say I’m one of the Archive boys gang. 


(ALI laughs)


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): I don’t, that changes things a bit. Maybe I’ll have to find someone else.


AUSTIN: He says.


JACK (as Lem): Oh no no no no-


ALI (as Hella): We can do it.


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): I can’t, this book can’t-


AUSTIN: He puts a hand on your shoulder, Lem. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): The archivists can’t have this. 


JACK (as Lem): (breathy laugh) Ok, so I don’t have any particular love for the archivists. 


(AUSTIN laughs)


ALI: Woah!


JACK (as Lem): But, I’m a little intrigued as to why you don’t want this falling into Orcish hands. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): I have no probLem with the Orcs! The Orc’s and I, we have… But, but, the archivists are, let’s just say, let’s just say that things have been, things have been bad the last few times I’ve gone along with them, looking for interesting things. 


KEITH (as Fero): What sort of stuff?


AUSTIN: What was that?


KEITH (as Fero): What sort of, what sort of stuff? 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): There, do you know, do you know the islands to the north of the Archives, Lem? 


JACK (as Lem): Very little, y’know I spent some time there on holidays as a child but, not in any particular sense. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): They did really well, for a while, they, y’know the archivists taught them how to fish, taught them how to sail, y’know. Taught them the basics, helped them get back on their feet but, last time I went they were being a little more pushy. It used to be, it used to be “oh, we’ll, y’know make sure your people eat for a year if you give us this desk,” but now it’s “we’ll make sure your people are alive to eat for the rest of the year if you give us this desk.” 
KEITH (as Fero): What are they doing with the desks?


AUSTIN: He looks at Lem. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): Good question. 


JACK (as Lem): Fero, it’s, you wouldn’t understand. 


KEITH (as Fero): (laughing) I mean, I hung out at the Archives with you. 


JACK (as Lem): Well then you should know, y’know.


KEITH (as Fero): I know, I know kind of, but, are we talking, I guess what I’m asking is it desks, specifically, or were you just using that as a placeholder for whatever they’re actually looking for?


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): I mean when I went it was desks. So-


KEITH (as Fero): It was desks? 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): It was desks, that time.


KEITH (as Fero): Aw, man. Do you know what it’s- Ok. 


JACK (as Lem): Look, we, the whims of the archivists, and in particular the curator, are never particularly clear to, even to the rest of us. If he was looking for desks, he probably had something in mind. Which isn’t, isn’t to justify his actions I’m just saying if you’re wondering why he wanted desks, I’m sure he, I’m sure he knew why he wanted desks. 


KEITH (as Fero): Ok.


JACK (as Lem): Maybe it was desk season, I don’t know. 


KEITH (as Fero): You’re being weird buddy. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): As long as you promise me the archivist won’t get their hands on this.


KEITH (as Fero): It’s fine, he not going back to the, don’t even worry about it. He’s not gonna.


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): Alright. Well, there’s another, another place, down in the woods south of Rosemerrow. You’ll know it when you see it. 


AUSTIN: He smirks. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): You’ll recognize the design. Deep in its heart there will be another book like that one. Do not read it. Just bring it to me. 


JACK (as Lem): Hella?


KEITH (as Fero): Hold on, what if we did read it?


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): You wouldn’t-


(overlapping)
KEITH (as Fero): I don’t want to read it!
AUSTIN (as Gregalos): You would not be safe. 


AUSTIN: He says. 


KEITH (as Fero): I don’t want to, I don’t want to read it, I’m not-


ALI (as Hella): Would not be safe? 


KEITH (as Fero): I’m not like that, I don’t like any of this stuff.


JACK (as Lem): Dude-


KEITH (as Fero): Can we?


JACK (as Lem): I’ve read books that eat people. It’s, y’know. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): How many people?


AUSTIN: He says, straight-faced. 


JACK (as Lem): Oh, you know like twenty or something.


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): That’s nothing. 


(JACK laughs)


KEITH (as Fero): That’s well, hold on, that’s- Twenty’s kind of a lot? So, you’re saying don’t read the book?


AUSTIN: He’s saying don’t read the book. 


KEITH (as Fero): Ok, we won’t read the book. Should we, should we go get this book?


JACK (as Lem): You got anything, Hella? You got anything…


ALI (as Hella): If you guys are going.


[30 min]


JACK (as Lem): (laughs) You don’t have any questions? 


KEITH (as Fero): I have a question!


JACK (as Lem): You’re not Hella.


(ALI laughs)


KEITH (as Fero): I know, I have a question real quick though, Greg. 


(overlapping)
KEITH (as Fero): What about that other book from that other tower, yeah, yeah?
AUSTIN (as Gregalos): It’s- (makes noises to get Fero’s attention)


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): My family calls me Greg, my friends call my Greggy.


(JACK laughs)


KEITH (as Fero): Okay, Greggy. Listen Greggy, Greggy in that other tower there was also- Should anybody not read that other book, too, or is that book cool to read?


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): Who has the book now?


KEITH (as Fero): Just some, just some guy!


JACK (as Lem): A wizard. 


KEITH (as Fero): Yeah, a wizard guy.


(overlapping)
JACK (as Lem): He’s from the University.
KEITH (as Fero): He really seemed kind of into reading that book.


AUSTIN: He takes a long drink.


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): The University?


AUSTIN: He says, and his eyes go wide. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): That’s impossible, there’s not, no one’s left from the University.


JACK (as Lem): (laughs) Look.


KEITH (as Fero): It’s, well, he’s a tenacious little dude.


JACK (as Lem): Look, Greggy-


(AUSTIN laughs)


AUSTIN: I like that you’re a halfling, talking about Fantasmo as “a little dude” it’s really good.


JACK (as Lem): He’s, he’s not a great guy, Greggy.


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): I’ll have to look into this. Well, what’s his name? 


KEITH (as Fero): Tazzy- Fantasmo, Fantasmo. 


JACK (as Lem): Wait, Keith, ah, sorry Fero are you sure about that?


KEITH (as Fero): Yeah. 


AUSTIN: It’s too late now, certainly. 


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): I see, I’ll talk to some friends and see what they know. Two weeks, three weeks maximum I’ll be back. (KEITH: Ok.) If you can be here I’ll- (excited noise)


AUSTIN: He slips a ring off of his finger and hands it to you. It has, the symbol on it is kind of three vertical dashes all at a different height. The first one is kind of like mid-level, the second one is really high and the bottom one is the lowest of the three. 


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): Give this to whoever, show this to whoever you need. My word is good for it, they’ll know that I have sent you and that I can pay. 


KEITH (as Fero): Wait, who?


AUSTIN (as Gregalos): Horses, ships, whatever you need to get there. 


KEITH (as Fero): What? You’re popular. 


JACK (as Lem): Okay. Alright. 


(overlapping)
KEITH (as Fero): Yeah, we’re in.
JACK: We’re on, I’m gonna shake hands with him. 


KEITH: Yep.


AUSTIN: You shake hands and the second you do, the doors open. And in come two men in hoods, or two forms- figures in hoods and a couple of Guards-


(bell rings three times)


JACK: It’s gonna do this twelve times. 


AUSTIN: The bell rings outside. 


(laughing)


AUSTIN: The Guards-


KEITH: This doesn’t sound like a good thing, when Guards come into a place at a particular time.


AUSTIN: No. (bell continues to ring) They’re combing the room. 


JACK: I think we should probably do something here, Hella.


AUSTIN: You can overhear, you can overhear that the Guards are saying “Listen, they’re not here, this is just a neighborhood bar”. And the forms in robes, not robes just hoods they’re kind of like armored? With cloaks and hoods. 


KEITH: Okay.


AUSTIN: Big, like strong bodies. Seem insistent, that what they want is here. They are, let’s say, thirty feet away from you at this point. You’re in a back booth near the bar and there’s like a stairwell up to the room that Lem rented last night. What do you do?


KEITH: Well we probably don’t want to go talk to them, right? 


ALI: No.


KEITH: We probably want to leave?


JACK: Oh, wait I have high charisma stat so if you want me to take a fall for this I could probably get some sensation of, of what’s going on. It’s a risk I’d be willing to take. 


AUSTIN: So what are you asking, what are you saying you want to do?


JACK: I’m saying, I’m saying to Hella and Fero that if conversation with them (AUSTIN: Uh-huh.) is something that we’re at least vaguely interested in (AUSTIN: Mhm) I would be prepared to take a shot at it, if they want to hide. From Lem’s perspective this is kind of, this is sort of the inverted commas “combat situation” that he feels most comfortable in. 


AUSTIN: Mhm.


KEITH: I also, I also think that other than, outside a scenario where someone has said “Guards come in, they’re looking around and you notice a back door”, other than that I’d feel like we haven’t done anything wrong, specifically.


AUSTIN: Right. 


KEITH: So unless they’re looking for the ring that was just handed to us.


AUSTIN: Right. 


KEITH: By a mysterious man named Greggy. 


JACK: Alright.


KEITH: Then we’re, we’re probably, yeah we’re, and also I’m not afraid of some Guards.  


AUSTIN: Yeah, that’s fair.


KEITH: I’m a goddamn druid. 


JACK: The question is if we want to confront them do we just straight, go at it, with an orcish bard, a barbarian and a druid or do we go at it more carefully, at least initially, I don’t know. Austin, am I still- am I still scarred? 


AUSTIN: Yeah, you’ve not had time to recover.


JACK: Ok. Still no thing. 


KEITH: Do you-


(ALI laughs)


AUSTIN: Yeah, they are, so- so, for people who are listening, reminder that Lem was scarred when he put that mask on his face and saw some visions of some royal figure last week.


JACK: Also, Hadrian crowned me, right? 


AUSTIN: He did. That didn’t leave the scar though, the mask did. 


JACK: No, but that was, I would like it to go on record, that was also deeply uncomfortable. 


(KEITH and ALI laugh)


AUSTIN: Yeah, you both had a real experience there. 


JACK: We had an experience. 


AUSTIN: A mixed bag. 


JACK: Actually-


KEITH: Well now you’re a ghost king. 


JACK: (laughs) Dude. 


(ALI laughs)


JACK: Yeah, I feel a bit weird to be honest that Hadrian is- I feel like Hadrian and I went through a lot and now we’re in completely different-


AUSTIN: Mhm.


JACK: Different bits of the world. But, anyway! That’s not the, that’s not the, that’s not the matter right now. What do we want to do? 


KEITH: I kinda want to listen in before we- I want to like, kind of, just hang out, not be too conspicuous and see if we can hear what they’re saying. 
ALI: Yeah, I don’t think we should confront them. I like, I gesture to the others to keep their heads down but otherwise-


KEITH: Yeah, I’m not, I’m more interested in figuring out what is going on here.


AUSTIN: So you’re trying to listen in.


KEITH: I don’t think that needs to be through talking to them yet. 


AUSTIN: Okay. 


JACK: I wanna talk to them. But, I, y’know, I-


AUSTIN: Well, you can, you can do that while- So, let’s, let’s handle this with Lem and, or sorry with Fero first. Yeah, Fero sounds like he wants to Discern Realities to me.


KEITH: Yep. 


AUSTIN: So go ahead and roll plus WIS and-


KEITH: Got it!


AUSTIN: And we’ll see what happens there.


JACK: Extra WIS.


(ALI laughs, quietly)


AUSTIN: Okay, good, so you got a, you now get to ask, you rolled an eleven. He gets to ask questions from that sheet, from that move. I think three questions from that? 


KEITH: Yeah, yeah. I’m gonna start with, what is about to happen? 


AUSTIN: These men are going to find you, are going to find Lem. 


KEITH: Oh, shit, okay. What here is useful or valuable to me? 


AUSTIN: Well, you haven’t paid the server yet for this very expensive bottle of wine, that’s pretty valuable. You have the ring already, and the, the stairs up are striking you as a pretty nice place to be.


KEITH: And, and what here is not as it appears to be?


AUSTIN: Greggy. 


KEITH: Okay.


AUSTIN: Also the, the people in the kind of cloaks. But, but yeah.


KEITH: Okay. 


AUSTIN: Also, Hella is evil. 


(JACK laughs)


KEITH: Right. (laughs) 


AUSTIN: I say that because she doesn’t appear to be, right, like! 


KEITH: She does not appear to be evil. 


JACK: We kind of all know this by now, right?


KEITH: She has yet to appear- Yeah. 


JACK: This is something that we’ve, we’re comfortable with.


KEITH: I feel like-


ALI: No, I don’t think Hadrian like, told everyone. 


(overlapping)
AUSTIN: No, but, but-
JACK: We just decided that-


AUSTIN: They must have seen you at some point hurt a person, in combat, like do you remember your first love letter was about killing those pirates? I have to imagine they’ve seen-


ALI: Well, just, I’m good at that.


AUSTIN: Yeah…


ALI: That’s not evil.


AUSTIN: Well then at some point we have to wonder if that’s the right alignment for her then, do you know what I mean?


ALI: Yeah. 


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Like, you can see in their movements why Hadrian and Fantasmo are lawful? Do you know what I mean? You can see it like, often. Like they both are letter of the law type, in it for power, in it for stability, the status quo, etcetera. So, I- Think about it going forward, if this is the right alignment choice for Hella. And I will make sure there are opportunities for it to be illustrated, is what I’ll say. 


JACK: Fero-


KEITH: So I’m gonna, I’m gonna-


JACK: Fero, are you communicating this to us?


KEITH: Yeah, yeah, I’m communicating it to you, again.


JACK: I no longer want to talk to these people.  


KEITH: Okay, and, fucking, is Greggy still here?


AUSTIN: Greggy left like very quietly, in this moment. 


KEITH: Fuck, shit, ah, goddamnit. 


AUSTIN: He kind of like, wait wait, he kind of, again, while you were listening he kind of does one of those things where like, he stood up and patted you on the shoulder a little bit? Do you know what I mean like-


KEITH: So he wasn’t trying to sneak out.


AUSTIN: No, he didn’t sneak out. He knew you were, yeah, yeah. 


(overlapping)
AUSTIN: He gave you a kind of like-
JACK: It’s just like, “Alright, peace.”


AUSTIN: “Peace,” like, “It’s time for us to all go and all slip out of this the way we need to” and “we’re in this together” sort of pat. 


KEITH: Okay, so I, I definitely would like to leave this place with Hella and Lem. 


AUSTIN: Okay, I think Lem has to be the one here to really try to lead the sneak out, unless you’re going in opposite directions which, really like, Lem is the one in danger, is what I’m gonna say. So, how do you guys try to get out of this room, starting with Lem?


JACK: Fero, so the stuff we revealed about things that are not what they seem to be was the hooded creatures, right? The, the hooded figures. 


(overlapping)
KEITH: The hooded figures yeah.
AUSTIN: Also Greggy. 


KEITH: Also Greggy.


JACK: Also Greggy, and also Hella. 


AUSTIN: Yeah. 


JACK: Austin, did, was that all, was that all that Ke- The question is what here is not what it appears to be-


AUSTIN: Yeah, what is not-


(crosstalk between AUSTIN, JACK and KEITH)


KEITH: I could, I mean, I don’t know what your- what-


JACK: If these-


KEITH: If this ends up being a roll, of some kind, for you to try to sneak out of here, Jack, I don’t know what your- I mean, I don’t know what the roll is gonna end up being, but maybe dexterity and I don’t think you have a high DEX, right?


JACK: I have a, I have a pretty, pretty damn average DEX. 


KEITH: Okay. Eh, we’ll probably be fine. 


JACK: So, I’m really really curious about these hooded figures, but there’s- If they’re searching for me I think it’s probably in my best interest that I leave.


AUSTIN: How are you leaving? (small pause) So for one, on that matter, one, how are you leaving? Two, Fero and Hella, are you leaving, also, at this moment?


KEITH: Unless, Hella, unless you want to stay here and listen with me and, so that I’ve got, someone’s got my back in case they attack me for being near Lem, since he left? But I think, I think Ja-, yeah I think we’re gonna leave, we’re gonna leave probably. 


ALI: I mean, we can like stay and if they question us I can be like “Oh we didn’t see him.”


JACK: Is there any chance?


ALI: If he needs cover while he sneaks out.


JACK: Yeah, would you mind if I asked that of you? We haven’t known each other for very long, well Fero, I mean, we’re bros.


KEITH: No, yeah we’re cool. 


ALI: No I can take them. 


JACK: Fero, I’m particularly curious about the, about the hooded figures, in particular. But, like, that’s, that’s super great of you, thank you. 


KEITH: Yeah, I’ll, I hang b-


JACK: You don’t have to do this. So, I go over to the bartender, who, presumably, I’ve been getting on alright with? Based on what we established earlier? And I’d like to tap him on the shoulder and be like:


JACK (as Lem): l Hey, is there a, is there a way out that’s not, not through the front entrance, you know. If a show goes bad or if the patrons are being a bit rowdy, you know, is there, is there a way out here? 


42:40


AUSTIN (as the bartender): (deep breath) You could, I mean, you could take your chances through the front door and just kind of like - 


AUSTIN: Do you have anything covering your face? I’m going to say this room is fairly dark, but like it’s not like its been - 


JACK: No, I don’t think so. 


AUSTIN: If you -- yeah. (deep breath) I guess again, so there’s a bunch of ways you can do this. If you’re trying to slip out quietly, the stairs probably make the most sense to you. But, like, that requires being on the rooftops, there isn’t a nice way down from upstairs.


JACK: Hmmm. 


AUSTIN: And you’re not sure if they’ll go check upstairs. Maybe they won’t. Maybe you could just hide up out there for the rest of the night and be fine.


JACK: I think I’m going to try and go upstairs, but before I go, I’d just like to tip the bartender a wink, you know, like, ‘thanks for putting up with me and all this bullshit.’


AUSTIN: Right.


(a pause)


JACK: So what do you want me to roll?


AUSTIN: Nothing, 


JACK: Would you like me to roll?


AUSTIN: You go upstairs, that’s fine. You slip upstairs quickly, in this case --  (louder) Actually, hmm, 


JACK: Okay.


AUSTIN: These guys are really good. Yeah, let’s go ahead and roll.


(ALI laughs)


AUSTIN: Are you trying to do it quickly? Or like, I guess DEX is probably the thing here, is what you said.


JACK: I’m trying to do it quickly and quietly.


AUSTIN: Yeah, thats DEX.


JACK: Okay, here we go.


AUSTIN: That’s 2d6 plus DEX, I keep - I just left the page, that was a mistake, okay. 


JACK: So that’s, my DEX score is 0, so (laughs)


AUSTIN: Yup, straight 2d6. 


(Audible keyboard click)


JACK: Oh - (laughs)


AUSTIN: But not like that. 


KEITH (laughing): Nope. 


JACK: Shhh… 7.


AUSTIN: Okay. So with defy danger, whoops, one second, wuh-oh… why did I lose everything? Oh oh oh, sorry, I have to clear this-


JACK: Is that an existential question? 


AUSTIN (dramatic voice): Yeah, I’ve Lost It All (back to normal voice) No, I’m okay, I just, my web page got all weird for a second. Okay, so you can - let me look at your sheet really quick.


JACK: I’ve forgotten you can do that. This is like the conductor being able to see the score for all the other musicians in the orchestra.


AUSTIN: It is, it’s very useful.


JACK (as a conductor): I can see the clarinet part.


AUSTIN: You can get away quickly, but you’ve already left the table when you realize that your fiddle in its case is still on the table.


JACK: Oh no! 


AUSTIN: So you get away. You can go upstairs fine, if you want. Or you can go back for the fiddle 


JACK (determined): I’m going back for that fiddle. 


KEITH: Wait - do I notice the fiddle? 


AUSTIN: Sure, yeah - I mean, it’s still on the table, yeah. 


KEITH: If I were to grab it and like, sling it across my back, would Lem notice and be okay with that? Or


AUSTIN: That’s up to - you tell me, do you do that?


KEITH: Yeah, I’m gonna do that.


AUSTIN: Okay. Lem, when you turn back around, when you realize it, you see - 


KEITH: And then I’m going to turn my back, I’m going to turn my back so it’s facing Lem. So that if he wants to come up and grab it, he can do that. 


JACK (quietly hums and laughs): I trust Fero. I’m gonna make a move.  


AUSTIN: Okay.


JACK: You know, on the hand I put a lot on the line for this instrument and I care a lot about it. That’s why I stole it. But at the same time (pause) the thing that i’m losing is just the way to play the music. I can play the music on other stuff. 


AUSTIN: Sure. You’ll figure it out. 


JACK: Yeah. It’s just a violin. 


AUSTIN: And hey - it’s Fero.


JACK: Yeah, you know, I trust Fero a lot.


KEITH: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Okay, so you go upstairs. (pause)  Is that what you’re saying?


JACK: Yes, that’s what I’m saying.


AUSTIN: I wasn’t 100% sure. So, you go upstairs and it’s the same room you stayed in the night before which is a fairly - not quaint, what is the word I’m looking for - just like


KEITH: Sparse? 


JACK: Homely? 

AUSTIN: Those are both good words. Like, there’s not much here. You don’t carry much with you and they don’t provide much here, but there is a kind of care put into what is there that makes you feel safe the second you step upstairs. On the other hand, soon the cloaked figures and the Guards come over to you. You guys can tell immediately - Hella and Fero can tell immediately that the Guards don’t really - they feel like this is a waste of their time, there aren’t that many Guards in this town, do they really have to be out looking for some Orc Bard, ya know?


KEITH: Yeah, yeah. 


AUSTIN: So one of the Guards steps forward, with kind of a sigh, and his hand is like low, near his sword but not in an aggressive manner. In a kind of a dutiful manner. 


KEITH: Yeah


AUSTIN (as the Guard): Sorry to bother you fine folks this evening, we’re out, we’re looking for a man, he’s an orc about yea high, two tusks, you know, has a fiddle, very noticeable man. Not many orcs play the fiddle, Ha! 


(ALI giggles)


        AUSTIN (as the Guard): Have you seen anything, have you seen anybody like this?


        KEITH (as Fero): Nah, was he with anyone?


AUSTIN (as the Guard): Yeah, he was with a group of people, I mean, he worked, did some good work the other day I hear. But, uh - 


AUSTIN: And one of the figures kind of like looks over at him, and you can see underneath the cloaks on the hooded figures is, one of them has like, not shiny - but like, metallic? In my mind, there’s matte, there’s the kind of like shiny, pearlescent and stuff - but in between there, there’s a kind of natural sheen to metal. He has on like black plate armor, and the other person has on lots of leather straps and bags, very similar in wear to what Lem wears normally.


KEITH: Okay.


AUSTIN: And under the cloaks you can see their faces are larger than human faces, a bit.


KEITH: Alright.


AUSTIN: You suspect these are orcs. 


KEITH (as Fero): Yeah, we just came up from Rosemarrow, this is my companion, so we haven’t been here long. We’re just stopping in, taking a drink.


AUSTIN (as the Guard): Ah you’re both from Rosemarrow then?


KEITH (as Fero): I’m from Rosemarrow, she’s just coming with me.


AUSTIN (as the Guard): Where were you? Where are you from? What were you doing down in Rosemarrow?


ALI (as Hella): Just hanging out with this guy. 


AUSTIN (as the Guard): Ahhh, you two young lovers, I see how it is, you went for a halfling, huh? 


AUSTIN: And he gives you a little, like


KEITH: I give him a wink, and I kind of nudge him, like “Eh?”


(ALI giggles)


ALI: I shrug, casually. 


AUSTIN: Give me - it sounds like what is, is defy danger, charisma?


KEITH: Okay


AUSTIN: Lets do a, lets do a - definitely Fero, but then but then if you’d like to aid/interfere, it  sounds like you’re aiding this


KEITH: I would love to be aided since I do not have a charisma modifier. 


AUSTIN: Sure. So, who’s this first roll? That’s a good roll 


KEITH: That’s me. 11. Great.


AUSTIN: Well, then we don’t even need to roll that aid. 


KEITH: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: So yeah, you’ve defied - they are - the soldier at this point is kind of like - Oh, alright. Okay I’m happy with this. Let’s get out of here and stop bugging these people. In fact, that’s what he says to the two orcs that he’s with - 


AUSTIN (as the Guard): Uh, let’s stop bugging these people, let’s get out of here. A nice place like this, you won’t find your boy here


AUSTIN: So they turn and leave. Upstairs, Lem, you can see them from your window sneaking away. Outside, the larger one takes his hood off and you immediately recognize him as Morbash. Who is -


KEITH: That’s a good name 


JACK: Good name. 


AUSTIN: - who is one of the curators - I’m trying to think of a good name for what this group does. Like, they’re basically repo men. Right, they go out -  


JACK: Oh! 


AUSTIN: So like, Reclaimment or something? What do you - do you have a name for this?


JACK: Yeah - I’ve been calling them the collectors? But, I think colloquially they’re called the Armed Wing.


AUSTIN: Yeah, okay.


JACK: Because they’re the orcs that, you know, do their business, without charisma rolls, lets say.


(Keith laughs)


AUSTIN: Yeah, that’s fair. So you recognize the large one in the plate armor as that. 


JACK: Is he the leader of the collector troupe? 


AUSTIN: No -- Yeah, he’s the leader of a collector troupe, exactly. But he goes off on his own often to do this sort of like, 


JACK: Do I have a history with him?


AUSTIN: I don’t know, do you?


JACK (laughing): Are you not supposed to answer that? 


AUSTIN: Nah, we’re supposed to answer that, ya know? 


KEITH: Sorry Jack, what was the question? 


JACK: Do I have a history with Morbash.


KEITH: Oh, yeah. 


JACK: As a collector?


KEITH: Do you?


JACK: I don’t think of Lem as necessarily a collector, or perhaps? 


AUSTIN (overlapping): No, but you’ve lived in this place so it’s feasible, right, right.  


JACK (overlapping): Plus he’s comparatively young as well, so I think a lot of Lem’s politics are pretty - not necessarily well defined yet.  


AUSTIN: Sure, sure. You might know him as - you certainly know him as a public figure in the New Archive, right?


JACK: Yeah - I think maybe I - I think maybe I went to one of his talks once? He gave a talk, because of course, you know - (overlapping) even though he’s a collector, he’s an archivist through and through.


AUSTIN (overlapping): Sure, sure. Even the Armed Wing. Yeah, right, right. 


JACK: And I think I went to one of his talks, and he signed a book of mine afterwards. And I remember disagreeing with a great deal of what he was saying. But I think deep down part of me was kind of excited to see him talking. 


(Loud typing sounds. A pause)


AUSTIN: Taking notes, sorry, as always.


JACK (laughs): That’s okay.


AUSTIN: Yeah I like that, I like that a lot. Well, now he’s hunting for you, so.


JACK (sarcastically): Yeah, gee, great. 


(KEITH and JACK laugh)


AUSTIN: You know - here’s a thing you know about him from reputation alone: he won’t stop. He knows you’re here, in this city at least.  


JACK: So I’m pretty freaked out by this. 


AUSTIN: And he’s likely accounted for - you know, by this time tomorrow, there won’t be a way out. The news will be closed, you know? 


JACK: Alright, yeah. 


AUSTIN: So if you’re going to leave, it has to be now. And you have to figure out how to make that happen. You have that thought in your head upstairs. 


JACK: I have to figure out? Or everybody has to figure out? 


AUSTIN: I mean - You have that thought, in your head upstairs, you think, 


AUSTIN as Lem: I have to get out of here, we - I have to figure this out, we have to figure this out, whatever.


AUSTIN: So, they’ve left, everyone can go upstairs, everyone can be together again if you’d like to plan this out


KEITH: Yup. 


JACK: I’m sorry - Is there any chance I could really quickly go to the bathroom and Keith could edit this stupid bit out? 


AUSTIN: Sure, sounds good. 


KEITH: Sure. 


(ALI laughs)


JACK: Keith, I don’t believe you.


AUSTIN: I’m going to eat another cookie. 


KEITH: No, I’m totally going to edit it out.


JACK (more emphatically): Keith, I don’t believe you.


KEITH (also more emphatically): I’m gonna edit it out! 


ALI: There’s not going to be something interesting here.


(Cookie packing is crinkling near the mic)


JACK: Keith, raise your right hand - Ugh, Keith has done this before.


KEITH: Right hand raised. Right Hand Raised! 


(ALI laughs) 


JACK: Alright, one second. 


KEITH: Okay (pause) Wait, am I not gonna, like, swear an oath? I have this hand raised


(ALI laughs) 


AUSTIN (laughing): He just wants you to hold your hand up.


KEITH (laughing): He just wants me to hold my hand up. I’m holding it up, I swear I am. I - oh, that’s what I’ll swear. 


(AUSTIN and ALI laugh)


KEITH (officially): I swear, upon my right raised hand that my right raised hand is raised.


ALI: This is hilarious, you can’t cut this out.


AUSTIN (laughing): Now you have to leave it in. 


KEITH: No, I have to.


AUSTIN: You have to leave it in now. 


KEITH: I can’t, I promised that I would cut it out. 


ALI: Yeah, your promises don’t mean that much. 


KEITH: They mean a ton! My word is oak. My word is my bond.


(ALI laughs. AUSTIN hums disapprovingly.)


ALI: Nope.


KEITH: Yeah! Why - it’s like, okay - hold on. Why do I have this reputation all of a sudden?


(ALI laughs)


AUSTIN: You didn’t cut that thing out of the first episode.


ALI: Yeah.


KEITH: I just… forgot all about it.


AUSTIN: Yep.

ALI: Sure. 


KEITH: What was it - what was it that I said I would cut out? 


ALI: Austin messing up the outro, I think?


AUSTIN: That sounds right.


ALI: Yeah. He like, started speaking and just jumbled it. And then we were like “we’ll cut this” and then we started again but it’s all on there.


KEITH: Oh! Yeah yeah yeah. Well, what my plan was -


AUSTIN: Uh huh? 


KEITH: to make like, an edit noise, like I was gonna edit it out, but then leave it in anyway. So I was just going to do a higher production version of not editing it out. (laughs) Or maybe cut it out and put it after the outro song.


ALI: and… that’s why we all think that you’re a liar.


AUSTIN: That’s why. 


KEITH (dejectedly): I’m not a liar. 


ALI: Uh huh


AUSTIN: mmmm hmmmm 


KEITH: Wait, you said ‘that’s why’ like that wasn’t why, like there’s more.


(ALI and AUSTIN laugh)


JACK: Sorry about that.


AUSTIN: Welcome back. Keith’s been holding his hand up in the air for you. 


JACK: Ah-- seriously? 


KEITH: Yeah I have not put it down yet, because you had me raise my hand but didn’t have me swear some oath.


JACK: Well, I mean, you know - that’s why I trust you. It was just a hand raising oath, really. 


AUSTIN (excitedly): It was!  


KEITH: That’s what I did when you left! I did a hand raising oath! 


JACK: Also, I just wanted to - 


KEITH: I swear by my right raised hand that my hand raised - my right hand raised - my right right - 


JACK: Is this a tongue twister?


AUSTIN: Yup. Uh huh.


KEITH: - right raised hand is raised - it is now. It wasn’t when I first said it, it was off the cuff.


JACK: I also just wanted to say that like, this is super cool. This is a fun activity to do with friends.


AUSTIN (laughing): It is.


ALI: Yeah - this is fun and good. 

KEITH: Yup.


JACK (laughing): Fun And Good.

AUSTIN: So how are you going to escape from being murdered?


JACK: Wait - 


(JACK laughs)


KEITH: I want to leave now. I want to show it to a - I want to use that ring, show it to a dude. Get


JACK: Wait, who has the ring? 


KEITH (quietly): I have the ring.


AUSTIN: I think Fero has the ring.


JACK: Okay. Um - 


AUSTIN: But let’s say you’re all together, you’re all together in the bedroom that Lem had rented. But you’ll have to come up with a plan, like - how, so so - okay, I’m gonna - do you guys want to see the world map or the local map?


KEITH: Local map.


AUSTIN: Okay, you’re on the local map currently. You should be, anyway.


KEITH: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: You are - let me drop a - let me see if I can get like a, make a little mark really quick. Make sure I’m on the right - this system is really cool because there are different layers. Right now I’m on the objects and tokens layer. 


(ALI laughs)


AUSTIN: I can just do like, a nice little, lets see here - 


JACK: This is the segment for Austin Geeking Out About Roll20 


(ALI laughs)


AUSTIN: Yeah - you guys are there, let’s say.


KEITH: Okay. 


JACK: Oh god, this is actually pretty cool. 


AUSTIN: Yeah - I know. And, I mean, you have a bunch of ways to try to leave this space. 


KEITH: Yeah and - 


AUSTIN: I drew - for people listening (laughs), I drew a red X near the main thoroughfare through the Fish district which is the main - where people live, where people work in Velas at this point, but just off the side of it a little bit.


KEITH: How would you guys feel about heading to the west docks, getting a boat to the fields? Getting a boat going through that sort of area, past - circumventing the rest of the burg and going to, kind of swooping into the fields, getting dropped off there and then heading back onto the main road? 


ALI: That sounds good, we should stay - 


AUSTIN: Actually, one second - I do just want to show you all the big map, so you can think about your long-term plan here too. And I’ll just kind of narrate different - not narrate, but 


KEITH: Okay -


JACK: Also - 


AUSTIN: So, you’re in Velas now, the north-west corner of this map. This map is available at friendsatthetable.net for people to see - and I’ll also try and put it in the YouTube video that you can find at Streamfriends.tv - 


JACK: It’s an amazing map.


AUSTIN: It is.


KEITH: It’s a great map. 


AUSTIN: One of my favorite thing about this map - so, Jeanine Hawkins, who you can find at twitch.tv/bleatingheart or at twitter.com/bleatingheart. B-L-E-A-T-I-N-G heart - is the way this north west quadrant looks like a face? It’s my fave. It’s my favorite thing. She didn’t do it on purpose but - 


KEITH (overlapping): Oh! The nose, the nose coming out, I see that. Yeah! 


AUSTIN (overlapping): The nose, and the mouth, and Velas is in the forehead, do you see that? Effectively you could - there’s a lot of ways down to that red mark. So there’s a red mark down where the forest is on this map, which is at the zoom level we’re in, one two -- so, Velas takes up a whole tile, let’s say. Right?


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: And then like one, two, three, four, five -  Six tiles down, and three tiles over, or two tiles over. So it’s a pretty -


KEITH: We could - 


AUSTIN: -  big distance. So the ways that I think you could go - there’s a bunch of ways you could go.


KEITH: Yeah, it looks like the two easiest ways, because we don’t want to pass through the Mark of the Erasure, probably. 


[One Hour]


AUSTIN: No, no.


KEITH: So it looks like the two easiest ways, probably south of Velas, and then east, over towards Rosemarrow -  or maybe like sort of a diagonal southeast kind of movement. Or going - taking a boat between the coast - between Ordenna and the main continent shore, and then hit the coast, because Rosemarrow is also on the coast.


(Sounds of agreement from AUSTIN and JACK)


JACK: I have a bonus to perilous - I have a map of this northwest quadrant. 


AUSTIN: That will help regardless of which way you go. 


JACK: Oh, okay.


AUSTIN: That - both of those ways will help with that roll. So yeah, you could rent a boat and take it down this straight, kind of. For listeners, Ordenna is kind of an Island that runs along this whole northwestern coast of the continent of Hieron. And it stops kind of at the chin of this face, if that makes sense? It’s kind of like a face in profile is how I kind of see it. About four tiles south of Velas is where it stops, and there’s a straight that runs between the continent and the island of Ordenna that they could definitely take a boat down. And yeah, you could also just - you know, Fero, that there are roads that run between - there’s kind of one major road that runs between Velas and Rosemarrow. 


JACK (as Lem): I don’t want to take that road. 


AUSTIN: But you haven’t been on it in a long time. Both of these - there are also other ways that you would be kind of - there are ways you could be kind of stealthy about going down that way? Like, I’m sure Fero in his many adventures has been up and down that way.


JACK (as Lem): Fero,  


KEITH (as Fero): Yeah, I know all about this area. 


JACK (as Lem): How much do you know about Morbash? I know you spent time with us, but - 


KEITH (as Fero): I mean, I mostly - since I mostly lived - I didn’t live inside the thing with you guys -


JACK (as Lem, laughing): ‘the thing’ - you’re talking about my home here.


KEITH (as Fero): I kind of hung out on my own. Yeah, I didn’t hang out in that place, in your cave, in your big cave thing that you guys got. 


(AUSTIN laughs disapprovingly)


ALI: Oh, boy.


KEITH: No no no no, hold on, this is - Jack very specifically said that the New Archives was ‘hollowed out into the side of a mountain.’


JACK: That’s different to ‘your cave’


(AUSTIN and ALI laugh)


AUSTIN: It’s pretty different. 


JACK: Keith, the actual house that I’m living in right now is not hollowed out, but it is just stone built into some rectangles. But I wouldn’t call it a stone rectangle cave. 


KEITH (as Fero): No, but like, I’m not saying - listen, all I had, was the fuckin’ - I slept on a rock.


(JACK laughs) 


KEITH (as Fero): I slept on a rock on top of your cave.


JACK (as Lem): How much do you know about Morbash? 


KEITH (as Fero): I don’t really know anything about Morbash. 


JACK (as Lem): Alright, so here’s what I’m - 


KEITH (as Fero): I’ve seen Morbash and his - and the collectors. I see them leaving and coming from the Archives, always traveling in groups, always traveling with big, heavy armor and angry looking weapons. 


JACK (as Lem, seriously): Okay, so I’m gonna tell you right now that these guys mean business. They absolutely mean business in a big way. We have whole sections of the Archives dedicated to political documents about whether or not their actions are justified. And not their actions as a group? Like, loads of these documents are about Morbash. So, (deep breath) what I’m saying is - 


KEITH (as Fero): I - well, here 


JACK (as Lem): what I’m saying is - Fero, in planning for this, we can’t just travel here like its - like, you know - they’re going to be thinking about how we’re going to be traveling here, and I wanted to convey that to you. 


KEITH (as Fero): Well, they think you’re in the city?


JACK (as Lem): Uh, I don’t know.


ALI (as Hella): Well, 


KEITH (as Fero): I would say that prob - the safest way, in terms of not getting caught, is taking a boat. But the safest way, in terms of not, you know, crashing and sinking and drowning, is to not take a boat. 


(JACK laughs)


        ALI (as Hella): I travel those seas all the time, we’ll be fine. 


KEITH (as Fero, sing-song): I don’t like oceans.


        ALI (as Hella, sing-song): We’ll be fine.


        KEITH (as Fero, sing-song): It’s not a fun thing for me.


JACK (as Lem): I’m tempted to go with Hella here, if only because overland is something that I - that I find discomforting. Also, I don’t know how much Morbash has researched the people we’ve been traveling with? He might know that Fero is not particularly fond of oceans, which might mean (laughing) that traveling by ocean is actually our best bet.


 ALI (as Hella): Yeah - bottom line here - 


KEITH (as Fero): Well, I think that if - if they knew that you were traveling with me, a halfling that looks all, with like leaves everywhere and hasn’t showered ever.


AUSTIN: Oh boy. 


KEITH (as Fero): and a super tall fighter who has a very specific sword, i think that they might have been more suspicious of us, of a halfling and a fighter hanging out. 


 ALI (as Hella): Well, no no no, we have to stay off the roads. 


JACK (as Lem): We have to.


 ALI (as Hella): And also, if they are looking for us, you told that guy where you’re from. 


(ALI and JACK laugh) 
        
        JACK (as Lem): You literally did.


 ALI (as Hella): They’re going to be looking for us on those roads, specifically. 


JACK (as Lem): This is going to be a raising of the Shire situation. 


KEITH (as Fero): But they, but they - no no no, but they don’t - they - I - 


(AUSTIN laughs loudly, JACK laughs)


KEITH (as Fero): A random stranger that has no connection to this whole thing said that he was from Rosemarrow. Right? Like, they didn’t leave that going (GUARD voice) ‘That’s the guy!’ (normal voice) Like, they didn’t - 


AUSTIN: No, but you know, you know how these people are. 


         ALI (as Hella): But they might put two and two together.


AUSTIN: Right. 


 ALI (as Hella): They could ask someone else, who could (overlapping)


JACK (as Lem, overlapping): If there is one thing orcs are good at doing, it’s putting two and two together.


AUSTIN (overlapping): I mean, I mean, listen. Here’s what you - you all know, for a fact, that at - you could put together clearly that those are city guards, being forced to work with the New Archivists. Which means anything the city knows, the New Archivists will know quickly. They might not know it yet - but they have access to that information. (a pause) Do you know what I mean?


KEITH (as Fero): I mean, we can take a boat if you guys want. But boats are stupid, and we could walk. 


ALI (as Hella): I vote boat. 


JACK (as Lem, overlapping): I vote boat. I vote boat.


ALI (as Hella, overlapping): I can protect you guys. It’ll be fine.


AUSTIN: Alright, alright, lets - 


KEITH (as Fero, overlapping): You can’t protect us from big old - 


JACK (as Lem, overlapping): Plus, from a practical perspective - 


AUSTIN: Uh-huh - okay.


KEITH (as Fero): Here’s where you can protect us: you can protect us from people coming out, bandits and New Archivists, coming out with swords. You can’t protect us from a giant wave that breaks the boat and we sink and drown and die.


ALI (as Hella): We’re gonna be fine - I travel those seas literally all the time. 


AUSTIN: Okay, so you and - 


JACK (as Lem): Look, Fero, you know, I super trust Fero but at the same time I think Hella is absolutely talking sense here. 


AUSTIN: Okay, so - I guess the thing now is you have to get to a boat. We have to have a boat captain. How are you finding a boat captain? 


KEITH: I was thinking that we were going to sneak over to the west docks, find someone who looked like they were leaving, show them that ring, and be like ‘hey, we need to come with you, where are you going.’


AUSTIN: Sure. Okay, so you - 


KEITH: If we have - I tell them - 


KEITH (as Fero): If we need to wind up having to pay for this, I’m not paying, this was not my idea. 


(ALI and JACK laugh)


AUSTIN: You end up finding your way down to the west docks, which are a collection of docks - this map Isn’t final, the one you’re seeing now, Jeanine is, again, making us a really nice map of Velas, this is work-in-progress - and let’s say down near - you spend some time trying to find someone who’s leaving, but it’s so late at night that, like, very few people are doing that. But! In a little tavern - sorry, in a little pub - 


KEITH: - In a little cantina 


(AUSTIN laughs)


AUSTIN: You find an old friend of yours, Captain Calhoun. 


JACK: Oh, man. 


KEITH: Ah, Calhog. 


AUSTIN: He is pretty drunk. 


KEITH: Perfect! 


AUSTIN (as Calhoun, drunkenly): How ya guys doin?


AUSTIN: He has drunk away almost, probably, he also made 50 coin on that. 


KEITH: Yeah, I was gonna steal that from him.


AUSTIN: It might be gone already. You can tell, he’s pretty deep into it. It’s been two days of partying, boozing, feeling good.


(ALI laughs)


KEITH (as Fero): Buddy, how’s your ship?


AUSTIN (as Calhoun, drunkenly): Ah, Ah - it’s good, ya know, we patched it up. Bounced off a couple rocks there, everything, everything's good though. 




KEITH (as Fero): Can you - can we go take a load off - can we go take a look at it? 


AUSTIN (as Calhoun, drunkenly): Yeah - Boat Party!


KEITH (as Fero): Boat Party! We’re gonna have a fuckin’ Boat Party with Calhoun! 


(EVERYONE laughs)


AUSTIN: And he waves his hand with the people in the pub, like, to follow him? And your group goes with you to the boat, to his boat.


(ALI laughs)


KEITH (laughing): And the people in the pub are his crew? Not just people … in the pub


AUSTIN (avoiding): Good question. So you’re at the boat - 


ALI: Ah, boy.


KEITH (laughing): Okay. 


AUSTIN: And he kind of lights it up, and there’s like (referencing his own innuendo) yeah, he lights it up (laughs), no, he - lanterns are on, there is some singing, there is some dancing, and the boats in good shape! He seems socially lubricated.


KEITH (as Fero, excitedly): Fuckin - Calhoun! Do you want to go on a boat trip? Do you wanna take this thing out!? 


AUSTIN (as Calhoun, matching FERO’s excitement): Where do you wanna go? 


KEITH (as Fero, excitedly): Well, let’s fuckin go down to Rosemarrow! That place sounds nice.


AUSTIN (as Calhoun, less enthusiastic): Rosemarrow’s really far. I don’t - 


ALI (as Hella): No - 


KEITH (as Fero): It’ll be - but listen to the name (softly) Rosemarrow. Doesn’t that sound good? Rosemarrow.


AUSTIN (as Calhoun, matching FERO’s tone) Rosemarrow. 


ALI (as Hella): Do you want to make more money with us, bud? Come on? 


AUSTIN (as Calhoun): wha-wha-wha?


AUSTIN: He like, stops when Hella says “money.” He like, does a “Shhh” on Fero and pushes his finger up against Fero.


        KEITH (as Fero, whispers): He was going for it without money.


AUSTIN (as Calhoun): Money? Ah, (clears throat), Yes! What sort of - what sort of money - what sort of money are we talking?


        KEITH (as Fero): Well, that gold was cool, right? 


AUSTIN (as Calhoun): That gold was great. 


KEITH (as Fero): Gold is great! We’ll have some of that gold.


ALI (as Hella): Yeah - we’re going to a place, like last time (overlapping)


JACK (overlapping): Have we tried showing him the ring?


(a pause)


ALI: Oh. 


KEITH: I don’t think we even need to. 


JACK: Wait, no - If our options are “pay him money” or “show him a ring”


KEITH: Good point.


ALI: No no no no, we’re not paying him, I’m just saying 
        
ALI (as Hella, persuasively): We’re going to another place, like last time. We’re looking for a thing for a guy, there could be more gold? And if you take us, we’ll give you some. We’ll give you a better cut. 


AUSTIN (as Calhoun): There are only four of us this time (mumbles drunkenly) four of us this time. 


KEITH (as Fero): Yeah! There’s only four of us this time, which means you’ll get even more. 


AUSTIN (as Calhoun): Which means I get …. 4% cut. So, that sounds good.


ALI (as Hella) and AUSTIN (as Calhoun): Yeah! 


KEITH (as Fero): Exactly, you get FOUR percent 


AUSTIN (laughs): And he shakes your hand, like he’s making out 


(JACK and ALI laugh)


        KEITH (as Fero): Yeah! So, do you want to go to (same tone as before) Rosemarrow?


        AUSTIN (as Calhoun, matching FERO’s tone) Rosemarrow. 


KEITH (as Fero): Rosemarrow. 


AUSTIN (as Calhoun): What do we get, at Rosemarrow? 


KEITH (as Fero, same tone as “Rosemarrow”): Four percent of gold.


AUSTIN (as Calhoun, same tone): Four percent of Rosemarrow’s gold? 


KEITH (as Fero): Four percent of the gold we get from Rosemarrow. 


AUSTIN (as Calhoun, loudly): Alright, alright. Boat Party! 


(ALI laughs)


        KEITH (as Fero): Boat Party! 


AUSTIN: He calls again, and he does, like, a hand signal - 


KEITH: Any time he says “Boat Party!” I also yell “Boat Party” with him. 


(JACK, ALI and AUSTIN laugh)        


JACK: Okay, boss. 


AUSTIN: Alright, so you - 


JACK: I super love that Austin presented us with a character we needed to get us to do something, and (laughs) and I didn’t need to roll “charming and open” once.


AUSTIN (laughs): You know, it’s -


KEITH (laughs): He’s wasted.


AUSTIN: You’ve decided to be on a boat, captained by a super drunk dude. That’s on y’all, I dont - I mean, that’s fine.  


KEITH: Yeah yeah yeah…we’re good. 


JACK: Before we set off, could i - 


AUSTIN: Sure. 


        JACK (as Lem): Fero is there any - well, firstly, can I have my violin back, please?


KEITH (as Fero): Oh! yeah, of course, here. 


JACK (as Lem): Also, is there any - 


KEITH (as Fero): It’s very nice, by the way. 


JACK (as Lem, aggressively): Did you play it ?? Is it out of tune? 


KEITH (as Fero, defensively): no! I just took a look at it! 


ALI (as Hella): He didn’t play it, don’t worry.  


JACK (as Lem): Okay - it just takes hours to tune. Can I take a look at the ring, please?


KEITH (as Fero): Oh yeah! Here, here. 


JACK: So I’m going to reference my bardic lore on this, if possible. 


KEITH: I swear to god, I thought you were going to say “I’m going to...keep this.”


(EVERYONE laughs)


KEITH (laughing): I was like “wait - fuck you!”


JACK: I’m going to reference my bardic lore on this, please. I’d like to cast my mind back and see if in the documentation of heraldic symbols and sigils in the New Archives, I recognize this symbol on this ring. Is that a fair question?


AUSTIN: Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so. There’s no roll on this, right? You just get to know this? (overlapping) This is bardic lore, it’s just like you get this.


JACK (overlapping): No. Mhmm. You have to answer truthfully, Austin. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, I do. I’m trying to decide if you - if that place would know it. 


JACK: Yeah, I mean there’s a very good chance that I just don’t have anything in the Archives on it at all.


AUSTIN: Yeah, but there is something interesting here. You know this ring is too new for this to be true, Right? 


JACK: How do I know that?


AUSTIN: Based on the make of it. Right? Like, you know - You’ve held enough gold rings.


KEITH: the serial - you can tell from the serial code.


AUSTIN (laughing): You can tell from the make of it. It isn’t an ancient ring. 


JACK: Even though it’s masquerading being one. 


AUSTIN: It’s not masquerading being one - it’s not, at all - but the marking is from - you think some group of, elven... like, pre-fall, pre-erasure elven magic-users of some sort. They didn’t really... they weren’t… they weren’t like the new University exactly, but they were also interested in that sort of research. They weren’t a public group where you went and studied, do you know what I mean?


JACK: Right.


AUSTIN: They were kind of a secret research... circle - kind of like if you were part of an email ring today. 


(JACK laughs)


AUSTIN: Lot’s of letter sending, lot’s of shared research, kind of like a - the other thing would be like, in a university, you might find a group of researchers who is all part of one big research project? 


JACK: Okay.


AUSTIN: And they… I don't know how much the Archives know about what they were doing. But you know that it was that. And I think you probably even know what the three lines stand for.


JACK: What does it stand for? 


AUSTIN: Which are - it’s past, present and future.


JACK: Alright. So I’m going to share this information with everybody else. 


(AUSTIN makes a sound of affirmation)


JACK: Cool. 


(a pause)


        KEITH (as Fero): Yeah. Can I have the ring back? 


        JACK (as Lem): Yes, of course, of course. 


(AUSTIN laughs)


JACK (as Lem): Just, just, we know from Fero’s investigations earlier that Greggy wasn’t exactly what he seems to be, so I just wanted to share what I could get from this ring.


KEITH (as Fero): Yeah! I mean, dude maybe not what he seems to be, but also seems like an alright guy? I mean, he didn’t like, try to sneak out on us or shit.


(AUSTIN laughs)


JACK (as Lem): Right, dude - 


KEITH (as Fero):  Like, if he had tried to sneak out, I would be like a little bit worried.


JACK: Sure: But this is Dun- 


KEITH (as Fero):  But now I’m still, I still feel like he’s at least - even if he’s not on the level, he’s not on a level that is dangerous to us, and is probably still useful and helpful.


JACK: This is also Dungeon World, though. Run by Austin. And I don’t know if, quotes “Somebody being friendly” is the basic level for trusting them.


KEITH (as Fero):  Not that he’s friendly - he’s just - he didn’t try to immediately pull the wool over our eyes.


JACK (as Lem): That’s true, yeah.


ALI (as Hella): I mean, do we trust what he says? 


JACK: Not particularly. (laughing) I don’t.


KEITH (as Fero):  I, well, I trust that there’s another tower where he said there’s another tower and I want to go to another tower. 


ALI (as Hella): Okay - are we giving him this book?

(JACK and KEITH, simultaneously)
KEITH (as Fero):  Eh, I don’t know yet.
JACK (as Lem): My plan is to double cross him.


(ALI laughs)


AUSTIN: Do you say that openly, right here, with everybody?


JACK: Yes. Yes.


KEITH: With everybody? Or with just the three of us?


AUSTIN: Sorry, that’s what I - with just the three of you. Just the three of you


JACK: Okay.


KEITH:... I don’t know. What would you do with the book, Jack?


JACK (as Lem): It depends on our experience with it within the tower. You have to remember, I was pretty pro-destruction of the book in the tower. And so… I don’t know. I might feel the same way about this one.


ALI (as Hella): So long as you’re not giving it to Fantasmo, right?


JACK (as Lem): The two things that I am 100% planning on not doing are giving it to Fantasmo and giving it to the Archives. 


ALI (as Hella): Okay


KEITH (as Fero): Okay. Alright. That’s fair.


JACK (as Lem): Also, I could come round on not double-crossing this guy. I just - ya know


KEITH (as Fero): It depends, maybe we’ll learn something about him. Anyway, let’s go. 


(ALI laughs)


AUSTIN: Alright.


KEITH (as Fero, shouting): Calhoun! Boat Party! 


AUSTIN (as Calhoun): Boat Party!


KEITH (as Fero, shouting): Whoo! Boat Party! 


AUSTIN: He does a little spin of his finger, and you realize quickly that the way he says “Boat Party” communicates more than you thought. Like, this time when he says it, some people swing into action and start, okay! The sails are up, they’re leaving dock.


(KEITH laughs loudly)


AUSTIN: People are still drinking, people are still singing, this has been a really fun time for everybody, but it becomes clear pretty quickly that you are going to need to step up and become the people who actually run this journey.


KEITH: Yeah yeah yeah. Because everybody’s super drunk.


AUSTIN: and because, come day time, everyone is going to be super hung over also.


(ALI laughs)


KEITH: How many people does it take to run this boat?


ALI: Yeah, how many people are on the boat right now?


AUSTIN: I think - there’s probably 25 other people on this boat.


ALI: Are they - 


KEITH: And how many people does it take - what is the minimum amount to make them a usable boat?


AUSTIN: I don't know - 10? 15?


KEITH: 10? Okay, alright?


AUSTIN: You won’t run into trouble with the - (a thoughtful hmmm) the basic operations is not what’s 


KEITH: I’m gonna go around to people - 


AUSTIN: The basic operation is not what’s going to ruin this boat. They’ve done boat parties before, is what I’ll say 


(ALI laughs)


KEITH: Yeah, they’ve had a boat party.

AUSTIN: They’ve had a boat party.


ALI: Wait - are there any people on this boat right now who aren’t a part of this crew?


AUSTIN: Yeah - you realize that well after you’ve left dock. But, there are some men and women here who some of the other men and women of this boat have brought on for fun.


ALI: Oh - 


KEITH: Okay, I’m gonna tell those people “go to bed.”


(ALI JACK and AUSTIN laugh)


        AUSTIN (as a “Boat Party” guest, drunkenly): But we’re having fun! 


        KEITH (as Fero): No, it’s okay, go to bed, wake up - 


AUSTIN (as a “Boat Party” guest, drunkenly): No! 


KEITH (as Fero): - have a fuckin’ Sunrise Boat Party! If you go to bed now, Sunrise Boat Party!


AUSTIN (as a “Boat Party” guest, drunkenly): But if - What if we just take the Boat Party downstairs?


KEITH (as Fero): You want to go take the Boat Party downstairs?


AUSTIN (as a “Boat Party” guest, drunkenly): Let’s take the Boat Party downstairsssss


KEITH (as Fero): Take the Boat Party downstairs, there’s beds down there. Have a Sunrise Boat Party in a couple hours?


ALI (as Hella): Yeah, just do us a favor and stay downstairs.


AUSTIN: A nice - a very nice looking dude puts his arm around you, and give your head, your hair a little scrunch. 


        AUSTIN (as Hot Sailor, suggestively): Eh, beds downstairs, bud? You wanna, eh ?


(ALI laughs)


        KEITH (as Fero): Beds - 


AUSTIN: He gives you a little wink, and starts to like, pull you downstairs with them - 


        KEITH (as Fero): No nonononono. 


        AUSTIN (as Hot Sailor, confused): Eh? 


        KEITH (as Fero): Like, for sleeping! We’re gonna go sleep.


AUSTIN (as Hot Sailor, disappointed): Oh. 


KEITH (as Fero): You know what, you go down there, you hang out, maybe we’ll come down later.


AUSTIN (as Hot Sailor, flirtatiously): Alright, Boat Party. 


(ALI giggles)


KEITH (as Fero, imitating Sailor’s tone): Boat Party. 


AUSTIN: So they go - at this point, let’s make a perilous journey roll? 


JACK: Okay. What do these do?


AUSTIN: These are interesting. If you go to your - these probably aren’t on your Roll20 sheets, cause it’s a special move, they don’t come up very often. They’re on your special moves sheet. Perilous journey says - let me find it here (pages flipping) it’s not on this either - ah, here it is. 


JACK: It’s not on basic moves.


AUSTIN: Yeah, it’s on special moves, on the other side. (Reading from the book) “When you travel through hostile territory” which you are “choose one member of the party to act as trailblazer, one to scout ahead, and one to be quartermaster. The same character can not have two jobs.If you don’t have enough party members, or choose not to assign a job, treat that job as if it had rolled a 6. Each character with a job to do and rolls+Wis. On a 10 plus, the quartermaster reduces the number of rations required by one.  On a 10 plus, the trailblazer reduces the amount of time it takes to reach your destination - the GM will say by how much-  On a 10 plus, the scout will spot any trouble quick enough to let you get the drop on it. On a 7–9, each role performs their job as expected: the normal number of rations are consumed, the journey takes about as long as expected, no one gets the drop on you but you don’t get the drop on them either.” So - 


KEITH: I wanted to say, that I don’t have to consume any rations. 


AUSTIN: That’s good for you. But, the rest of this boat does, you know what I mean?


KEITH: Yeah yeah yeah.


AUSTIN: So that’s good for you, that you don’t have to, if someone fails, but not for them.


KEITH: Yeah that’s what I mean.


ALI: I have a telescope, so I should probably be our scout?


AUSTIN: Sound’s good.


JACK: Oh! Cool, what does the telescope do?


ALI: Gives me plus 1 on perilous journey rolls.


JACK: Oh great. 


ALI: Which is good, because I have negative 1 Wisdom.


AUSTIN: Okay, so that means you’ll just be rolling a flat 2d6.


KEITH: I have plus 2 wisdom.


AUSTIN: So which task are people taking up here?


JACK: I think - hmm


AUSTIN: And Jack, remember, you have that map, don’t you? So you also get plus one?


JACK: Yeah, so - I’ll be a trailblazer, if nobodies voting otherwise?


AUSTIN: That’s a weird - that’s like a weird thing to think through on a boat? Like that doesn’t exist?


JACK: Yeah, I was about to ask about that. 


AUSTIN: Like, the scout makes sense


KEITH: You gonna go up in the crow’s nest?


AUSTIN: I think that’s probably the scout - 


JACK: Scout


AUSTIN: or the - what’s the actual name, is it scout? It’s the quartermaster, the trailblazer… oh it is scout. So that’s the scout - oh, you know what you’re doing, Jack? I think the trailblazer in this case is, and this makes sense for you. Lem is reading the current maps, the maps of the currents 


JACK: Oh, cool.


AUSTIN: Looking out for storms, trying to plot the safest route through this harsh straight. Trying to make sure you catch the right currents and don’t get caught by any rogue waves or anything like that. Which I guess leaves Fero to be the quartermaster?


KEITH: Sure.


AUSTIN: Cooking up some meals for people, you don’t eat, but - 


KEITH (as Fero): I don’t eat, but I’m a great cook.


ALI (as Hella): Yeah, he’s supposed to be crowd control, anyway.


KEITH (as Fero): I’m a really good cook.


JACK: “I’m a really great cook, despite having not imbibed food for my entire life” 


(AUSTIN laughs)
        
        KEITH (as Fero): I have eaten, I just don’t need to, and I don’t like to


AUSTIN: That’s all.


KEITH (as Fero): Yeah. Sometimes the mood strikes me, and I’m like “I’m gonna have a sandwich! I haven’t had a sandwich in five years”


(ALI and JACK laugh)


AUSTIN: We can’t talk about food - Listen, we can not talk about food right now, I’m


KEITH: Like a delicious brown mustard - 


AUSTIN: I am so close to being out of food in my life right now.


(ALI, JACK and KEITH laugh)


KEITH: Oh, yeah, me too. Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Okay. So - how far do you think this is? We haven’t decided about the scale of this map, now that we have the final map. We talked about it being a couple US states big, or like the size of New York or something like that?


KEITH: And we’re going half way


AUSTIN: Right. That’s pretty far. Right?


KEITH: That’s super far


AUSTIN: But not impossibly far. Do you think this is like a week trip?


KEITH: This is like a week trip. Maybe - 


ALI: Do you think so?


KEITH: Maybe like 10 days.


AUSTIN: Let’s say - 


KEITH: Boats are slow. 


AUSTIN: Boats are slow. Let’s say 1 day per tile. How about that?


KEITH: Okay.


AUSTIN: Which I think is like one, two, three, four, fiveee? Let’s say seven. This is like about seven if you take some of these corners tight.


KEITH: Yeah.


ALI: Well, do we want to maybe just like, get off at the Chin and then walk down?


KEITH: That would only make it five right? That’s not a big deal - 


AUSTIN: That would make it only five. Yeah. 


KEITH: And then we would have to walk the rest of the way which - 


JACK: Besides, part of what interests me about - 


AUSTIN: Ahhh - you could - the thing is, walking might be faster if you could be on those main roads and also you don’t have to worry about being on the ocean anymore. Remember, your character doesn’t like the ocean.


        KEITH (as Fero): Yeah, I don’t like the ocean at all.


AUSTIN: So, it’s up to you guys. Either of these is fine by me, I have stuff, I have stuff. We’ll be fine.


KEITH: I’m saying yes, let’s get off at the Chin, I agree now.


JACK: Part of me, part of what I like about being on a boat - and I guess we get a lot of this, even if we get off at the Chin - is we get to see things on the shoreline as we travel. We get a sense of the world and what’s happening in it, or interesting things within the world, as we’re traveling.


AUSTIN: Right. 


KEITH: I feel like if the worst way to figure out what’s happening in the world is to be on a boat, cause then you’re not in the world.


(ALI laughs)


AUSTIN: Great.


(JACK laughs)


JACK: I’d be happy getting off at the chin, yeah.


ALI: We can hang towards the shore as we’re walking, though.


AUSTIN: Which shore? Ordenna’s or Hieron’s


ALI: No no no - Hireron’s. 


KEITH: Hieron’s 


AUSTIN: So you want to go this way? I’m drawing a - do you see this coming up on your map, guys? 


KEITH: No. 


AUSTIN: Are you guys on the wrong map?


KEITH: Nope. I’m seeing - 


ALI: Yeah - 


KEITH: Maybe you’re drawing underneath - 


AUSTIN: I think I might be drawing on -


JACK: I see it, I see it


KEITH: Oh I see now! I see now


AUSTIN: Let me get rid of the last one where I, like,  picked the nose, I didn’t mean to do that at all. Uh-oh


JACK: I thought it was half an arrow?


KEITH: It looks like half an arrow to me.


AUSTIN: Yup Yeah, okay, that’s what I meant, half an arrow. Now it’s a whole arrow, let me move that up higher.


(ALI laughs)


AUSTIN: Yup that’s an arrow. Okay, go ahead and make your rolls here.


KEITH: Alright.


AUSTIN: So that was…

KEITH: I‘ve got 11.


AUSTIN: so that means


KEITH: I’ve been rolling all 11s


AUSTIN: you’ve been rolling really well. No one’s failed yet, right?


ALI: No.


KEITH: No.


JACK: So 2d6 plus wisdom, 


AUSTIN: Also - 


JACK: plus my perilous journey roll, which is an extra -  


AUSTIN: plus 1. 


JACK: Plus 1.


AUSTIN: for a total of plus… whatever.


KEITH: 2, I think, for Lem.


AUSTIN: Oh, Ali’s just came through


ALI: I got a 7? Because it’s minus 1, then plus 1


AUSTIN: Oh why didn’t you do - It says minus 1 plus 0 here?


ALI: Yeah, cause I just clicked on the WIS button.


AUSTIN: Got it 


JACK (loudly): Oh god damnit.


AUSTIN: Oh, Jack.


KEITH: This is, gotta get those buttons, gotta get those macros. 


ALI: Just click the button under Wisdom?


AUSTIN: Oh, dear. Yeah, so Jack, did you know that? On Roll20, if you just go to your character sheet, you can click the button that’s under Wisdom.


JACK: But that doesn’t account for my perilous journey roll.


AUSTIN: No, we’d just add one. But 


JACK: Ahh I see (Jack clicks the button)


AUSTIN: Sadly, that was your second roll and not the first roll.


JACK: That was an 11.


(ALI laughs)


AUSTIN: Mark an XP. For failing your roll.


ALI: Should I do that too? 


AUSTIN: No, because your succeeded, you had that plus 1 that brought it up to 7, remember?


ALI: Oh. OH, OH he did real bad.


AUSTIN: He did real bad. 


(JACK laughs)


KEITH: Well, you say he did real bad, you did 1 better (laughing).


AUSTIN: Yeah but, listen that one is all the world, you know?


ALI: He rolled a 4 before his bonus.


AUSTIN: I know, but the difference between a 4 - the difference between a final mark of 6 and a final mark of 7 is substantial. So, everybody - this is one two three days away. For three days - I don’t know why I’m deciding this is where it happens, I guess because the nose is a really nice spot. So, the first full day goes by, and in the morning you’re passing of that first mark to the south of Velas. And you can see, on the coastline of Hieron, some of the smaller villages that dot the outskirts of Vellas, there are some farms and they look shitty. Fairly close to the coastline, this is sort of a coastal forest region. Not like deep forests, but there are some trees and there are some people you can see off in the distance tilling some grass, and they don’t look great. (Getting louder) Also, let’s say, you can see people on horses moving up and down the main road in the distance. Hella can see that with her spyglass. So, maybe a good idea to not have taken the main road. The second day goes by, fairly uneventfully, most people have kind of continued the party. Boat Party day two happens. 


KEITH: Boat Party!


AUSTIN: It’s hard not to get pulled down into it, but you guys are able to keep the boat under control. Day three, Jack, Lem, you know you read the maps right, you’re so sure you read the maps right. 


(JACK laughs, Ali makes a scared noise)


JACK: Oh god, this is so embarrassing for me. 


AUSTIN: But  (a pause), so when the wave hits, it is quite a shock. Give me - 


KEITH (as Fero): I knew it.


JACK (as Lem): What are you saying here, Fero? 


 KEITH (as Fero): I’m saying that there’s, I said waves, specifically, as a thing to watch out for.


AUSTIN: Give me 1d2. We’re basically flipping a coin here.


JACK: Okay. I’d like you all to know, I typed it out straight, and then went back and typed /roll.


AUSTIN: Good Job. Okay - okay, this doesn’t matter, this is just West or East, you got East. So, the waves start slamming against you, harder and harder, and you can see, off in the distance you see, Hella that Ordenna gets farther and farther away. And bit by bit, the boat begins to shift in direction toward the outcropping on the map here, off the side of the Hieron, toward the nose of this man, so to speak, this old man. 


[One Hour 30 Mins] 


AUSTIN: The boat is starting to get out of control, and it doesn’t help that everyone onboard is either drunk or hungover. They can’t really get control of it quickly enough. And worst of all, Hella - who’s doing her job well - sees off in the distance, over the - I’m going to zoom in on this map a little bit - I don’t know if this is gonna work for you guys? Does that zoom in for you or do you have to do this individually? You probably have to do this - in the top left, there’s that magnifying glass?


KEITH: Yeah


AUSTIN: Go ahead and click that, go up to 200, and look at the tip of this arrow.


JACK: Okay?


AUSTIN: Okay so, you guys are getting blown in this direction, toward the land - do you see that?


KEITH: Yeah.


JACK: Mm-hmm,  yeah.


AUSTIN: And then coming right this way, Hella, you notice another ship.


ALI: Oh?


KEITH (whispering): I fucking called it.


AUSTIN: It’s flying a red flag, with a bright golden crown. You recognize it as the lead ship in the small armada of Brandish, the Pirate King. 


KEITH (whispering): I fucking said, to go - 


AUSTIN: You might remember Brandish the Pirate King. But if you don’t, it’s been a couple of weeks at this point, let me read - 


ALI: My first love letter.


AUSTIN: From Hella’s first love letter.


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Do you remember what happened?


ALI: I defeated him, right?


AUSTIN: You did! You did! But then you didn’t take his head. 


ALI: No.


AUSTIN: You left his head and instead took a strange map, which pointed to a mysterious spot on your home island which we should return to, and you took this spyglass, so here - 


KEITH: When you’re saying “she didn’t take the head” are you saying “she didn’t cut off his head” or “she didn’t take the head with her after she cut it off”? 


ALI: That’s a really good question.


(OUTRO music begins to play)


AUSTIN: That’s a really good question. 


KEITH: Yeah.


JACK (as Lem): Hella?


KEITH: Okay. Undead pirates, fuck boats. 


(JACK laughs)


KEITH (as Fero, exasperated): I said no boats!

ALI (as Hella): It’s fine! It’s fine. Um…


JACK: I was so excited for my perilous journey with my map.


(KEITH, ALI and AUSTIN laugh)


AUSTIN: What’s worse is now you have a choice. You could pilot this ship into the craggy nose of this continent. Or, you could try and straighten it out and regain control, but that will put you right in the line with Brandish’s boat. Wow - we need a good name for this boat, what’s a good pirate boat name? 


(Loud typing)


JACK: The Kingdom Come. 


AUSTIN: Yup! The Kingdom Come. That’s a great name. 


(Jack’s clock dings loudly)


AUSTIN: @NotQuiteClock agrees. 


JACK: Naming pirate boats since - whenever it started naming.


AUSTIN: A few minutes ago.


JACK (as Lem): I think this should be up to Hella. 


KEITH (As Fero): I think this should be up to me. 


JACK (as Lem): Of course you do, Fero. 


AUSTIN: You always do. 


KEITH (As Fero): Because I said no boats and you did boats, we’re not crashing - we’re not going to intentionally crash our boat


AUSTIN (fading away with the music: I should paint a better picture, this was a good characterization opportunity I just realized I missed. One of the things I like about this is we can see Lem and Hella and Fero in different spots while this happens.
