SPRING IN HEIRON 13: THE TIME OF GODS

AUSTIN: Ephrim, it has been...I’d say an hour since you finished looking through Samot’s room, and you’ve all gone your separate ways, and as you’re walking across the courtyard of the Last University, you find yourself coming back to that tree. It’s gotten bigger today. You saw it at the beginning of the day and you’d had it cordoned off, but already the trunk of the tree is pushing out one of the corners of the-  of the cordonning that you set up. And it is now as tall as any of the civilian structures that have been built in the entire university. What do you do?


SYLVIA: So you said I could see the roots sort of popping out, kind of, of the trunk?


AUSTIN: So here’s the thing, you thought they were.


SYLVIA: Okay.


AUSTIN: But now as they pop out more you see that they’re like…maybe they were roots this morning. Now they look more like they’re branches.


SYLVIA: Can I, like ch—I want to check to see how far they go, if—just visibly at least.


AUSTIN: Yeah, so they—


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: So you begin to pull at them, right? And you see that like you pull it out of the ground, and you see it is literally just a branch now. Maybe—again, maybe this morning it was a root. But whatever’s happening with this tree, this has gone from being the bottom of the tree to being the middle of the tree. Or the top, I guess.


SYLVIA: I mean… [sighs] You set me up for this one. 


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): We’re gonna have to get to the bottom of this tree. We should start digging— 


AUSTIN: Eahh.


SYLVIA: We need to start digging around this, though. Like, genuinely. 


AUSTIN: Okay.


SYLVIA: That is—Ephrim’s plan is trying to get some people to just start working on digging this thing up, figuring out how far it’s spread, ‘cause it’s taking up a significant amount of our space that we need for people?


AUSTIN: Right, for farmland.


SYLVIA: Yes, exactly.


AUSTIN: To make, you know, food for all the people there are. You can, like, see it from- you can- you can see the very very top of it from inside the courtyard- or inside, like, the walls now. Like it is- it is getting big. So yeah, I like the image of like, we’re kind of opening on Ephrim seeing this stuff, then we cut to like people with shovels beginning to dig to try to reveal, like where’s—what’s up with this tree. And [sighs] I mean, I think it’s one of those things where—you’re not digging yourself, probably, right? You’re- you’re Lord Ephrim.


SYLVIA: Yeah, probably not—like, I think outside of originally, like pulling some of those branches up, once people get going, Ephrim’s kind of aside. He’s not going to help that much.


AUSTIN: Yeah. So, I think it’s just like digging, digging—there’s, you know, five or six people, it’s your retinue, or maybe just some laborers who work, you know, around and do odd jobs, maybe some guards, and revealing more and more of the roots to be revealed as actual branches—and not quite, like, they’re down six, seven feet, it’s getting- it’s getting, you know, it’s been a little while. And I think that’s when you—you watching it, you see, it grows. Like, you know, watching the grass grow is a phrase that is—that means like doing nothing because it’s impossible. This thing is growing at a rate that is visible. It’s like flexing. And it does it—it pulses, almost, once or twice. And then, there is a loud pop to the south, the sound of an explosion. And then you see the tree pulse again and grow even further. What do you do?


SYLVIA: I tell some of the...I think some of the guards and some of the more experienced laborers working on it, I tell them to go get some fire axes—or some wood axes. 


AUSTIN: Okay.


SYLVIA: I don’t know why I said fire axe. It’s the wrong thing.


AUSTIN: All right, so they’re going to run off to get axes. Do you send anybody to check out the explosion sound?


SYLVIA: Oh! Yeah, yeah. I think I send...I find Highwater? 


AUSTIN: Yep.


SYLVIA: Because she’s, like...she snuck up on me, so I know that like—like early on, that’s how we met, so I know, one, she’s good at stealth, so if there’s a problem she can get in and out, and, two, she’s fast.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


SYLVIA: So I’m gonna send her to go check it out and report back before I send a actual, like...detachment or something out there.


AUSTIN: Okay. She says,


AUSTIN (as Highwater): All right…I have a really bad feeling about everything right now. Call it Cobbin’s intuition, it—the tree, Samot’s supposed to be here soon, the Ordennans…Ephrim, are we ready for whatever this is?


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): I don’t think we have much of a choice here. So, yeah, we are.


AUSTIN (as Highwater): Okay.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): If you see Throndir on your way down there, [“Something” by Jack de Quidt begins to play] or before you leave, let—tell him about the tree? I feel like he might have seen something like this out scouting? Hopefully?


AUSTIN (as Highwater): Of course.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): [crosstalk] I don’t know.


AUSTIN (as Highwater): Of course. I’ll be back soon.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Thank you.


AUSTIN: And she scurries away to the south, where smoke is already rising.


[“Something” plays to end]


AUSTIN: Welcome to Friends at the Table, an actual play podcast focused on critical worldbuilding, smart characterisation, and fun interaction between good friends. I am your host, who is getting over a bad throat situation which you can still hear in my voice, Austin Walker, and today we are continuing our game of Dungeon World by Adam Koebel and Sage LaTorra. Joining me today, Sylvia[1] Clare.


SYLVIA: Hey, I’m Sylvia. You can find me on twitter @captaintrash, and you can listen to my other show Emojidrome on Google Play or iTunes.


AUSTIN: Janine Hawkins.


JANINE: Hey, you can find me @bleatingheart on twitter.


AUSTIN: Andrew Lee Swan.


DRE: Hey, you can find me on twitter @Swandre3000.


AUSTIN: And Art Martinez-Tebbel.


ART: Hey, you can find me on twitter @atebbel. You can listen to hopefully the continuing adventures of One Song Only @onesongpod, [Austin laughs quietly] and if you’re in LA come hear my new band, Bad Throat Situation—


AUSTIN: Great, good.


ART: We’re playing all the- the best clubs.


AUSTIN: All the best ones. You can follow the show at twitter.com/Friends_Table, as as always if you want to support the show and buy me cough medicine, you can do that at friendsatthetable.cash—much appreciated.


ART: And uh hey, don’t send us cough medicine.


AUSTIN: Don’t do that, please. That would be bad.


JANINE: You sure? I know some good recipes. I did research?


DRE: [doubtful] Mm...


AUSTIN: I’m good. I’m good on Adaire’s cough medicine, thank you very much.


JANINE: How much laudanum would you say you’re- you’re good with, normally?


AUSTIN: [laughs quietly] Just give me it, just— [Janine laughs] let’s go, let’s give—let’s try that shit out, let’s see what we can do.


JANINE: To be fair, that really thick horrible stuff you have to gargle does sound like some shit Adaire would come up with and sell.


AUSTIN: Oh, that’s totally—yeah, it is bad. It sucks.


JANINE: It’s thick ‘cause it’s working. 


AUSTIN: Uh huh.


JANINE: [laughing] That’s how you know.


AUSTIN: That’s what they say. 


[TIMESTAMP: 0:09:23]


AUSTIN: Throndir?


DRE: Yeah, hey.


AUSTIN: Blue J turns to look at you and does the wave, and then the explosion happens. And we are back here. You see the bridge collapse. You see Samot’s entire retinue fall below into the water and the rocks of the river. What do you do?


DRE: I mean, I dive into this river.


AUSTIN: All right, so you, like, run out there, because you’re— you were a little far away, remember? 


DRE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Blue J was out ahead of you.


DRE: Yeah, they ran out ahead, so…yeah, I think as soon as like, that stuff starts happening, Throndir just takes off in a dead sprint, and is already, like, you know, throwing off like heavy overcoat or whatever.


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah, getting ready to dive in. I think you get to the—you get there, and you see...oh yeah, I think you—let’s, let’s, let’s—you know what, let’s make a check on this. This is a defy danger dexterity. And I think Blue J just like, does not know what to do. They are like, very, like...they are frozen. They’re like a deer in headlights right now, right? Like, they’ve talked a big game, they want to be the Ranger, but they are not at “I’m going to immediately dive into the water to be a hero”, because there’s rocks down there, right? Like, it’s not all wa—like it’s, it’s hard to dive into a river [laughs] from atop a bridge- a broken bridge, when there was just an explosion. Also, I think that they’re scared. Like, an explosion just happened not far away from them. So give me a defy danger dexterity.


DRE: 12.


AUSTIN: That’s a 12, hell yeah. So…you know what, before we continue, talk to me about your alignment, talk to me about your- your bonds.


DRE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: And we’ll do this as we go around the table with new characters also.


DRE: So my alignment is good, “Put yourself at risk to help improve someone else’s life.” I guess not drowning in a river is probably a life improvement.


AUSTIN: Yeah, mmhmm, yeah.


DRE: My bonds: Ephrim—oh, this is one I didn’t resolve, but I tweaked it just to try and make it seem more actionable.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


DRE: “Ephrim never wavered during the worst years of the last university, so I’m happy to follow his lead.”


AUSTIN: Yeah, that’s good.


DRE: Fero: “I’m not sure Fero knows what it means to help someone besides himself.” That’s one I think I want to—again, not rewrite, but tweak—


AUSTIN: Sure.


DRE: —but Fero’s not here right now so I’m not as worried about it.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


DRE: I resolved my previous bond with Hadrian...which was basically—I forget exactly how I had it written, but it was basically like, “Hadrian giving Benjamin to Arrell was pretty messed up and I need to talk to him about that.” 


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


DRE: I did talk to Hadrian about that.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


DRE: And was not very happy with the way [laughing] that conversation went.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


DRE: So the new bond I’ve written is, “Hadrian once was a man who could not suffer an evil creature to live; I need to find a way to sharpen his resolve.”


AUSTIN: Cool! That’s good.


DRE: And then my last bond is with Adaire: “Adaire is a total wildcard to me; I need to find out if she is someone who is also interested in doing right by others.”


AUSTIN: Okay, that’s less actionable, but it is at least, like, a direction, so I like it.


DRE: [quietly] Yeah.


AUSTIN: All right. So you dive into the water. And you see that many people here did not survive this fall or have already been washed south, down the river. But because you succeeded, you do find...you do see a familiar body. And it is caught against a rock, and you are able to swim to the body of [slowly] the Boy King, the God of Books and Wine, the Knower of Things, The Boy Who Apologised, the being that once began life as a word eater, as a- as a fragment of shadow, the Good King Samot. And it becomes clear immediately that that was not a conventional explosive, because his body is pierced through and silhouetted by countless sharp black blades, striking deep into his body. Deep into parts of his body that have not been hit since he was a being of shadow, ancient parts. But you—do you—you grab him and...you got a 12, like you’re not doing damage to him, what you’re doing is preventing him from washing away south and needing to go on an expedition [Austin and Dre laugh] to try to find him; that’s a good success. And you pull him aside, and he’s covered also in what at first looks like black powder, but….you know, maybe you just—you’re not the ranger anymore, but like you understand what black powder is versus what...I mean, you’re the gunslinger now, so maybe you understand black powder more than ever. This is not just black powder, this is black powder mixed with, like, ground down Ordennan steel.


DRE: Okay.


AUSTIN: So it’s like flecks of fiberglass Ordennan steel.


DRE: Hey, um…is this fucking me up at all...since I’m a vampire.


AUSTIN: [quietly] Oh, fuck, you’re a vampire. [Dre laughs] Yo…


DRE: Not to, uh, not to let, you know.


AUSTIN: [despairing] No, that’s good. Thank you for this. [Dre continues laughing] Yeah, it is. I think you’re able- I- so. First, I guess—how—what’s that—how does it work when you hit the thing that you’re weak to? What’s the actual move say?


DRE: Let’s see….


AUSTIN: It’s like, you don’t get- you don’t get—you’re repulsed and vulnerable towa—to Ordennan steel.


DRE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] So I think it—


DRE: [crosstalk] I think it— yeah, it’s not like I can’t go near it, but…


AUSTIN: Well, repulsed means repulsed.


DRE: That’s true.


AUSTIN: So I think you’re gonna need another check here. Right? I think maybe…the check—the dexterity check is like, you’re able to swim, and I’m gonna say you’re able to like—you’re able to like, get—you are able to identify Samot and get him to a position to where he’s not, like, currently going down the river, but you’re repulsed by this. Is this a check to overcome the repulsion? Or do you think this is you can’t do it, when this thing says “you’re repulsed by”.


[TIMESTAMP: 0:15:16]


DRE: So…I’m also checking through my other stuff here.


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.


DRE: Because, there is that—there is another vampire move where you can spend vigor?


AUSTIN: Yeah.


DRE: To resist a weakness?


AUSTIN: Right.


DRE: And I forget…I guess I have to eat people, to get vigor.


AUSTIN: You do need to eat people to get vigor. [crosstalk] You don’t have it right now, right?


DRE: [crosstalk] So, instead of spending one vigor, I can gain one hunger.


AUSTIN: Okay.


DRE: Which lets you do fun things.


AUSTIN: That does let me do fun things.


DRE: And I’m… [sighs] And I guess, in order to do that, I would probably need to do this, instead of just doing like a- like a roll? I feel like just doing a roll kind of negates…


AUSTIN: Yeah, agreed.


DRE: ...that, mechanically speaking.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Yep. Yeah, I like the idea of you— 


DRE: [crosstalk] So yeah, I’ll just take—I’ll take a hunger.


AUSTIN: Yeah, so what’s that- what’s that visibly look like on the screen, so to speak.


DRE: [sighs] I think this is like, the first for real time Throndir has been around Ordennan steel again? So it’s—


AUSTIN: I mean, there’s been some around the base, but you’ve done a good job of, like—remember you identified that like, oh this is bad around—this is bad for people. But like…but yeah, I think- I think this is the first time you’ve been this close to such a concentrated dose, y’know?


DRE: Yeah. So I think…he’s had, like, an academic understanding that this is bad?


AUSTIN: Yeah.


DRE: And like, maybe, like other members of like, the Golden Lance are like, “Hey, this is—this is gonna go bad if you’re near this. This is how you’ll know, blah blah blah.”


AUSTIN: Yeah.


DRE: But it’s like…it’s like the—you know, there’s a difference between feeling it and actually doing it. 


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


DRE: So I think it is…I do think it doesn’t, like—it doesn’t stop Throndir? He still is like, very much just like grabbing it. But then it’s just a...very very nasty, awful…just like, pain going up his arm.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


DRE: Almost like a really, like—like an instant spread of, like, a bad, like, awful rash, or like, huge bug bite or something like that.


AUSTIN: Totally. All right, cool. Well, you...that is- that is—I, yeah, I think it is like visible, it’s like a rash, sure. What does overcoming it look like? Do you—is it- is it just like pushing through, it’s not…there’s no vampire element to it. The only element to it is the pain.


DRE: Yeah, I think at this point it is just pushing through.


AUSTIN: Yeah, okay. Aright. So then—


DRE: I think with other things it would be different, but this is just pushing through.


AUSTIN: So then you—you pull him to the near side of the…of the river, and I think at this point Blue J is able to come down and help you begin to move the body. And also, I think this is the moment where you like, look around, and you see really the depth of devastation. I think there’s a point at which we just get a shot of Blue J looking down at you as you’re dragging Samot up a- up the cliffside, and we get the shot over their shoulder, and they at first are looking at Samot’s body, but then they start looking at the things around you that you’ve been like—the rubble that you’ve been kicking away to clear the path—and then the camera kind of refocuses to show that the rubble is broken Pala-din. It’s just like, dozens of destroyed- of shattered statue people.


DRE: Are these Samot’s Pala-din?


AUSTIN: Yeah.


DRE: ‘Cause he was marching with Pala-din.


AUSTIN. Yeah. These are his—his Pala-din. For sure.


DRE: Are there any other, like—


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] There were— there were people there, too. A hundred percent.


DRE: [crosstalk] —people that look like they’re surviv—that have survived, or is everybody just…


AUSTIN: You know, I’m gonna say it’s what—you were one person, you were able to get down there and save Samot. Like…I think that’s who it is. And maybe some of Samot’s retinue that survived did wash downriver, and maybe they’ll be okay. But like, it is Samot that you managed to save, here.


DRE: Yeah…I guess I’m more just asking, like— when I dived in there weren’t other people like swimming, or yelling, it was…


AUSTIN: No, no, no, no.


DRE: Yeah. Finding other people would be work, here. Okay.


AUSTIN: Yeah, totally, totally. And- and- maybe you could come back and start, you know, checking the water later for- for people? Or further south, or at another passing or something? But like, right now, not so much. So yeah, I think Blue J helps you try to move this body, but like…it’s bad. It hurts you to do this. And also…like, his hair is filled with blood, and his body is covered by it, and by the black soot…This was like—this feels...precise. And I think you get the body back up to the road, and that’s when Hightower* shows up. I don’t know that we need to, like, stay super focused here. We don’t need the conversation between you and Hightower*, because you know what that conversation is. It’s like “Oh my god, what happened,” and then, it’s just like, more people coming to help you move the body back. And word travelling through camp, that, “Oh yeah, there was a big important person coming from the south...and he got hurt.” So let’s go back to camp really quick. Let’s go back to the settlement—to the University. Adaire and Hadrian, what are you two up to right now? I’d say it’s early evening, maybe. I don’t remember when we set the original thing last time. I don’t remember where we were. I remember we—we’d had a full day of stuff, right? ‘Cause we’d done the, like, look for—look through Samot’s stuff, and all that, so.


ART: Yeah, I’m gonna hundred percent level with you there, I do not remember where—


JANINE: Me neither.


ART: —we left off last time.


AUSTIN: That’s fine. The last things that I remember happening in the last session were...Adaire, you scared off the...the shitty Celador, the  Moonlighter’s Guild guy—


JANINE: [laughing] Oh, right.


AUSTIN —and disrupted the transport of goods to—by doing that, you disrupted the transport of goods to Velas from the Dark Son. Ephrim and Hadrian, like, looked through all of Samot’s stuff in his old bedroom. You, Adaire, also convinced Rix and Rowe to do…what were they making? What had we decided that was, like—‘cause it wasn’t just—


JANINE: Volunteer cop badges, I think—no. [Austin and Janine laugh] She wanted them to make, you know, garlands—busywork and stuff just so they wouldn’t get into trouble before big stuff happened.


AUSTIN: Right, right, right, busywork. And I think those were the big things...and then-  and then Throndir, you were down here with Blue J and all that stuff happened, yeah, okay.


DRE: Mmhmm. Yeah.


AUSTIN: So yeah, let’s say, like, by the time the body gets back it’s gonna be early evening, so like, late afternoon, early evening as all this happens. Just, where are you, Ephrim, Adaire, and Hadrian. I know— Ephrim, you’re at the tree. They’re—they’re gonna try to cut down this tree. They’re trying to cut down this tree. You know, it’s not—it’s not doing much. Adaire and Hadrian, how about you two?


[TIMESTAMP: 0:21:54]


ART: You know what? I’m- I’m just—just trying to like pick something very mundane.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


ART: And I want just like, Hadrian, like, sort of like circulating in the market, like, looking for...


AUSTIN: Okay.


ART: You know, grocery-adjacent… [Austin laughs momentarily] Like I know it’s not groceries because like the situation, but like…


AUSTIN: Yeah. Eh, you can—


ART: Homewares, you know? Like—


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.


ART: A new pot, I don’t know. [Dre laughs] 


AUSTIN: [chuckles] Great.


ART: What do people use?


AUSTIN: Pots, pans, you know.


ART: Pots, pans, maybe a big spoon, like a real big spoon?


AUSTIN: Yeah, we just get Hadrian looking at a big spoon. What I think then—the person who actually comes to you to, tell you this, is Rosana, because she is on her game like that. And she like puts her hand—


ART: I resent the implication that looking at a big spoon is not being on one’s game.


AUSTIN: [laughs] Dre in the chat says “real big spoon, Art’s other new band”.


ART: I’m starting a lot of bands, [Austin laughs] it’s really impressive considering I have like no talent in that area.


AUSTIN: Well that’s the thing, you make a hundred bands, one of them’s gonna be okay, right? You know, she like, puts her hand on your side, and like moves around to like—not hug you, but like one hand on your right side, and then she slips around to your left, and then like leans in to whisper to you, and she says,


AUSTIN (as Rosana): [hushed, urgent] Come to the central tower, there’s an emergency.


ART (as Hadrian): Um, oh, okay—okay, yeah!


ART: Hadrian drops his big spoon. And then like, takes a step away and then like, oh that was a dick move, and like goes back and picks the spoon back up and like hangs it back up on the little hook. [Austin laughs] And then like…


AUSTIN: Great. Good. Good. And then Adaire, I think you hear this through...or, where are you at, I guess.


JANINE: I think Adaire’s doing the opposite of the mundane hanging out doing normal stuff thing. I think she’s kind of like, not sulking, but I think she’s like in her feelings a little bit. So I think she shimmied up in that gap between the gaming hall and the archive trading house and got up on the roof.


AUSTIN: Okay. Well then, you—


JANINE: To like, sit.


AUSTIN: Yeah, so like I think you actually see the puffs of smoke to the south then, when the explosion happens. Or like the lingering smoke afterwards maybe, I think based on timing, you see the smoke afterwards like rising to the south. What do you do?


JANINE: Ahh that’s a good fucking question. She knows Samot’s coming from the—from that direction, right?


AUSTIN: South. Yeah, totally.


JANINE: Okay. I think she goes to like check things out, but also doesn’t, like—she’s not running.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm. So, yeah—


JANINE: She probably has a moment on the roof just like, “What the hell now?”


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: And then kind of like scoots down, and…


AUSTIN: So then yeah, I think we get you running into Hightower*, Throndir, Blue J, and maybe a couple of guards, who have Samot on a stretcher, about, you know, 500 yards south of the city. Throndir, you see Adaire approach.


DRE (as Throndir): Oh, gosh, I mean...I don’t—


JANINE (as Adaire): What the hell happened?


DRE (as Throndir): There was a bomb, there was an explosion...he’s really hurt. They used Ordennan steel.


AUSTIN (as Samot): [quiet moan of pain]


AUSTIN: He’s like, conscious, maybe? He’s like mumbling.


JANINE (as Adaire): Well, fuckin’, get him inside!


DRE (as Throndir): Yeah, I know—well, that’s what I’m doing, I had to carry him up from the river!


JANINE: Adaire gets out of the way, and like fuckin’ waves her hands, like, fuckin’ go!


DRE (as Throndir): Aren’t you like a doctor? Come with us! [Austin laughs softly]


JANINE (as Adaire): How do you still believe that? Just go. [Austin and Dre laugh]


AUSTIN: Wait, do you keep going south, Adaire? Or do you just let them go. Like, what are you doing? Are you gonna go check out where the explosion was and stuff?


JANINE: I think so- I think like, you know—


AUSTIN: Uh huh!


JANINE: Adaire has some like- she certainly has some beliefs about what her medicine...type things can do.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: Which is mostly like, sometimes you do need to sleep.


AUSTIN: Yep.


JANINE: And that’s good. 


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: I don’t think she has ever been of the—even in the moments where she’s like “I’m kind of helping people,”—


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: I don’t think she’s ever been like, “oh I can help this god who’s been deeply injured with Ordennan steel, that’s my—”


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] No. No, no.


JANINE: “I can get—we’re in this fuckin’ wizard school, [Austin laughs] let me roll up my sleeves and get in there.” No, I think she’s gonna go like scope out the damage.


AUSTIN: Okay, so, you head south, and come to the damage, and, you know, it’s getting to be darker now, but you have a lantern or something, right. And you can see that—part of you, part of the thief, is like, aha there’s some stuff here maybe that I could take, that’s like worth money. That’s like was—you know, fell more on the rocks than on the river, you know? And so, you know, you see a—there’s a golden sheath that has fallen out of a long wooden box, which is like clearly a gift- like a wooden gift box of some sort. There are some wet papers, parchment, that you recover. There is...300 coin? Write that down. And...I think you see...yeah, I think this just happens. I think that there’s, like as you’re finishing up, you see someone in Ordennan clothes up on the—you know, the black and gold colors of Ordennan clothing, up on a nearby hill looking down at you. And they call out and they say,


AUSTIN (as Ordennan): The vulture’s already picking through the carcass.


JANINE: I think—no, I think that laugh—I think Adaire just straight up laughs.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: It is funny—one, ‘cause you assumed that was what she was going to do, and just like rolled very smoothly into “here’s all the stuff she can pick up”.


AUSTIN: Eh. If you don’t want to pick it up, you don’t have to, for sure.


JANINE: No, she’s going to. 


AUSTIN: Okay! [Dre laughs]


JANINE: But. [laughs] But like you definitely assumed.


AUSTIN: I did.


JANINE: I think she just laughs at this Ordennan, is like...man, what’s a good fuckin’ snappy comeback. She needs a good comeback here. I think she says something like...something like, 


JANINE (as Adaire): Well, at least I’m not here to pick up the corpses.


AUSTIN (as Ordennan): There are worse fates.


AUSTIN: They do like a little bow. They have—they could be Hella’s little cousin. They’re like, red hair like Hella, dark skin like Hella- brown skin like Hella. Very pretty, very fine features, but resolved. Square chin, and dressed more like...a courtier than, you know, a soldier. And they say,


AUSTIN (as Ordennan): My name is Carlay. Carlay de la Carta. I work with Fela Malle. And...we know you are of some prominence in your settlement. We come to tell you that the time of gods is over. It is the time of mankind. We will make a continent of iron, and we invite all civilized people of Hieron to join us. People like you will do well in the future. Just a consideration.


JANINE (as Adaire): If you’re calling me civilized, [laughing slightly] then you clearly don’t know shit about me. [someone laughs distantly]


AUSTIN (as Carlay): You will be civilized, in the new world. People like us—


JANINE (as Adaire): [sarcastic] That’s a very inviting statement, thank you. [Austin laughs lightly]


AUSTIN (as Carlay): I don’t mean that we will civilize you. I mean that people like us will define what civilized is.


JANINE (as Adaire): You ever heard the saying, “I don’t want to join any club that would have me as a member?”


AUSTIN (as Carlay): I can’t say I have.


JANINE (as Adaire): You should acquaint yourself with it.


AUSTIN (as Carlay): I will do that, Ms. Ducarte. Please, tell your friends that when they see our ships they need not fear them. We are not coming for you yet.


JANINE (as Adaire): [sarcastic] An explosion’s a great way to convey that.


AUSTIN (as Carlay): Sometimes you need to destroy walls.


AUSTIN: I think as they say that, there is the sound of like, a ship air horn? Like a foghorn? As the night descends, and they go,


AUSTIN (as Carlay): That’s for me. Be seeing you.


AUSTIN: And they just kind of like, hop back up in a very...like, I’m just going to be straight up. Like, anime ninja-ass way, [Janine laughs] you know, little quick lines of like dark movement, as this assassin retreats back into the dark.


JANINE: I think Adaire like looks back down at the stuff she’s gathering up, maybe like puts that gold scabbard in her teeth to hold it to free up a hand specifically, [Austin laughs] and flips them off, and then keeps working.


AUSTIN: Great, good. [Dre laughs]


[TIMESTAMP: 0:31:46]


AUSTIN: Ephrim? I think Ephrim, Hadrian, Throndir...actually, let’s just go with Ephrim and Hadrian first. Rosana is already like—Rosana is bringing it together. So it’s like, the two of you, Corsica Neue, Stornras Glasseye, Uklan Tel, who else—who am I forgetting who’s important who’s still around. Capital I important, like important to the infrastructure of this place.


DRE: Are Solomon or Lake around?


AUSTIN: I don’t think so.


DRE: Okay.


AUSTIN: I think they’re off doing some scouting to the east, actually, right now...I’m trying to see if there’s anyone else on the leadership side who should be here. I think Chatterchin from the gnolls.


DRE: Mmm.


AUSTIN: I’m looking at the list of people who lived through winter. One second…


DRE: Did you say Red Jack?


AUSTIN: I did not say Red Jack. Red Jack is there, sure. Good call, good call, good call. Rosette? Is Rosette? Rosette, also, from the moths.


DRE: Mmm.


AUSTIN: And you’re all in like that big central meeting place. Where did you put Samot, Throndir, when you arrived?


DRE: God, do we have like a set place that’s like a...


AUSTIN: An infirmary?


DRE: ...hospital or an infirmary?


AUSTIN: You have to. After the fuckin winter?


DRE: Yeah. Yeah, totally.


AUSTIN: Probably somewhere in the meeting hall, right?


DRE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Or the central tower, maybe, the base of the central tower. So yeah, is it just—do you clear out some space in the infirmary for him? Alright. But yeah, so, otherwise, all the rest of you have been called together. Ephrim, I think Hightower* runs over to tell you as soon as she’s back in camp. Runs right to you, right to the tree, and she’s the one who is like,


AUSTIN (as Hightower): [worried] Oh my god, Lord Ephrim. Samot’s been wounded badly.


AUSTIN: And that’s when one of Rosana’s messengers comes to grab you, and says like, hey, uh oh, you know. And yeah, you’re all in the central tower. You have a god who is dying in your infirmary, what do you do?


ART: I would like to start by...designating Samot my ward.


AUSTIN: Sure. What’s that do? What’s that mean?


ART: I mean, nothing right now. There’s things I can do when defending—


AUSTIN: Okay.


ART: —my ward, but I don’t know that...I don’t know, that’s relevant? But if it happens…


AUSTIN: Sure.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Also, Hadrian, let’s go over your beliefs and bonds, and then Adaire we should do that with you, and then Ephrim also.


ART: By beliefs do you mean alignment?


AUSTIN: I meant alignment, yeah, sorry.


ART: My alignment is “Suffer or endure a hardship so that someone else does not have to.” My bonds, starting with people who are here. “Throndir has been through hard times and come out on the other side. He is a valued friend.” and “Adaire has a silver tongue, but metals are only sacred if they’re blessed.” Fero is “Fun is fun, but Fero would let my family die. Never trust him.” And “I trust Hella to carry me through troubled times. I don’t trust her sense of direction.”


AUSTIN: Mmm.


ART: I can probably resolve that one as soon as I hang out with Hella again.


AUSTIN: Yeah, probably. I’d say also start looking to see if you can resolve the Throndir and Adaire ones, so that we can get that XP going.


ART: Yeah, uh huh.


AUSTIN: Adaire? Let’s do you since we—I forgot to last sequence, I’m sorry about that.


JANINE: Yeah. My alignment is chaotic.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: “Break an unjust law to benefit another.”


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: My bonds are, for Hadrian, “Hadrian is not an unmovable rock; do not use him as a foothold.” [Austin laughs lightly] Lem, “Lem is a river in need of a damn; give him shape and guidance.” Hella, “Hella’s loyalty is a tremendous and unreliable asset; cultivate it actively.” 


AUSTIN: If you feel like you develop a new bond during this game, go ahead and write that down, too.


JANINE: Okay.


AUSTIN: ‘Cause everyone can have up to four. 


JANINE: Oh, okay.


AUSTIN: And Ephrim. Yeah.


SYLVIA: Alright. My alignment is neutral. “Increase the prestige of yourself or your stronghold.”


AUSTIN: Sure.


SYLVIA: My bonds are, with Hadrian I have “I owe Hadrian and his family for bringing his son back to this dying world.” Throndir, “Throndir helped me get where I am today, and I owe him for it.” Fero’s is “Fero is always welcome but never expected.” And I have a fourth slot that I also have to fill at some point.


AUSTIN: Okay, cool. So I think everyone looks to you and Corsica Neue, probably, Ephrim. And I’m curious who speaks first.


SYLVIA: Uhh…


AUSTIN: I think Corsica does.


SYLVIA: I think Corsica does too. 


AUSTIN: Yeah.


SYLVIA: Ephrim’s kinda like...like, the second he heard the news, all the blood drained out of his face, and it is yet to return.


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah. Corsica says,


AUSTIN (as Corsica): If this is an attack, we need to prepare. It would be strange to hit a potential ally of ours unless it was to gain some benefit, a foothold on which to drive a stake into us. At the same time, for them to attack to the south...it could be a feint. Regardless, ready the guard. Wake the reserves. We are on full alert. Send scouts to the Ordennans. We should have found out what they were up to immediately.


SYLVIA: We still have—they’re still in Samot, all the shards of the thing that exploded, right, we don’t have any...


AUSTIN: Oh yeah.


SYLVIA: ...don’t have any ones that are separated at all?


AUSTIN: No, I don’t think- I don’t think—


SYLVIA: ‘Cause I’d want to show that to like people in charge of these guard units, to be like there are things out there that—like this, that could fall.


AUSTIN: Mmm, yeah, you know what, I’ll say then yeah, sure, one of them fell out when you were putting him into the infirmary, or they removed one for you to show. How are you holding it? It’s in your one hand, your like gloved hand?


SYLVIA: Yeah, I think it’s—yeah. 


AUSTIN: Okay.


SYLVIA: I think it’s like very delicately, like if you ever had to like pick up a big piece of glass.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


SYLVIA: Kind of like that.


AUSTIN: Totally. Yeah. Yeah, I think there’s probably some other like, you know, captain of the left guard, captain of the right guard, in here too, you know.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: They’re like, “yes, of course”, whatever.


SYLVIA: And then I think Ephrim’s gonna be like,


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Well, that leads us to what—what we need to do now, we need to make sure he’s stabilized, we need to get these things out of him. But we need to make sure we don’t kill him in the process. 


SYLVIA: And I think he looks to Uklan Tel? ‘Cause...or like anybody who spends a lot of time in the library area of the…


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah. Oh! Sunder is probably here, too.


SYLVIA: Okay, yeah.


AUSTIN: That makes—yeah yeah yeah. So I think the two of them are like...I think Sunder is like,


AUSTIN (as Sunder): We need time...Samot isn’t like us. And anything we do could be- could be dangerous.


AUSTIN: And Uklan Tel is like,


AUSTIN (as Uklan): I have some ideas! I’ve been working on things, for years! I have some ideas.


AUSTIN: And is like, a little trigger happy.


DRE (as Throndir): Okay…


AUSTIN: And Sunder’s like,


AUSTIN (as Sunder): We should really spend time doing an initial evaluation and see where he’s at, before we attempt any sort of...any sort of reparative magic or anything else.


DRE (as Throndir): Sure, but what are the ideas?


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Well, I have to see the wounds, but I’ve been working on a sort of...I’ll have to...I can explain it to you! If you come to my lab, later.


DRE (as Throndir): Okay.


AUSTIN: Vibes...is a thing I’ll...you’ve never seen Uklan Tel quite like this. There is like a degree of excitement in his voice? It’s a little creepy.


DRE: Yeah. 


SYLVIA: Mmhmm.


AUSTIN: You know, a decade ago, someone convinced him to get really deep into fieldwork and studying the Heat and the Dark, and he’s been doing that since then.


ART: I think...I think I should be really involved in this, I have a lot of experience as a combat medic, and probably more experience with the divine than most people here.


AUSTIN: Eh. [Austin and Dre laugh quietly]


AUSTIN: I think Rosana says,


AUSTIN (as Rosana): You should attend to him. Though you may not be...of the cloth in the way you were once, you certainly still know the medical arts well enough, and you’re right, you have a closeness with Samot.


ART: Interestingly, I still have the move that gives me plus to healing—


AUSTIN: Yep.


ART: —I don’t have a move that heals.


AUSTIN: I think that’s just—that would be a defy danger, is what we would do. The danger is hurting him more. I think Red Jack—what’s Red Jack and the others...I think there’s actually—I think Chatterchin says like,


AUSTIN (as Chatterchin):[nervous] If there’s an attack coming...the last one was bad. When the Ordennans attacked a few years ago, we lost people. This has been great, but...maybe we should go. Gods, ehh…


AUSTIN: And Rosette, the leader of the mothkin, kind of echoes that sentiment, and is like...again speaking the way she does which is through voices, human voices she’s heard that she reproduces by like, kind of rubbing her antennae together, basically says,


AUSTIN (as Rosette): My people have been through a lot. And we are brave and willing to fight, but we know this will be a war we lose if there is such a one.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Are you proposing we abandon this, are you asking to leave? I’m...I won’t s—


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): They are looking for leadership, I suspect.


AUSTIN: Says Red Jack.


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Encouragement?


DRE (as Throndir): Rosana, we stood with you together and fought, and—


AUSTIN: Or, Rosette. Rosette.


DRE: Rosette, sorry.


AUSTIN: That’s fine.


DRE: Too many R-O- names.


AUSTIN: I know, I know. [Dre laughs]


JANINE: It’s weird how Hadrian married a moth lady. [laughs]


DRE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: [laughs] Their love is beautiful and I will defend it.


DRE: Mmhmm. My true ship.


AUSTIN: [laughs lightly] I think she says like,


AUSTIN (as Rosette): And we were grateful for that. And we trusted this group’s leadership for a decade. But...we wonder now if it will be put to torch by the Ordennans, just as they tried to put our old home to torch.


DRE (as Throndir): I mean, if they’re on the move again, and they are marching, and they are looking to fight and destroy? It’s a matter of when not if, if you have to fight them.


AUSTIN: Corsica’s like,


AUSTIN (as Corsica): He’s right. And your chances are better with us than out there alone.


AUSTIN: Are there any other big concerns here...I think Red Jack is like...Red Jack’s old. Red Jack’s seen a lot. And Red Jack I think is the one who says like,


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): There is something else going on here. I have seen my fair share of war. If they wanted to cut off our heads, they would have targeted one of them. Ephrim or Corsica. But they did not do that. I am not saying we should not prepare ourselves. But there is a degree of arrogance in presuming that we are the true target of that empire. We do not even have a name. We live in ruins. We convince ourselves otherwise to get through the night. But this is hardly a home yet.


ART: I think I speak for everyone in Gooseville when I say, rude. [Austin and Dre laugh]


AUSTIN: I think he says like,


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Ephrim, Corsica, everyone. If we are going to find our way through this, by the end of it, we must know who we are.


AUSTIN: And he takes like a big swig from his like tankard, and he stands up, and he says,


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): I am going to go find my child and wash the blood from their hands, and tell them it will be okay. I trust you all to do the same to those you care for.


AUSTIN: And leaves.


ART: Ohh...


DRE (as Throndir): So this is basically like, what every day was like during winter. [Austin laughs] 


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Yeah...


DRE (as Throndir): Just so you know, Hadrian. We didn’t get a dead god every day, but...Ephrim and I basically struggling to make it work, and at the end of the day, Red Jack saying something [pithy or pissy, unclear 45:51] that makes you just feel pretty shitty.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


ART (as Hadrian): Yeah, great. Let’s get some people together, let’s get some horses, let’s ride down the Ordennans and get ourselves some blood to wash off our hands. [muffled laughter from several people]


DRE (as Throndir): Yeah?


ART (as Hadrian): No?


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Alright, we have a god in critical condition here. I’m sorry gentlemen, we need to focus a little.


ART: Can I...discern realities isn’t right.


AUSTIN: What are you looking to do?


ART: I want to know more about what’s happening. I want to look at this with...I want Hadrian to look at this. I don’t want to hear what other people—like, I want…


AUSTIN: You want to like work through it in your mind, is what you’re saying.


ART: [crosstalk] Yeah, I wanna—


JANINE: [crosstalk] You’re gonna go to your mind palace.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: Your mind temple. [Dre laughs]


AUSTIN: Uh huh!


ART: I want to mind palace Samot right now.


AUSTIN: Oh, so you want to like go look at literally Samot.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Okay, then, then yeah, leave the room. So you get up and leave? Okay. So let’s come back to you in a second, I want to make sure there’s no other business in this room before we close the room scene. I think Rosana—Rosana squeezes your shoulders and gives you a kiss as you’re leaving but she’s staying here in this room.


DRE: I know Throndir wants to follow up with Chatterchin—


AUSTIN: Yeah.


DRE: —and Rosette later, but we don’t have to do that right now.


AUSTIN: Okay.


SYLVIA: I also want to track down Uklan Tel at some point—


AUSTIN: Okay.


SYLVIA: —and get to the bottom of his ideas—


AUSTIN: Yep.


SYLVIA: —but that’s also not urgent, so we can do this first.


AUSTIN: Okay. Sounds good.


ART: No one else is like worried about Uklan Tel like, doing something?


DRE: [crosstalk] Oh, I wanted to check up with him later, but...


SYLVIA: [crosstalk] That’s exactly why I’m— [Janine laughs] 


AUSTIN: Yeah, fair.


SYLVIA: Yeah, no, trust me, I’m very worried about that one.


ART: Okay. Just so we’re like, Uklan Tel starts some shit is on everyone’s radar, I’m just...I don’t want to be in—I don’t want my finger in every pie, I just want to make sure everyone knows all the pies are here, you know?


DRE: Oh yeah, listen, I want to hear ideas, because I can’t stop him if I don’t know what his ideas are. [laughs]


AUSTIN: Right. No, I get you.


[TIMESTAMP: 0:47:51]


AUSTIN: Okay. Let’s stay with you...here’s a cute—a quick cut in, is Adaire on your way back, you know, teeth with a—a sheath in your teeth, and arms filled with goods, you run into Rix and Rowe, who were coming to loot the river explosion. And Rix is like,


AUSTIN (as Rix): Aw...jeez. Do you want us to help you carry any of that, Adaire?


JANINE: Mmm...I think Adaire like gives them a real stern-ass look. [laughs]


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: And like puts the sheath, like tucks it under her arm so her mouth is free again. [Dre laughs]


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE (as Adaire): [sighs] Look, I don’t wanna be crass here, but like...just so we’re clear, you were gonna go root through the pockets of drowned people, right?


AUSTIN (as Rix): Uh huh!


JANINE (as Adaire): That was the- that was the like A plan.


AUSTIN: They look at each other, and they’re like,


AUSTIN (as Rix and/or Rowe): Y- yeah?


JANINE (as Adaire): You know what happens to people when they drown?


AUSTIN (as Rowe): They get all like blehhhh.


AUSTIN: Says Rowe, and he like, makes like bulbous motions with his arms, he’s like, brrr, [Dre laughs] and Rix says like,


AUSTIN (as Rix): And they get like blue, and like their tongue falls out, it’s really gross.


JANINE (as Adaire): Yeah, why… [sighs] that’s not a good evening plan. Like it’s… [sighs]


AUSTIN (as Rix): You have a hard night’s work so in the morning you can get bacon.


JANINE (as Adaire): I—trust me, I get it.


JANINE: I think Adaire like, hands them the sack of wet parchment.


AUSTIN: [laughs] Good, okay.


JANINE: ‘Cause it is the least [laughs] interesting—


AUSTIN: Uh huh.


JANINE: —or openly valuable thing. And then like, you know, makes sure that they’re walking back with her.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: I’m really wrestling with whether or not I want her to like, be quiet now or say shit.


AUSTIN: What is your draw either direction, is what I’ll ask.


JANINE: What?


AUSTIN: What is the main draw in either—what are the pros or cons of each, for you, in figuring out what’s up with her?


JANINE: [sighs] I mean...the big thing is that like, I don’t think we have been transparent enough with her feelings about these kids, and that’s been very frustrating.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] No, so I’m curious. What are her feelings? What are her feelings with these kids?


JANINE: [sighs] It’s tough, because scared straight is a joke.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: But at the same time, like, when you actually identify parts of yourself in someone, and you know what happened to you…


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: And you don’t want that to happen to someone else, like what else is there for you to do? Like, I think that’s the dilemma she is in as a character and that I am in as a player, of just like, how much do you just kinda let it ride, and how much should you try to like get involved—


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: —at the risk of being super uncool?


AUSTIN: [laughs slightly] Yeah.


JANINE: Maybe it’s a mix of both. Maybe it is like, there is a portion of that walk that is quiet on Adaire’s end, I don’t know if Rix and Rowe are chatting.


AUSTIN: I think Rix is like immediately trying to look through these pamphlets—or this parchment, this wet parchment.


JANINE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: And figure out what it is, and what’s valuable and what’s not.


JANINE: I think Adaire kind of lets her do that. But she’s also like watching out of the corner of her eye to make sure she doesn’t like damage it—


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: —because wet parchment can… [Austin laughs] Parchment’s the one that I think is like animal skin, so it’s not that bad...


AUSTIN: I think so, I think it’ll be fine.


JANINE: But paper would be bad.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: I think like, out of nowhere, as Rix is doing this...I’m trying to think of something kind of fucked up to say, honestly. I think she says to Rix,


JANINE (as Adaire): When I was your age, I broke someone’s hand with a hammer.


AUSTIN: And I think she says,


AUSTIN (as Rix): What happened, why? Did they deserve it?


JANINE (as Adaire): No more than I would have.


AUSTIN (as Rix): That’s the way it goes! What’d you get paid?


JANINE (as Adaire): Not as much as it was worth, in hindsight.


AUSTIN (as Rix): Mmm. Well, I haven’t had to break anyone’s hand with a hammer yet, so. One day, maybe, but.


JANINE (as Adaire): Would you break Rowe’s hand?


AUSTIN (as Rix): Would I—no! Never!


JANINE (as Adaire): No matter how much you were paid.


AUSTIN (as Rix): How much does it cost to fix a hand?


AUSTIN: That’s—actually, Rowe asks that. Rowe goes,


AUSTIN (as Rowe): Well, how much does it cost to fix a hand? [distant laughter]


JANINE (as Adaire): Honestly, it depends. To fix it well, it costs a lot, and even then, it’s still not gonna work the same.


AUSTIN (as Rowe): A lot times two!


JANINE (as Adaire): Uh huh.


AUSTIN (as Rowe): That’s how much.


AUSTIN: He doesn’t know times tables, that’s wrong. He goes,


AUSTIN (as Rowe): Then twice as much as a lot!


AUSTIN: And Rix says,


AUSTIN (as Rix): No. I—no. And Rowe, you better not ever break my hand either.
AUSTIN: And he goes like,


AUSTIN (as Rowe): [resigned] Okay…


AUSTIN: And Rix says,


AUSTIN (as Rix): It’s not like we don’t have rules, Adaire. We take care of each other. We do what we have to, but we take care of each other.


JANINE (as Adaire): Yeah, and I’m saying it’s not like rules don’t have price tags. But everyone’s price tags are different.


AUSTIN (as Rix): The difference between me and everybody else in the world is: I see the price tags. They pretend they don’t exist.


JANINE (as Adaire): You’re only in your own head, you’re not in everyone else’s.


AUSTIN (as Rix): Yeah, I’m in their pockets. While they’re in their heads. I’m not so young.


JANINE (as Adaire): I’m just saying...keep those rules...keep your lines, you know?


AUSTIN (as Rix): Yeah. 


JANINE (as Adaire): Have lines, and...I can’t say like never cross them. Because sometimes you’re hungry, and you don’t really have a choice. But, really...be real generous with that price tag.


AUSTIN (as Rix): I will. Thank you. Speaking of price tags, I think these are like trade treaties. There’s all sorts of stuff here about exchanging money for shipments, and...I don’t know, there’s lots of pluses on this.


JANINE (as Adaire): Well, that’s...frankly meaningless to me, [Austin laughs] but I’m sure to someone else it’ll mean something.


AUSTIN (as Rix): Alright. I’m gonna stop reading it, ‘cause it’s bad for your eyes to read at night. That’s what I heard.


JANINE (as Adaire): That sounds true. [Austin laughs slightly]


[TIMESTAMP: 0:55:00]


AUSTIN: And I think the camera pans back up to like show the University in the distance, and we cut from that to the operating room. Hadrian, what’s Doctor Hadrian look like?


ART: Great question.


AUSTIN: Uh huh.


ART: It’s probably...probably a lot like…’cause, I mean, he hasn’t had time to change or anything, I think he’s just in his whatever like, “chillin’ in the market” clothes.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


ART: Yeah, so I think it’s more of like a demeanor change, it’s more of like a softening through the shoulders, and like a...


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


ART: You know...a relaxing of the eyes, you know, a less intense Hadrian.


AUSTIN: It’s you with some other people around. So like, the reason I’m letting you take the lead is that specific move, which was—what is it, is it hospitalier?


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Which says, “When you heal an ally, you heal +1d8 damage.”


ART: Right.


AUSTIN: Here’s a question. Does anything with this—with Samot being your ward change anything, or is it only with defense, the word defend, only with using defense?


ART: It’s only really with the word defend.


AUSTIN: Okay.


ART: When defending, I can give my ward an opportunity to escape a dangerous situation, but that’s not really what we’re talking about here.


AUSTIN: No. Sadly not.


ART: Yeah, I can call people out on their villainous actions. That’s not really happening here.


AUSTIN: No, not so much.


ART: And I could make myself burn with righteous anger, but that’s not really helpful here either. [Austin laughs] No one’s like, “I really want my doctor to by hyped up and angry”.


AUSTIN: No! Like never, never ever.


ART: Ever! I’m never—never looking for anger when the doctor comes around.


AUSTIN: So, again the reason—the thing that I like here is like, you don’t have a custom move for like, “I’m just healing”, but the hospitalier move I think does work here. Obviously it was originally for the pala-din, or the paladin thing, but here, like, you do know how to do some surgery shit, like that was probably part of your training as a paladin. Because, there’s laying on hands, and there’s times when it’s like, no like, you need some stitches, you know? But I think that’s probably a defy danger, and unfortunately for you I think it’s a defy danger intelligence roll. I think surgery is—it’s dex or it’s intelligence? And you got a +0 in both.


ART: Yeah, they’re both 0, my dexterity is nominally higher.


AUSTIN: Yeah, it’s a 12 instead of a 9. But they’re both +0 on the roll.


ART: Man, they’re really selfish with the modifiers here, huh?


AUSTIN: Yeah, it’s 13, you gotta get up to that 13.


ART: Alright. I guess I just gotta—I gotta roll it. I mean, I get the +1d8 no matter what.


AUSTIN: Yeah. So I think that’s only to like, healing. What I’ll—here’s what I’ll do, is I’m gonna convert that hospitalier which is supposed to heal damage, which is not really what you’re doing here. Healing a god is not like—this surgery is not, “and then Samot stands back up”, right? This surgery is like, I’m removing...I guess that’s my question is like—oh wait, you wanted to study him first, right? Let’s start there.


ART: Yeah, I wanted to get a- get a feel for it.


AUSTIN: So let’s—yeah. Before we do any rolls, let’s go ahead and give me then discern realities, because you wanted to study him, that was what you said.


ART: Did that work? Is it—I have it on a pop-out window, did it go twice?


AUSTIN: Oh, you hit it in fact...Art, you hit it three times.


ART: Well, we should take the first one, which was a 4.


AUSTIN: You don’t want to take the second one, which was a 6?


ART: Uh, no, I mean the third one is where I really [laughs] got together on an 8. I love that it went up in even numbers.


AUSTIN: Me too. [laughs slightly]


ART: I guess I thought I had to double click it, and you have to single click it, and I tried twice…


AUSTIN: Uh huh.


ART: I don’t know where the fourth one went.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] We’ll get it later, maybe it’ll just pop back up.


ART: [crosstalk] Maybe it was like a sanity check and roll20 was like, “there’s no way he needed to roll discern realities four times in...five seconds”.


AUSTIN: [laughs] And they’re like, yeah, stop this guy. So…[worried, foreboding tone] Hoo boy. Hadrian...


ART: So I can’t discern any answers here, so I think I’m just gonna go for it.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] No. Wait wait wait, no, I mean, you failed.


ART: [crosstalk] I mean, you can make a move as hard as you want.


AUSTIN: I can make a move as hard as I want. You know that scene in Definite Possible Murder, where Jason is like, “I thought you had to push the things through to get them out.”


ART: Mmm.


AUSTIN: That’s what happens, you gotta push the blade through Samot further. No, that’s not what you think. What I do think is, you—your read on this is that you need to charge ahead, you need to move quickly. 


ART: Mmm. Great.


AUSTIN: Because…’cause I’ll like give you some stuff that’s true, which is: this is deep in, and it is exactly the stuff that, like—it is not just anti-magic, it is condensed Heat and Dark, and that’s already bad against people, but against someone who is a supernatural being...really bad.


ART: Real bad. I’m with you on that.


AUSTIN: You have no idea what it means that Samot was once made of the Heat and the Dark, directly, was like directly that before Samol gave him a more permanent like Hieron, Hieronic body?


ART: Sure.


AUSTIN: But, you know it ain’t good!


ART: I mean, I’m made of bones, but if you threw a bunch of bone shards through my body, it would probably be pretty bad.


AUSTIN: That’d be bad. Right. And if you—


ART: Doesn’t matter that there’s bone already in there.


AUSTIN: Right, totally. But this is almost like, what if you...god, it’s like, it doesn’t even make any sense. It doesn’t make—‘cause it’s magic. It’s magic, right, like—it’s...


ART: Yeah. Hate magic.


AUSTIN: Really the closest thing I can think of is like, it is like if you used some sort of atomic—if you were hit with like atomic—like uranium knives.


ART: Atomic bones, yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah, atomic bones, exactly. It’s bad in there. Like, whatever...if you were hit by whatever the fuckin’ lightning strike hit the primordial ooze that life first began with, that probably wouldn’t be good! So—


ART: No! Any lightning, honestly.


AUSTIN: Yeah. So, what I’m gonna do is, I’m gonna actually give you a -1 to your next roll?


ART: Great. Uh huh.


AUSTIN: But also you’re gonna get a +1 because of your hospitalier, so they’re gonna cancel out.


ART: Uh huh.


AUSTIN: But the thing is, you do think you have to move as quickly as possible. That is what that -1 is for.


ART: Great.


AUSTIN: So give me- give me an intelligence or a dexterity defy. You just have to click it once.


ART: Alright. I’m trying to figure out what skill I want to fail at this with.


AUSTIN: Yep! ‘Cause like the camera with show it differently, right?


ART: Yeah…


AUSTIN: Is it shaky hands? Or is it not knowing which ones to pull out? Or how to dress the wounds?


ART: I think it’s shaky hands, I think that that’s more real.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: That like...I think Hadrian has a basic idea of how to do this, and he’s nervous as hell.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Give me a defy danger dexterity.


ART: I have it, I’m ready, it’s up here, it’s...


AUSTIN: Okay.


ART: I’m nervous, I’m...


AUSTIN: Fair.


ART: I don’t wanna do it, is what’s happening.


AUSTIN: Fair.


ART: I know I have to do it as fast as possible, but I’m like, my finger’s on the fuckin’ left click, I’m…


AUSTIN: [breathes] Deep breath.


ART: I just don’t wanna look. Can I hide my own chat?


AUSTIN: I got you. Holdin’ your hands, through the internet. Hey! That’s a 7. So. 


ART: Oh, it didn’t make the noise, I thought I fucked it up. I almost rolled it three times. [Sylvia laughs]


AUSTIN: So, “You stumble, hesitate, or flinch, the GM will offer you a worse outcome, a hard bargain, or an ugly choice.” So I think here’s the..it’s the worse outcome, which is: you get them out. And he’s—as you’re removing them, like...we don’t need to like zoom in on this, I’m not gonna talk about blood and viscera and shit, but it’s bad. It’s gross, right? Surgery, even in medieval fantasy, is gross. There’s, you know, magic can do some stuff, and having a nice settlement where you’re able to have clean water helps quite a bit, and having like, you know, pans and stuff for you to put the blood in is useful, and all sorts of medical equipment is nice, but like, there’s no IV with painkillers here, you know, there’s no suction. So it’s messy, and it’s bad. The worse—and, Samot is—how do you like knock a god out, right? So through the surgery Samot is awake. And I think at the very end, after you’ve pulled all the stuff out and done your best cleaning of these wounds, two things happen. One is, you cannot stitch the wounds shut.


ART: Mmm.


AUSTIN: They’re open and they are black. Dark black.


ART: Sure.


AUSTIN: Heat and the Dark black.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Sort of like the same wound that Ephrim had in his hand.


ART: Yeah…


AUSTIN: Two...he like reaches up and touches your face. And he’s like,


AUSTIN (as Samot): [weakly] Hadrian…


ART (as Hadrian): Yeah.


AUSTIN (as Samot): I thought you were gone.


ART (as Hadrian): No, I was—I was in the—I was in the blade.


AUSTIN (as Samot): I know. I spoke with him.


ART (as Hadrian): Mm. Yeah, Lem gave him the mask, that’s right. Yeah, it was—


AUSTIN (as Samot): I am dying.


ART (as Hadrian): Don’t say that, we can fix this.


AUSTIN (as Samot): You are very strong.


ART (as Hadrian): I’m not gonna lose—I’m not gonna lose you here. This is- this is gonna be fine. I’m gonna fix this.


AUSTIN: And I think he like nods slowly, and he says,


AUSTIN (as Samot): Life is loss, Hadrian.


AUSTIN: And sleeps. Just kind of slowly turns, and his hand falls calmly to his side, and he falls asleep. And I also think this is where—the fandom got it in their head at the beginning of this season, that it would be dope if Samot’s hair got cut off, I think this is where that happens, actually, is in the surgery. All that blood, all that hair, like down to his fuckin’ waist. Like, the nurses got that shit out of the way immediately. He is in a coma, he’s passed out. The wounds will not close. You will need something else to do that. And he is dying. He is stabilized for now, you’ve bought time, but you did not fully succeed on this roll, and these wounds will kill him eventually. So, that is Hadrian. 


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Who’s next?


ART: Hieron ER.


AUSTIN: Uh huh. [Austin and Dre laugh] Is that one of your new titles? Sword of Samothes, Defender of the Undying Fire, Officer of the Order of Eternal Princes, ER.


ART: MD, I think.


AUSTIN: MD, right, sorry. Yeah, that’s how that goes.


ART: I mean, as medieval doctors go, this is—Hadrian’s honestly as qualified as anyone.


[TIMESTAMP: 1:06:30]


AUSTIN: So, Ephrim, Adaire, Throndir, who wants to go next?


DRE: [sighs] I got like three people I gotta go see. I gotta go see Blue J, I gotta go see Chatterchin and Rosette, and somebody’s gotta go check on Uklan.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


SYLVIA: We could kill two birds with one stone and go check out what Uklan Tel’s deal is now, ‘cause that’s also what I want to do. Or I could handle it, if that makes deciding what you want to do easier.


DRE: I mean, Throndir is happy to follow Ephrim’s lead and to trust Ephrim, so.


AUSTIN: That is what your bond is.


SYLVIA: Alright.


DRE: So I think Throndir might let Ephrim go do it, and go check on Blue J.


AUSTIN: Alright. 


DRE: Unless Ephrim specifically asked Throndir to come with him.


SYLVIA: No no no, that’s fine, go check on Blue J. I can handle Uklan Tel. [Dre laughs]


AUSTIN: Alright, so then let’s start with the Blue J one, ‘cause I think this one’s pretty...not quick necessarily, but...Blue J is in Red Jack’s quarters, and, you know, that’s where they live, obviously, right? And Red Jack’s quarters are like...I think that there is like a sparseness to the room, in terms of the construction of the room. Like, Red Jack did not take over one of the very nice rooms that was already pre-furnished and that had, you know, carpet, or that had nice tile or whatever. It is probably a servant’s quarter, right, but it’s like a chief servant’s quarter. And it’s been adorned with things from all across Red Jack’s long time here, including stuff that Red Jack has made himself. There’s a little like wooden carving of Ace that is up on a shelf, you know, there are knick-knacks from all over Hieron here. And in the moment, they’re in a little side washroom that has just like a bucket of—or not a bucket, but like a—what’s bigger than a bucket but smaller than a bath? A washbin?


ART: A basin?


AUSTIN: A basin, yeah.


DRE: Ooh.


AUSTIN: There’s a basin filled with water, and then a bucket filled with hot water, and then like another basin for dirty water. And Red Jack is like, you know, has washed Blue J’s hair, and is washing their hands, and Blue J is like—I wanna say the little fox creature is here too. And Red Jack hears you come in, and is like,


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Who’s there?


DRE (as Throndir): It’s Throndir.


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Good, Good. Come right in. [quieter] It’s Throndir.


AUSTIN: And Blue J says,


AUSTIN (as Blue J): I heard. [Dre and Austin laugh]


AUSTIN: And you see this. What do you say and do in the—I think actually, when you come in, Red Jack is like, 


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Can you take the pail of dirty water and put it out there?


DRE (as Throndir): Yeah, sure.


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Bring me another empty one in.


DRE (as Throndir): Yeah, I can—I can come back later if you—


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): No no no, come help.


DRE: Okay, yeah, I get rid of the dirty water and bring back an empty one.


AUSTIN: And yeah, I think Blue J is like,


AUSTIN (as Blue J): I’m sorry. I didn’t—


DRE (as Throndir): For what?


AUSTIN (as Blue J): I didn’t help more, I could’ve probably saved someone else.


DRE (as Throndir): Listen, Blue J, I couldn’t have brought Samot back by myself.


AUSTIN (as Blue J): Yeah, but there were other people in there, and—


DRE (as Throndir): There weren’t. 


AUSTIN (as Blue J): There definitely were, there probably were! There were people playing instruments.


DRE (as Throndir): There weren’t.


AUSTIN (as Blue J): You don’t know that! I was closer. It wasn’t just those stone people.


DRE (as Throndir): I know. I know. But if what they did is bringing a god to the brink of death…


AUSTIN (as Blue J): What good is being the Ranger if you can’t save people?


DRE (as Throndir): I mean, you’re not psychic.


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): None of us are.


DRE (as Throndir): Well, Benjamin, sort of.


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Okay, that’s fair, [Dre laughs] you don’t have to bring that up right now, Throndir.


AUSTIN: Blue J’s like, 


AUSTIN (as Blue J): No, that—that’s exactly right. I don’t know magic, I don’t know...maybe all this stuff is not—I don’t, what am I...I just want to help people. I don’t want to hurt people, unless they’re hurting people. But then this happens, and I...I thought I was all grown up.


DRE (as Throndir): Blue J. Your whole life is thinking you’re all grown up, and then something new happens.


AUSTIN: Red Jack says like—I think Red Jack like washes his own hands in the basin at this point, and like turns away a little bit and says like,


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): You will know when you are grown, child. We both will.


AUSTIN: And Blue J says like,


AUSTIN (as Blue J): That’s exactly it, Dad. I know what happens, and I’m not...I’m not that. I’m not gonna do that.


DRE: [quietly] Do I know what happens?


AUSTIN: I don’t think so.


DRE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Trying to think if it ever came up in character. No. And Blue J says like,


AUSTIN (as Blue J): I’m gonna go find Benjamin. Is that okay?


AUSTIN: And Red Jack nods. And the little flower fox comes up onto their shoulder and like gives them a little nuzzle. And Blue J like rubs the snout and like, the flowers like do a little pulse and let out a few glowy spores. And Red Jack says,


AUSTIN (as Red Jack): I do not know where you found that thing, but...be careful.


AUSTIN: And Blue J nods.


DRE: I think Throndir walks out with Blue J and wants to catch them in the hallway away from Red Jack really quick.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm. That happens. What do you say?


DRE (as Throndir): You said more than anything you want to help people.


AUSTIN (as Blue J): Yeah. 


DRE (as Throndir): That’s what makes you the ranger, Blue. I would rather you carry my bow, and because you care so much, I would rather you care that much and get frozen or be not sure what to do, than to not care and to be able to just, bam bam bam, do whatever because you don’t care about the outcome, because you don’t care about how it affects people.


AUSTIN: Meanwhile in the ER, [laughs] Hadrian with a pair of tongs just tossing off the blades.


AUSTIN: Blue J says like,


AUSTIN (as Blue J): That means a lot. That makes sense. But I just know that it’s like, sometimes—it’s like a fox, right? You gotta pounce.


DRE (as Throndir): Yeah.


AUSTIN (as Blue J): Do foxes pounce?


DRE (as Throndir): I don’t—some do, yeah. But it’s not like every—


AUSTIN: I think the fox goes like [animal foley, chirps]


DRE (as Throndir): Listen. It’s not like I...listen, I have fucked up a lot, okay? I have made a lot of mistakes, I have hesitated...that’s what happens when you do this. You don’t always come home feeling great about everything that happened. And the way you get through it is by going to talk to your friends like Benjamin.


AUSTIN (as Blue J): Yeah. It’s funny because I think, when I grew up and I heard stories of the Ranger, I always just thought like...a do-gooder with their friendly animal companion out in the wilderness alone helping people. Drifting, from this town to that. But then I met the Ranger, and it was you and a big dog, and you weren’t alone. You were surrounded by other people too. And sometimes you needed them to help you. And I’m still just, I’m still just...it’s been a long time. I’m still just figuring it out.


AUSTIN: Do you go back in to Red Jack, or do you stay out here?


DRE: Um...no. I think Throndir goes on to go and find Chatterchin and Rosette.


[TIMESTAMP: 1:15:25]


AUSTIN: Okay. Let’s go to Ephrim. Are you going to Uklan Tel’s lab?


SYLVIA: Oh yeah, I’m basically following him right out of there.


AUSTIN: Okay.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Well the thing is, you see, it’s—the Heat and the Dark...it’s easier to show you.


AUSTIN: And leads you into his lab. And his lab is like, bubbling beakers and lots of books spread out. It’s messy, and Uklan Tel has been—always been busy, but messy is not normally what he is, you know what I mean? He’s an archivist, he has lots of, you know, pockets, and lots of bookshelves, and lots of...normally lots of stuff to be—there’s lots of stuff, but it’s not normally...it’s rare that he doesn’t know where a thing he needs is. He like gets to his door and forgets where his key is, you know, like checks three sub-pockets on his outfit. And opens the door, and again it’s like bubbling beakers and all sorts of weird test tubes and potions, and he leads you past a bunch of those, and he goes,


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Mmm. There’s a second—


AUSTIN: And finds a second key, and opens another door. ‘Cause like, this is just his bedroom that he’s also turned into a lab, and then behind that is the actual like, smaller but dedicated laboratory that has like—I think he maybe even has to do like some sort of small pattern to open that door. Something with like, you know, he draws a chalk circle on the door, and then right in the middle of it, he just like squishes a berry of some sort and then draws a symbol with the berry, and then all of that stuff turns to dust and falls onto the ground. And you look down, and there’s just like a line of dust from when he’s done this over and over again that he hasn’t swept up yet. And in the back, as soon as he opens the door, you see both the black fire of the Heat and the Dark under one piece of glass—actually under a bunch of different little pieces of glass, and in various other containers, and then also star-stuff in similar containers. And he says,


AUSTIN (as Uklan): So. Of course the Heat and the Dark is very dangerous, and so I keep it in this room. And what I’ve been studying is how to—you know, the Heat and the Dark, the first thing. Nothing, it’s nothing, it’s not a thing at all. But if you can combine it with the star-stuff, which is the furthest thing there is from the Heat and the Dark, you can get a sort of an alloy. 


AUSTIN: This is a nightmare, Ephrim.


SYLVIA: ...Yeah, it sounds like one. He—so...First of all. He’s been keeping—actually I’m gonna say this to him.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): You’ve been keeping the Heat and the Dark in here without telling us.


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Why do—


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): You know how dangerous that is.


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Of course, that’s why it’s in a special room!


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): You have to tell me these things, Uklan Tel.


AUSTIN (as Uklan): I am, right now. As soon as it was appropriate.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): It was appropriate the second it entered beyond the star-stuff, beyond the barrier we have! That’s when it became important to know about this.


AUSTIN (as Uklan): [stammers] Someone here has to study these things, Ephrim! No one else has the expertise!


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): I agree.


AUSTIN (as Uklan): You can’t rely on this shield forever. Let me show you—


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): I agree, but this causes disease. We have documentation of the Heat and the Dark causing so many problems for us.


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Which is why it’s in this room under this glass. Let me show you what we can do.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Please, do.


AUSTIN: And he goes over to the side and again does a pattern, like takes out...actually, you know, I don’t think this is pattern magic. I think this is like more alchemy. And lifts a beaker that has been—I suspect what he has done is use pattern magic to create implements that can contain these things in small doses. And he does the like kitchen TV show—or the infomercial, not the kitchen TV show, [Sylvia laughs] the infomercial, the like Ron Popeil version of this, [laughs] where he like walks you through the steps of building an alloy between the Heat and the Dark and the star-stuff. And then like baking it, effectively. And he’s like,


AUSTIN (as Uklan): And over here, you can see [laughing out of character] what this would look like if we came back in a week when this process was over.


AUSTIN: And it is like almost a gelatinous substance that is like clear of color. It’s like gelatin. And he says,


AUSTIN (as Uklan): And here’s the thing. Because it is between the Heat and the Dark, the Nothing, and between the star-stuff, the furthest we can leave the Nothing behind, it is almost a perfect resemblance of us, of everything, of matter, of material. It can take different shapes. 


AUSTIN: And so he quickly with like a...I think he actually takes like a smooth scalpel, and very quickly cuts a little slice of it and slides it to the side, as if he’s presenting it, again to go back to the kitchen metaphor. And then like puts the scalpel down quickly, and then takes a- just like a nail file, and he slowly runs the nail file—not a nail file, a chisel, over—like an iron metal chisel over it, and it slowly becomes iron as he’s like rubbing the iron into this alloy. And he says,


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Watch again.


AUSTIN: And he does the scalpel again, and this time the scalpel cut takes too long, and before he can finish, it takes on a metallic quality. He’s like,


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Ah! Too slow.


AUSTIN: Slides it away, and then does it again quickly, and then takes some sand and puts sand on it, and it turns into—well, not sand, we don’t have that anymore, I forgot. [laughs] Takes some dirt, and does it with the dirt. And like,


AUSTIN (as Uklan): It can be anything. I think we just fill Samot up with this!


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): What’s—okay. Say we do that, and this is purely hypothetical, I need us to be very clear on that right now. Say we do that, and he doesn’t—it doesn’t—instead of filling in what’s been damaged, it just, it doesn’t do it properly, and he...what if it makes him die faster, is what I’m saying. What if this just takes over him? 


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Well, it’s always a possibility, a science demands testing.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): [exhales] Alright. So—


AUSTIN: [laughs] Throndir—Dre in the chat says...


DRE: Well, I had this great idea of what if I try to turn Samot into a vampire, and now with Uklan Tel doing this, that idea looks great. [Austin laughs] So we’ll talk about this later. [laughs]


AUSTIN: God…


AUSTIN (as Uklan): I understand your concern.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): We ju— [sighs]


AUSTIN (as Uklan): It’s an option, think of it as an option. If more options show up, I’m happy to hear them, I’m curious! But think of it.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): My—so, you’re not wrong in it still being an option, but this is so far away from being something we can consider yet. I’m trying to—what would you need to test this without using the mortally wounded god as a test subject?


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Unfortunately, I think I would need a different mortally wounded god as a test subject. You’re right, there’s no way to know. I mean...we could use it on you and see, your wound.


SYLVIA: [laughs] We thought of that at the same exact moment. Yeah, I just winced when I realized we could do that. And I think Ephrim does too.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


SYLVIA: But yeah, no, we could…


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): I think that’s our only option to make sure that this doesn’t kill him. ‘Cause it—at least my situation currently is not immediately life-threatening.


AUSTIN (as Uklan): And it is not a simple wound. You see, I’ve tried it on myself, of course. I’ve cut myself and refilled it, and I’ve been fine! But I—my cuts are not the Heat and the Dark, yes? So yours would be a better subject. Though you are not a god, either, or the thing we know Samot once was. And so, there could still be...certain risks. I don’t want to lead you astray. Science always has risks.


SYLVIA: I think at this point, Ephrim’s taking the glove off.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


SYLVIA: And is just nodding, like,


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Yeah, no, I’m- I’m well aware that...one, I’m well aware of the differences between Samot and I, but I think there’s enough similarities of what got inside here, that we might be able to figure something out.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm. So, I wonder if this works.


SYLVIA: [laughs] I sure do too!


AUSTIN: I think what it—so you—so he applies it to you, basically, right? This, like—he has some of the alloy like gelatin available. And, at first, it begins to like, just disappear into the Heat and the Dark. Like it just falls into—where is your arm at, at this point? Where is the—how high up is it?


SYLVIA: Um...let me think. 


AUSTIN: ‘Cause it was a glove at the beginning of the game, but like by the time we got to—or, when it first happened, but...


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Is it above or below the elbow?


SYLVIA: I think that it is—I think at this point it’s above the elbow.


AUSTIN: Okay.


SYLVIA: And I think it’s like—I say glove because that’s what covers the hand—


AUSTIN: Yeah.


SYLVIA: —but it is definitely like, he’s got almost like a compression sleeve, almost?


AUSTIN: Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.


SYLVIA: Covering it up underneath, I think.


AUSTIN: Yeah. And so I think the thing that happens is actually like...it takes a lot more than he thought it would. I think it empties his supply. Or it— [thoughtful] Mmm...you give me a roll.


SYLVIA: Okay.


AUSTIN: Give me a constitution, a defy danger constitution. Which I think you’re good at, right?


SYLVIA: I am! I have a +2. I rolled a 12!


AUSTIN: Look at you, alright. So, it does not use his entire supply. At first, it’s like…“oh no, this is…” It’s like falling into the hole in your arm, into the nothingness, right, it’s being devoured by the Nothing. But bit by bit, like, it starts to be—it’s like nanomachines are covering up the hole. Bit by bit, it’s as if this alloy paste is bringing your flesh back over. It’s not gross, like it actually looks—it looks magical, it almost looks digital happening. And it fills it in, bit by bit. And it—you feel yourself holding the flames of nothing back, because if you didn’t, with your high constitution roll, it would continue to eat up all his supply. But because you do this, you end up with—your arm does not grow back, this is not—


SYLVIA: No.


AUSTIN: —like a magical, [snaps fingers] boom, you get an arm back. But it has stopped—you have cut off where it will go from here. You will not continue to lose this arm and then the rest of your body. Which is good. But, you also now know the reason you were able to do it without it being way more of this stuff, is because you’re conscious and you have your wits about you, and you are strong in constitution, and you were able to like actively help it along. Maybe Samot as a god can do that even in a semi-conscious state...maybe it will take way more. It certainly will take—there’s enough here to try, but having more of this will help, if this is the way you want to go.


SYLVIA: Yeah. I think like the first—the second Ephrim notices that like—the second they’re done and this had positive effect, he’s asking, 


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): How do we get more of this?


AUSTIN (as Uklan): I make more.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): What do you need? What do you need to make more of this?


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Time, mostly. Like I said, it takes about a week for a batch to finish. And I normally run one batch at a time, because it’s very dangerous. But I could run two or three or four if you gave me more room.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Would—do you need people that can help with this?


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Of course, if more people could bring me supplies, I could teach them to recover small bits of [hushed] the materials.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Alright. I’m...I’m not gonna...I can’t commit to anything yet, because I need to know what resources we have, but this went from—this went from being the third option to being much higher. I don’t know what the other options are, I just kinda went with the—


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Much higher, that would be the first, probably.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): [stammers] Look, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I think the first is still normal medical care.


AUSTIN (as Uklan): Of course.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): But, we’re gonna...this is worth looking into. This is huge in so many ways.


[TIMESTAMP: 1:29:17]


AUSTIN: Okay. Adaire. What are you getting up to tonight?


JANINE: I was actually gonna go talk to Ephrim.


SYLVIA: Okay.


JANINE: Does Ephrim have like an office?


SYLVIA: I think we kinda, the closest thing we have is like the meeting hall being like the audience thing.


JANINE: Mmm.


SYLVIA: I think generally speaking on a day like this it would be easy to find him at the central tower, though. Like, that’s where he does most of his business. So, I think there’s probably some sort of office building—or, office room, not office building, [laughs] office room in there that they’ve like put aside for when like either he or Corsica need to do business with somebody away from prying eyes.


JANINE: I was just trying to think of like a place where Adaire would be—


SYLVIA: [softly] Yeah.


JANINE: —that like if Ephrim was leaving that and getting en route to somewhere else that he might stop.


SYLVIA: Oh, okay. I mean, you can probably find—I mean, I’m probably going back and forth between that tree and stuff a bunch, so he’s—like, I’m out in the open, if you want to just track Ephrim down. You can probably catch him just leaving the central tower or the meeting hall easily.


JANINE: Yeah. Where would be a...mmm, hang on, I need to look at this map.


AUSTIN: You can invent a place also, as always. There’s more in the settlement than is on the map.


JANINE: Yeah.


SYLVIA: Speaking of, have we marked where that tree is on the map?


AUSTIN: Yeah, it’s in the aboveground farm? I’ll mark it right now.


JANINE: Okay. I think then Adaire’s probably like...she still has all that shit and she like, would not want to be like standing out in the open like milling around looking for people. So she’s maybe like in the doorway to...somewhere. [laughs] Fuck it. I’m gonna say that she like stashed all the bags of stuff behind Ephrim’s like big fancy ch—he has a fancy chair, right? Not like a super fancy chair, but it’s...


SYLVIA: I think we got a fancy chair that’s not quite a throne, yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: Yeah, it’s like a decent chair.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


JANINE: I think she like whistles him over.


SYLVIA: There’s like a second of like, what, me? Okay, never been..that’s not usually how people get a lord’s attention, but he goes over there, sure.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): What- is everything okay?


JANINE (as Adaire): Okay, so this is gonna sound—this is gonna sound a way that you’re gonna want to judge me, and I’m gonna ask that you don’t judge me like right out of the gate, because it’s going somewhere. But, so, I went down to the river, and I was trying to see if there was any stuff that had fallen in the water that could be retrieved easily, without, you know, getting all...swept away and dead and stuff. And I retrieved some stuff, I don’t know if it’s important or not, there’s like a hilt—or like a scabbard, not a hilt. Like a sheath for a sword, and it’s gold, and I know there’s some stuff with like Samot and weird old swords, so it seems like a thing that maybe he should have like under his pillow or something—I don’t know if that’s very romantic and silly, but. I don’t know. Anyway, I put that—it’s over here. There’s a bag of trade treaties? [Austin laughs quietly] Again, I don’t really fuckin’ know what to do with that, I figured you might. So there’s this Ordennan, and—


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Oh—okay, okay.


SYLVIA: This is where he’s gone from “smiling politely trying not to judge you” mode to...when Ordenna comes up, Ephrim’s like way more engaged and less judgy about it.


JANINE (as Adaire): So they said their name was Carlay de la Carta, which might have been fake, it seemed a little pointed to me, but. [Austin laughs quietly] I suppose it’s possible. And they said some shit.


JANINE: I think like Adaire does her best to relay that like…


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: The time of gods is over, we’re building a continent of iron, come hang out. People don’t have to be scared when we show up in our [laughs] scary ships. I think she conveys that message in its entirety to Ephrim.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Alright. Okay. Thank you. I think I managed to fulfill your request, first of all. No judgement.


JANINE (as Adaire): Cool.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Just wanna make sure we’re clear on that. Thank you for telling me this. I’m gonna get somebody to look over these treaties, and I’m gonna make sure that we keep a lookout on our...well, [sighs] keep a lookout towards the water, I guess, if they’re still trying to come by ship. But it’s good to know who did this.


JANINE (as Adaire): They also moved in a way that was really weird? So…


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Hmm?


JANINE (as Adaire): You know, it’s not like they hopped into a boat in the river, so...I would say maybe keep our...keep things open.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Okay. Right. Okay, thank you.


JANINE (as Adaire): Yeah. I’m gonna go drop this, the sheath off with...a nurse, I guess? I don’t know.


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): I think Hadrian’s in there, he might be able to help.


JANINE (as Adaire): Ugh, okay. [Austin laughs]


SYLVIA (as Ephrim): He’s helping!


JANINE (as Adaire): Yeah, he always helps.


SYLVIA: [laughing] Okay, I think that—I don’t know if I have anything else, but that’s a pretty good...


AUSTIN: That’s good. Yeah, let’s do the Hadrian Adaire catch-up. I think you go in there, and Hadrian, you’re—he’s stabilized, you’re still with him?


ART: Yeah, but probably not doing a lot at the moment, right, probably just like…


AUSTIN: A thing I’ll note, real quick, is...so this is a fun thing. You’ve done what you can, with what—we’ve already done the roll and all that. What was that roll, that roll ended up being...an 8, right? Yeah. 


ART: Great question.


AUSTIN: No, roll was a fail. You failed, you failed that roll.


SYLVIA: It was a 4, I think?


AUSTIN: It was a 4. One of the things I should—


ART: [crosstalk] The discern, yeah.


AUSTIN: Oh, the discern was a—you’re right. The defy was a 7, you’re right.


SYLVIA: Okay.


AUSTIN: There’s a world in which that should have been a failure, but I’m gonna let it ride, because a thing I remembered is that your settlement has a deficiency, because if you check Lord Ephrim’s sheet, one of the things that the settlement needs is medicine.


SYLVIA: [faintly] God, yeah.


AUSTIN: It’s the one true need there. And so what I’m gonna roll here is like—I’m not gonna take that 7 away from you, that’d be shitty. But like, you’re kind of out of stuff. And, Adaire, I think that strikes you when you enter this room, is like, it’s a lot of empty shelves.


JANINE: Mmm.


AUSTIN: And I mean, there’s not enough gauze left. For people.


JANINE: Yeah...


AUSTIN: There’s not enough like- like cleaning—like, what’s the word I’m looking for.


ART: Like disinfectant?


AUSTIN: Disinfectants, yeah. There’s not enough, like very basic—again, like, maybe the reason you couldn’t give Samot anything for the pain, like including herbs or whatever, is you were out of that stuff. Ironically, Ephrim, when you go to check those treaties, one of the things that Samot is eager to trade to you is medical supplies, at like a very good exchange rate or whatever, right? Those treaties are really good. Like those treaties are like...an open faucet to this burgeoning community. So like, yeah, that would’ve been good if all that was here before this happened. But instead, instead we have Hadrian in an empty operating room, alone with a dying god. And Adaire.


ART: Oh, I just want this room to be giant.


AUSTIN: Oh yeah.


ART: I want this to be like a giant operating room and just like, little table, little chair, big Hadrian.


AUSTIN: It is, right, like there were wars outside this place.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Hair on the ground still.


ART: Yeah. But like—and like, not enough light, I don’t know.


AUSTIN: No, definitely not.


ART: I don’t want to tell people how to draw this, that’s uh… [Art and Janine laugh]


AUSTIN: Uh huh. I’m trying to think if there’s anything else. And, Hadrian, on your part, are you holding this sheath, Janine? Or, Adaire?


JANINE: Yeah, at this point. ‘Cause she’s dropped off the parchment and stuff, so.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Hadrian, as soon as you see that sheath, you know what that sheath is for, which is your Samothes sword?


ART: Mmhmm.


AUSTIN: It’s just like, oh, okay. Like it matches. There’s like—they must have talked about what cool sword Samothes made you, and Samot and Samothes must have like planned a gift to give you, which would be like “oh, you’re always better at decorating shit anyway.’


ART: Aww.


AUSTIN: And so, it’s like a really beautiful sheath for that cool sword you have.


ART: It’s probably back at the house.


AUSTIN: Yeah, you probably didn’t bring it into the OR. The ER—this is the ER, this is not...yeah.


ART: I mean, it’s probably just the—it’s probably multi—


JANINE: The R.


AUSTIN: The R, right, yeah, the room. [laughs]


ART: The big R.


AUSTIN: [laughing] That’s what they call it, the big R! [Art laughs] And now I’m gonna get out of your way, and you can have this conversation.


JANINE: I think Adaire like looks a little bit incredulous, ‘cause like, she hasn’t been in here before and also has—you know, she knows the state of the settlement at this point, but also has certain expectations of like what a medical area in a former fuckin’ university whatever the hell—


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: —would maybe look like. And it’s not like completely out of gauze, like empty bottles strewn everywhere [laughs] or whatever.


AUSTIN: Mmhmm.


JANINE: I think there’s like a lot of gawking. 


JANINE (as Adaire): Hey, Hadrian. I have this...I think it was in Samot’s like caravan or whatever? It was in the river, and I fished it out, ‘cause it looked important. 


ART (as Hadrian): Thank you. Thanks, thank you. That’s—it’s beautiful. 


JANINE (as Adaire): Yeah, it’s okay. Are you alright? You’re kind of like, low-voiced.


ART (as Hadrian): [laughs slightly] No, it’s—this has been terrible. I’m exhausted. I don’t think I helped. It’s—he says he’s—he says it’s—he doesn’t think he’s gonna make it.


JANINE (as Adaire): Well, if he said anything at all, you probably helped a little.


ART (as Hadrian): Ha. Yeah, I guess. I just don’t—I just don’t know what I’m doing anymore.


JANINE (as Adaire): I mean, that’s probably a fair reaction. A lot of people don’t seem to.


ART (as Hadrian): I’m sorry, you probably didn’t just come here for me to be morose at you.


JANINE (as Adaire): Not usually, but like, you know. I don’t have anywhere else to be.


ART (as Hadrian): [laughs quietly] You have any tinctures in your bag for this?


JANINE (as Adaire): I mean, I actually—I don’t know that they’re—I have some stuff, but I don’t know that it’s like…[Austin laughs quietly] [sighs] You know. 


AUSTIN: Mmhmm!


JANINE: What’s the actual...I use my poison so rarely that I just…


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: Do I not—oh, I don’t even have the description of what it does in my inventory. [laughs]


AUSTIN: Which one do you have?


JANINE: Oil of tagit? Tagit?


AUSTIN: That’s “target falls into a light sleep”.


JANINE: Okay. Right.


AUSTIN: I think that that would be like a nice thing to have on hand over the next week.


JANINE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Because Samot will be in and out of consciousness and in a lot of pain. And so—


JANINE: I mean, I can brew more of that.


AUSTIN: Yeah, totally. So, let’s—


JANINE: That’s like a thing I can do when I have time. I think that’s—yeah, that’s probably a thing that Adaire offers.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: Like that’s—you know, I haven’t like mainlined poisons with this [laughs] build or whatever.


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh huh, you haven’t made a poison build.


JANINE: But that is the one thing that Adaire can reliably do is make sleep potions.


AUSTIN: Yeah. I think that that’s genuinely really—also, more useful than the other potions [laughing] you can make, that like make people do less damage, in this situation.


JANINE: I mean, you could probably give that to a doctor, and it’d be great.


AUSTIN: Yeah, that’s true. Any other convo here, or do we move on?


JANINE: I think Adaire just offers to like hang out and like brew potio—brew poison, but also maybe like boil some rags.


AUSTIN: Sure, yeah. And that matters.


ART: We can—we can do as much of this as you want, I mean. But I don’t know how—how much you or Adaire really cares to do it.


JANINE: You know, she probably asks like, how’s the wife. Like she makes small talk. 


ART: Sure, yeah.


JANINE: None of it is—it’s not the kind of conversation you’d have with Hella, but it’s like, she makes a small effort.


ART: And it probably helps a lot, you know, Hadrian is fuckin’ up against it right now.


ART (as Hadrian): And she’s great. It’s really nice to be back, I’m really proud of how she’s grown into this community. I wish I felt as at home here as she does.


JANINE (as Adaire): Eh, give it time. Benjamin does magic now, huh? Like what’s his deal? What’s that story?


AUSTIN: [laughs quietly] Great, good.


ART (as Hadrian): He’s—it’s amazing, it’s...it’s so gratifying to see your children grow into things that you could never do. I don’t know if that’s ever something you wanted to do, but it’s really wonderful.


JANINE: I like half want her to make a joke about like, maybe you’ll get lucky and he’ll get really good and he’ll make a second son for you, but like, too soon? I don’t know. [Janine, Art, and Austin laugh]


ART: I don’t know. Gallows humor is always fun. [Janine laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART (as Hadrian): I mean, I probably trust him more than Uklan Tel right now. 


JANINE (as Adaire): That’s fuckin’ fair.


JANINE: [crosstalk] I don’t know that Adaire knows enough about Uklan Tel to...


ART: [crosstalk] I don’t remember if I was still in the room when that happened.


JANINE: Adaire was not. Otherwise—she would have some opinions, if she overheard that—


AUSTIN: Oh yeah, I bet.


JANINE: —creepy, creepy talk, for sure. And it’s probably that scene.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Well, it would be, but there’s a roar. This is a long night. Who...Ephrim, you’re the one who’s like between things, right? You’re like constantly moving between different places. They cannot cut that fucking tree down. They were trying so hard, but regular axes aren’t gonna do it. However much they cut, however many branches they break, more continue to grow.


[“Something” by Jack de Quidt begins playing]


SYLVIA: Alright. I’m gonna like—after hearing the Ordennan news, I think I was gonna come out there and re-assign those guys to like get back to their regular units anyway.


AUSTIN: Yeah. So I think you do that, and as soon as that happens, that’s when the roar happens. And a gigantic green dragon appears in the night sky to the north.


[“Something” continues to the end]
