SPRING IN HIERON 33: PARTICULAR MALICE
Transcriber: Cole
(Recap)
Austin: Like, if this is a thing you’re genuinely interested in, there could be a knock at the door. Corsica’s scouts could be like, ‘we know where the dragon is.’
----
Austin: So, yeah. So, uh, the Advocate is- the Advocate, I- you know, who could say why is back at the Mark of the Erasure. At Samot’s fallen tower. So, yeah. One of the places a body might be able to be made. [Jack exhales and laughs]
Keith: I’m fuckin’ ready to go.
[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” begins playing in the background]
----
Austin: I will tell you, the reward for doing this right now [Ali laughs] is incredible. [Janine laughs] And I don’t have to change shit. Like, it is- it is- I don’t have to change shit! [Sylvia, Janine, and Ali laugh]
----
Austin: For the two of you seeing this place turn to ash for miles is very weird. Seeing like, the- the uncovered stone of the mountains that are here where there had been trees and snow before, green and white, replaced with just like, gray and brown is strange. Seeing the embers of the Heat and the Dark and of the Advocate's red flames is also strange. It feels haunted.
----
Austin: But you’re going to have an opportunity to keep it down on the ground and you have to do that no matter what. Like, you could get it down to one HP, and it could be like, ‘I gotta go. Bye.’
Keith: Ok.
Austin: So, you have to deal with its wings somehow.
----
Austin: You see kind of howling energy from where there is kind of raw, unshaped possibility. So, magic, basically. There’s raw rupture. And on top of it, on top of that part of the building is the apocalypse dragon- is the Advocate. Um, and it is asleep. And that is what you get for succeeding on so many of those rolls. It’s asleep.
----
Austin: Fero, you’ve- Ok, so you’ve dropped them off. You’re hovering above it. It’s snoring in this way that’s erasing the sound. What- what does your weird dragon centipede wrapping it up look like?
Keith: So, it just sort of starts falling, and as it falls, the falling slows and then it just hits on top of the dragon and just kind of, in an instant just thrashing and grabbing.
Austin: And as it’s doing that, from your back, Red Jack in all of his armor leaps from you and grab- grabs onto the very front of the Advocate.
Keith: How big is Red Jack that… that Red Jack has control of this thing’s face? Is its face-
Austin: Control’s a strong word.
Keith: Ok. That he can even reach its chin and its like, snout.
[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” finished playing as the recap nears finish]
Austin: Red Jack is a giant. Red Jack is a giant oni, right? Red Jack is- is-
Keith: Right.
Austin: Red Jack big. [laughs] Red Jack big.
Keith: But isn’t its like, head the size of a house?
Austin: His head’s the size of like a- I’ve been imagining it as like, bigger than a car, bigger than a truck, but not quite a house. I think- But I think like-
Keith: Like a little story house?
Austin: Think about it like Red Jack- You know maybe it’s like on the ground holding this thing by the nostrils and shoving down into the ground. Do you know what I mean?
Keith: Oh, yeah. That makes it so much sense.
Austin: Like pulling a garage door down.
Keith: Right.
Austin: [laughing] Except instead of a garage door, it’s a face.
Keith: Right, yeah.
Austin: Um, and just like, feet- just ‘rrr’ like, holding down as best as it can as the body thrashes. But uh- but again, this is a moment where- this is the first attack, and y’all all got the drop on it. Which means everybody’s going to get the ability to hit this thing once- just like, to swing on it once basically without you know- as a sneak attack effectively.
Keith: Uh hm.
Austin: It can still counterattack. Failures will still require- you know, will still hurt people, but it- One, I don’t think it’s gonna hurt this away group very much, and two- like, the far group. And two, it can’t fly away, which is a big thing. And it can’t like, take to the air because you have it pinned to the ground. Who swings first on this fuckin’ thing?
[crosstalking]
Ali: Keith?
Art: I’ll do it. 
Austin: Also, you rolled 1d8 to do damage. No. The claw- your- your centipede claws are unable to pierce its thick, metal hide. 
Art: Oh fuck. 
Ali: Oh, so we have to figure out this hide thing, and then we’ll be ok.
Austin: No, no, that’s Fero. I’m saying Fero. 
Ali: Ok. Ok. Ok. Um-
Keith: Did we know it had a metal hide?
Austin: We did not. No one had been on it before. 
Keith: I’m on it. 
Ali: Wait, you said it like, a second ago. No, no. 
Austin: I did. But now we know. [Ali laughs] Yes. 
Ali: Can we start with like, a combo attack? Just for old times’ sake. [Ali and Janine laugh lightly] 
Austin: Hell yeah. What’s that look like?
Art: Sure. 
Austin: We don’t have like, a special move here, but we have three people with swords. [Ali laughs] 
Ali: Um, should we all target like, a single leg? Or… part?
Keith: I bet you could- you could try and damage one like really badly. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Janine: This is- Sorry, this is gonna be a little bit gross. I’m apologizing in advance for people who don’t like it when I say these kinds of things. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: What if you two stab it through the front of the neck, and I stab it through the back of the neck. Or vice-versa. Or possibly in the sides, and we try and meet in the middle. [Austin makes a ‘grossed out’ noise] 
Ali: Ohhh. 
Jack: Also, do we maybe want to consider- I know it’s pinned right now, but do we maybe want to take a swing at the wings?
Janine: That’s actually- Yeah. 
Jack: Just as early as possible. 
Janine: Why don’t we-
Keith: I do- I do have- I do use hold when I use the grapple. I do not have unlimited grapple. I will have to regrapple this thing. 
Austin: That’s true. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Jack: Probably wings. 
Janine: Yeah, that’s a hundred percent a good- good idea. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Ok. 
Janine: I mean, the thing about wings is you take one out, and that’s it. 
Austin: You only need to take out the one. 
Ali: Yeah, let’s- Yeah. 
Austin: Let me-
Janine: You can’t- you can’t something something one winged angel. 
Austin: Uh huh. Um, I’m gonna make a note to myself. 
Keith: Of how much damage a wing can take?
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Wings seem like a relatively fragile part of anything with wings. 
Austin: Yeah. And also to be clear-
Janine: It depends on if you’re talking about the membrane or like the bone or- 
Austin: Right, totally. Yep. Ok. So, this thing is thrashing the fuck around. Y’all move in. Nothing from range party that’s like a set up move for them at all? Right?
Dre: So, all my Trick Shot said is when you go for an improbable shot with an unusual effect. So, could I go for a shot that would give them all like, a plus to a roll or like, extra damage or something?
Austin: I think that’s mostly a fictional thing. That would be like-
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: -‘I want to clip its wings when it’s in the air.’ 
Dre: Ok. 
Austin: But I don’t think- It doesn’t give a- like, a flat- That would be a huge thing to leave in that am- ambiguous space. Do you know what I mean? 
Dre: Yeah, no. For sure 
Austin: But hold onto that again. That’s a good back pocket move. Alright, I think we just do this damage then. We just do this attack. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: This set of attacks. 
Ali: Yeah, are we just all gonna…
Art: Alright, what- what kind of roll is this?
Austin: These are Hack and Slash rolls. These are independent Hack and Slash rolls. 
Art: Just indepen- Ha- Ok, got it. 
Austin: Oh yeah. 
Keith: No roll to attack. Just the thing, right?
Austin: No. This is- It’s awake now. 
Keith: Oh, no. Ok. Yeah. 
Austin: You’ve grappled it. It is awake. It is- it is everywhere. Um, Adaire is invisible. 
Janine: Is it surprised? Would you say it’s surprised? [laughing] 
Austin: Adaire is invisible, so yes. You- you will get a Backstab on this thing. 
Janine: Alright. 
Keith: Nice. 
Austin: Uh, Hadrian, eleven. That’s a good hit. 
Art: If I accidentally rolled it a hundred times, I’m sorry. 
Austin: You did. 
Art: It didn’t happen. 
Austin: Hadrian, you rolled it four times. [Austin and Janine laugh] But your first one was an eleven, and we’re gonna count that one. 
Ali: Ok. I’ll roll now. 
Austin: Hella. [shouting] Fourteen! What's good?!
Ali: Yay!
Keith: Woah. 
Dre: God. 
Austin: Uh huh, and?
Ali: I- I also get to choose something physical on my target; a weapon, their position, a limb, and they use it.
Austin: They- Yeah, uh huh. 
Ali: They lose it. 
Keith: Did you say they use it or they lose it?
Austin and Ali: [simultaneously while laughing] They lose it. 
Keith: OK. A limb? So like a wing.
Austin: For- for instance, like a wing. 
Ali: Like a wing. 
Austin: So, I think that wing is toast! Um, Hella let’s start with your damage, so you just- since you’re going after this wing. 
Ali: Oh yeah. Hold on.
Keith: That’s three ten pluses, by the way. 
Austin: It was a twelve, a fourteen, and an eleven. Alright, so is that nine, Hella? Is that total?
Ali: That’s my damage. Yeah. 
Austin: Alright, so nine. Fwooh my god. It’s just so powerful, but you do clip its wing. What’s that look like? God, that could not have gone better, honestly. 
Ali: Sick. [laughs]
Keith: Have you ever- have ever prepped a chicken? Like a- like a dead chicken to be cooked?
Austin: Not like a complete one. 
Art: No. Why did you specify dead chicken? [Austin laughs] 
Sylvia: What? [Jack laughs] 
Keith: Well, be- I’m just saying I’m not talking about butchering a chicken. I’m ju- I’m talking about when you pop the wing off of the bo- the body of the chicken. 
Dre: Oh, yeah. 
Austin: [uncomfortably] Ugh, yeah. Do you think it’s that? It’s like, ‘pop.’ Like, get that sword in there, ‘pop.’ And the wing just goes flailing off to the side? [Ali groans uncomfortable] But that’s not like-
Keith: It’s like the size of a house, right?
Austin: It’s bigger than a house. That wing is-
Art: But this isn’t like, objectively that much damage, right? Is this more like you just like- I don’t know. I don’t-
Austin: Is this like a single slash and then the wing just falls?
Ali: Well, it could be like- [laughs] it could be two of the swords like, getting into the joint [Austin makes uncomfortable sound] and then the third sword like, cutting it off-
Austin: It could be that. 
Ali: -through the membrane, right?
Art: Or this could like a ligament damage thing. 
Austin: Alright, we’re gonna move on.
Art: We could do-
Austin: We’re gonna move on. [Keith laughs] 
[crosstalking] 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: I shouldn’t have started it.
Janine: It’s the thing-
Art: -internal and not external damage. 
Austin: Wow, you cut off its wings. Sick. 
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: Uh, give me more damage from people. Either Hadrian or Adaire. 
Keith: How much damage did that nine do, by the way?
Austin: You don’t get to know that. 
Art: I’ll do the plus 1d6 and open myself to attack. 
Austin: Oh, you’re gonna do the bonus damage. Right. Uh, Hella, you could have also chosen that. I choose- I forgot to tell you that. I’m sorry. 
Ali: Oh, that’s the thing?
Austin: Wait, also don’t you do bonus damage from that thing? Do you only just cut extra bits off?
Ali: No, I don’t have my um-
Austin: Oh right. That’s not- You don’t have that anymore. 
Ali: Yeah, I used to have the mean one where I was mean, and then I took it away. 
Austin: Right. 
Ali: I had like, Seeing Red or whatever. 
Austin: You could have chosen to take damage, but do an extra 1d6 or whatever. [Janine sighs] 
Art: Holy shit!
Ali: Well, we got a second hit in. 
Austin: Hadrian.
Ali: Oh… [laughs lightly]
Austin: Hadrian, what the fuck happened?
Art: Um, I rolled a two and a one. It’s worth noting that this three ignores armor. 
Austin: It does go through his armor. That makes it good. That makes it a good hit still. 
Keith: Yeah, you did better than my six damage. 
Austin: Uh, which turned into none. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Actually, you know what? I’m gonna give it- I’m gonna say that that six still did one, Fero. 
Keith: Ok. 
Austin: Which reveals in fact that it has five armor. I’m gonna say that five armor is its metallic hide, so it does pierce. It’s just really hard to pierce it. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: In this case, Hadrian’s sword-
Keith: Those are big-
Austin: -does get in there. Cause it’s-
Art: I don’t think this was worth exposing myself to the counterattack though. I mean honestly. 
Austin: Bruh, this is about- I’m gonna- I’ll get to the counterattack in a moment. Adaire, go ahead and do your damage. 
Janine: Uh, right. So, I’m doing…
Austin: Can you talk us through all of your ridiculous damage first?
Janine: [laughs]  Right. So, because I have- ok, so first thing first is I got eleven on Backstab, which means I get to choose two of the detail things. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: Plus do 1d6 for Cheap Shot. So, the two things I’m gonna choose are you deal your damage plus 1d6, and that again will have another 1d6 on top of that. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: And so that’s 1d8 plus 2d6. And then I’m going to choose you don’t get into a melee with him which I think we established means I maintain my invisibility. 
Austin: You get to stay invisible, yeah. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: Also, you get to add the- You also get to add Barbelo’s ferocity to your damage. 
Janine: What does that mean?
Austin: What’s your ferocity score on Barbelo?
Janine: Two. 
Austin: So, add plus two to whatever your damage roll ends up being. 
Janine: Ok, so-
Austin: Cause you have-
Janine: 2d6 plus 1 d8 plus two?
Austin: Fuck. 2d6, wait. Wait, start over. 2d6?
Janine: Yeah, 1d6 for-
Austin: Yes, 1d6, 1d- Yes. 
Janine: -for the Backstab bonus plus Cheap Shot plus my damage. 
Jack: Jesus Christ. 
Austin: Yeah, uh huh. 
Janine: [laughing] Plus my dog. 
Austin: Yeah, Adaire is a fucking killer. [laughs] Adaire became the- It’s unbelievable. As long as Adaire is not in a fight up front, like backstabs are just brutal. Go ahead and do the damage. 
Janine: In- in Winter, I designed her to be like, she’s gonna be a thief, but she’s gonna be terrible at fighting. 
Austin: You did- Yeah, uh huh. You did say that. 
Keith: Wait, so wait- So, what’s- what is your total damage? 
Janine: Nine. 
Keith: It’s 2d6 plus 1 d8 plus two. Wow.
Austin: Uh huh, but I actually-
Keith: That could have been better. It is still nine. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: Still nine. Still nine. 
Keith: Two twos and a one plus a four. 
Austin: Does armor...  Here’s a very important question that I should know. And I’m gonna look it up instead of thinking right now. 
Keith: We should try and do that reduce armor thing- 
Austin: [overlapped] Uh…
Keith: -from Backstab. 
Janine: Yeah, I- I have a lot of- I have a lot of shit I can do with Backstab, but a lot of it is the- As long as like- Maintaining the invisibility is very important to me not dying. Um, [laughs] so that’s kind of my focus until it breaks, and then we’ll do some fun side stuff, but…
Austin: Um, one second. I just need to look at the way that Backstab is phrased. Yeah, ok. You’re good. Cause it’s plus 1d6 damage-
Janine: yeah. 
Austin: -which means that’s all one hit. It’s not multiple hits.
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: So, you did some good damage again. Um, the three of you manage-
Janine: And it’s piercing, right? Cause it’s a… thing.
Austin: Yes, but what’s the piercing number? Is it one piercing? Is it two piercing?
Janine: It’s one piercing. Yeah. 
Austin: Ok. 
Janine: Close, precise, one piercing. 
Keith: Five damage?
Austin: So, five damage, yeah. Not bad. Alright, well real quick. Hadrian, two things happen. One, Red Jack uh, has held on as best as he can and got you this first set of roun- this first round. Cannot anymore. And I think is like- I think that we see the Advocate kind of slam his- er its claws into the ground and push, and like uses that pressure to fling Red Jack away. Like, off the side of- of the building. And we get like, a closeup of Red Jack holding on with- with his hands, and then like, yelling, 
Austin (as Red Jack): Ace!
Austin: And then we hear, of course, the thundering hoofprints- er hoof- hoofbeats of Ace, as Ace is like, running to try to be like, underneath Red Jack. Like, stories and stories underneath cause Red Jack is about to fall, and Ace is gonna- Ace is gonna catch his- his favorite person in the world. In fact, I think we lose Ace- Ace’s foot- like, hoof- hoofbeats because now freed, the dragon roars, and removes all sound. And so we just get the like, gallop. I can’t do a gal- [Austin does gallop foley] and then just like-
Ali: Ooo. 
Austin: -and then gone as sound disappears. As the dragon roars. So, it is screaming. And again, sound is just completely-  is just like, all the way removed at this point, as it howls and roars. Um, and in fact because it is the full Advocate, that effect lingers in the air for a- like, a turn in between each of its roars. So, it rolls the best of those two, so six plus nine is fifteen damage, Hadrian. 
Art: Alright, I’m gonna have to uh- Does that pierce? Is that… armor-
Austin: That goes through all of your armor.
Art: Alright. I want to-
Austin: That’s why- Remember when I asked how much armor everybody had, and I says, ‘does anybody have more than four? No?’ Ok.’ So, it’s gonna- None of your armor matters unless you get to five. 
Art: Alright. I will Bloody Aegis. 
[0:15:00]
Austin: You take a debility instead of the damage, right?
Art: I take a debility instead of the damage. 
Austin: So, which debility are you taking?
Art: Great question. [Austin exhales a laugh, followed by Art] Confused?
Austin: Sure. I think it just like, back slaps you with one of its front claws and sends you into like, a pile of rubble in the distance- against it, and like, it- it- You know, it would have like, broken your back, but you’re Hadrian, and you push through it and maybe move your back just so so that it doesn’t break your back. Far team. 
Dre: Hm. 
Jack: Ok. [sighs] Now do we want plan… orc army? Or do we-
Dre: Or plan wizard army?
Jack: I don’t want wizards. [Austin laughs] 
Dre: Ok. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Dre: Fair. 
Jack: Um, like I would- Yeah, we should take a moment to remind ourselves where the Mark of the Erasure came from before we start bringing wizards into the Mark of the Erasure. 
Austin: It was uh… wizards who did it. Wizard-
Ali: Oh. 
Jack: Yeah, it was wizards, wasn’t it?
Austin: A wizard did it. Yeah. 
Dre: Mmm. 
Ali: You don’t say. 
Jack: Um, do we think that orc army plan is going to take up too much of my time that I could spend doing something more useful like learning about history? [Dre laughs] 
Sylvia: Uhhh…
Keith: Can you- can you attack the mon- the dragon? Directly. 
Jack: Uh, not while I’m getting the orc army here. 
Austin: But you’re saying just generally?
Keith: Just like ins- I mean, instead of. Like, do you have a move that can do the dam- just damage?
Jack: I could, but a full army of orcs would be much better than me. 
Dre: Mm. 
Jack: And if I try it, and we find that it doesn’t work, I can get to attacking the dragon. 
Keith: Ok. 
Jack: I’m just saying like, do we want to take the risk here of- of like-
Austin: -introducing an entire new culture of orcs?
Dre: Hm.
Ali: You put it like that…
Keith: This- I mean, this place-
Jack: What am-
Keith: - might still be doomed. So, that would suck if we doomed a bunch of orcs. 
Austin: Oh, they might be doomed anyway. 
Keith: They might be doomed anyway, but like-
Austin: If the world is destroyed, they are also destroyed. 
Jack: Oh, ok. Right. 
Dre: Oh, ok. 
Jack: And so it is- it’s ultimately in the orcs’ interest. 
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [Keith laughs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. [Sylvia laughs] 
Jack: I mean-
Keith: We bring you here for your own good. 
Ali: Now fight this dragon, please.
Austin: [laughing] Uh huh. Right. I want to be clear. It’ll work. You can convince them to fight this dragon. I do think diplomatically speaking, it’s a rough introduction. 
Jack: It’s not only a rough introduction, it’s also like, how many orcs are they willing to send, cause if it’s six, they’re all gonna die instantly. [Austin laughs] 
Dre: You say when there is seven of us. [Dre, Sylvia, Ali, and Jack laugh] 
Keith: Well, seven is what- what they need to send. [Austin exhales] 
Dre: Yeah, ok. Yeah, no. 
Keith: If they send seven then we’re all good. 
Dre: That’s- Yeah, that’s the tipping point. [laughing] 
Sylvia: It’s the lucky number. 
Jack: So, maybe… so it sounds like maybe we hold off on orcs unless it gets really desperate? 
Dre: Sure. 
Keith: Maybe let’s-
Jack: In which case-
Keith: -let’s see what you can do with a move, and then-
Jack: Let’s see what I can do from a distance?
Keith: Yeah, and then if that’s not working out-
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: -then maybe we can bring the orcs. 
Jack: Ok, yeah- [laughs] Yeah, that works for me. Which of you two uh, with me, are the biggest damage dealer?
Austin: Good question. 
Sylvia: I think it’s Throndir, out of the two of us.
Austin: In terms of just raw dice… it’s probably Throndir. 
Dre: Ummm.
Jack: I don’t- Actu-
Austin: Though with the Burning Brand, I don’t know. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Jack: My Hack and Slash doesn’t actually…  it does a- it just does flat 1d4 additional. So, like it actually doesn’t matter who has the most- who has the most damage. 
Austin: Also, you can’t do Hack and Slash from this far away. I mean, that to- to Lem. So like, you couldn’t-
Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that’s true. 
Austin: You can’t actually do Setup Strike in this case. 
Jack: So, I’m- I’m on Arcane Art and Metal Hurlant right now.
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. Arcane Art also gives that plus 1d4 , but it doesn’t do- Yeah. In fact, actually wait. 
Jack: Uh hm. 
Austin: Doesn’t it do more than thaaaat? What’s it do?
Jack: No, 1d4. Plus 1d4. 
Austin: 1d4. Right, ok. 
Jack: Ok, I mean- I- I’m prepared to… 
Keith: Oh! I’m sorry.
Jack: Hm?
Keith: Um-
Austin: Hi. 
Keith: Adaire, did you do the 1d4 from your magic weapon?
Austin: Oh, you didn’t! Also, do 1d4 more. 
Janine: That’s a good point. 
Dre: Oh, good call. 
Janine: I totally did not do that. 
Austin: Good catch. 
Janine: Thank you, yeah. 
Austin: Just give it a little like, turn when it’s in there, you know?
Janine: That’s a four. That was worth it. 
Austin: Jesus Christ. 
Dre: Hey!
Keith: Nice! Holy mackerel. 
Janine: That made up for the shittier rolls. 
Austin: It really did. 
Keith: Yeah, so that’s- You- 
Austin: That’s big. That’s a big ex-
Keith: So, that means you did nine total damage, right?
Austin: That’s good damage against this thing. 
Keith: This thing’s probably half dead or more. I don’t know. [Jack laughs]
Janine: I probably should have tried to fight this thing properly one of the other two times I fought it. 
Austin: [laughs] Yeah, uh huh. 
Jack: Um, I’m trying to work out whether or not I want to be in a support role or just take a swing at this thing from a distance with a violin. Um… 
Austin: I kind of feel like this might be the moment- Uh, you decide. I’m not gonna say anything.
Keith: While- while Lem is deciding- While Jack is deciding what Lem does, um, is- is this- Is this thing saying anything?
Austin: Um… like, to you as Fero? Like, because you can-
Keith: Or just like, is it when it screams did it say something that like-?
Austin: No, because it’s- it’s removing sound from the world. 
Keith: Right. But like, if I could talk to things, maybe I can hear the sounds. 
Austin: Um, what it’s doing… Yeah, so that’s the thing is I will say what you can hear is that like, do you- Everytime it roars, it’s actually damaging the- the structure of the world. 
Keith: So, it’s the same. 
Austin: Um, you’re hearing- It’s erasing- it’s- You know how you have Thing Talker, you can talk to things?
Keith: Uh hm. 
Austin: Remember, I was like some things don’t have speech anymore? That- when it roars, it’s- it’s stripping selfhood away from things. 
Keith: That’s- that’s why there are not really any-
Austin: Yeah. Even from places that don’t look burned. 
Keith: -um, rel- uh, resident spirits?
Austin: Yes. 
Keith: Alright. 
Austin: Yeah, it is killing resident spirits every time it does that. It’s-
Keith: Hm. 
Austin: And- and I think part of this actually is you actually see that that includes some of these like, realms of potentiality. Um, like, as it- as it makes the sound, you can sense that like, the living beings in these alternate potential worlds are actually harmed by it. Not in a way that’s very direct or clear to them necessarily. There’s a lot of confusion from there. But it’s like- I would imagine that this is like, they have- there’s a plague in their societies, and they don’t know why. Cause they can’t leave. They can’t go outside and say, ‘Oh yeah, an apocalypse dragon showed up. The- the uh, Doombringer, the- the you know, the Bringer of the Nothing is here, and it’s causing us all to be sick all the time. It’s dragging all the life out of us constantly.‘ Um, they can’t tell that. But you know. 
Jack: Ok. Uh, I’m gonna cast Arcane Art.
Austin: Ok. 
Jack: Um, and I’m gonna target Adaire. 
Austin: Ok. 
Jack: And I would like to give her a plus 1d4 to damage. 
Austin: Hell yeah. 
Jack: Um, because the thought of Adaire as just like, a walking ball of dice right now-
Austin: [laughs] Is very good. 
Jack: [laughing] -is extremely amusing to me. 
Dre: Uh hm. 
Austin: Uh huh. Give me a 2d6 plus charisma, which is a- a plus two. 
Jack: Ok. [overlapped] I want to use-
Austin: And you have that hold still. You’re gonna hold that hold. 
Jack: I’m- I’m gonna hold onto that one. 
Austin: Alright, so-
Jack: Cause charisma is a really good stat for me-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: -whereas constitution is slightly less so. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Um, so I want to you know, save that on that. Ok. Here we go. 
Austin: That’s a nine. 
Jack: That is a nine. Oh, did it use my plus one forward? I think it did. 
Austin: It did, but that’s fine. Just add it back. I don’t know why it- Oh, it should be plus one hold, not plus one forw- Hm… hmm. 
Keith: There’s a- there’s a hold- there’s a plus one forward button, but to the right of that there’s a hold. 
Janine: Yeah,.
Jack: No, I’ve got that selected. So, I don’t know why it-
Austin: Weird. So, I think it just- It- Maybe the sheet just doesn’t do the thing we think it does. That’s fine. 
Jack: So, should we just say that that’s an eight? 
Austin: It’s an eight. It’s an eight, yeah. 
Jack: And- yeah. 
Austin: So, ‘your spell still works, but you draw unwanted attention or your magic reverberates to other targets affecting them as well, GM’s choice.’ What do you think I’m gonna do?
Jack: I think you’re gonna make the dragon whack someone really hard. 
Austin: Oh, I’m- I’m gonna make the dragon whack someone real hard. [light laugh] So, what’s-
Keith: Who gets whacked?
Jack: Like, a plus 4. 
Austin: We’ll get to roll in a second. 
Jack: A plus 4 dice hard.
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: I mean, this is the thing about bard magic.Like-
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: [stammers] -it- This is what it does. 
Austin: It does do this. Let’s resolve uh- Lord Ephrim and Throndir, and then we’ll talk. So- so Adaire, make sure you get that plus one- another plus 1d4 [light laugh] on damage. 
Janine: Uh hm. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: Uh, Fe- Uh, sorry. Ephrim and Throndir.
Dre: I should be closer. 
Austin: Because?
Dre: Because then I- I can add- I do more damage up close. 
Austin: Oh, weird. 
Dre: Actually. Because I have my- my gun lets me roll Hack and Slash with DEX.
Austin: Ohhh right. 
Dre: I can use my vampire powers to do extra d4. 
Austin: Ok. 
Dre: And if [Kodiak**] can be helping me, and I add extra damage because of him as well.  
                        ** Recording sounds cut off. [Kodiak] is assumed here.
Austin: Um, do you want to have been on the back of Fero? You got no benefit from being back here at this point. 
Dre: Um, I mean how quickly can I move up there. 
Austin: It’ll be a turn. You’re pretty far away. 
Dre: Ok. Um...
Austin: Um… do you want to like, take a shot and move this turn? And then-
Dre: Yeah, sure. Sure. 
Austin: -get up close next turn?
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: I see what you mean though. I- Looking at your stats, that is true. 
Dre: Let me just um… I’m just gonna try and do Trick Shot. 
Austin: Ok. 
Dre: Because I- I want to try and like, if I can like, blind this thing in one eye. 
Austin: Ooo, ok, good call. That’s a Trick Shot. 
Dre: Um, so do I need to choose to use this hold before time?
Austin: Yeah. 
Dre: Ok. I’m gonna go ahead and- Hm, I’m gonna go ahead and just use my two hold. 
Austin: Ok. 
Dre: So, it’s 2d6 plus three. 
Austin: Hell yeah. That is a… nine.
Dre: Hey, I’m glad I used it. 
Austin: Yeah, that would have been rough. That would have been a six without that. Um, so ‘on a seven to nine, you reduce your AIM by one, you spend some time lining up the shot, or you get into a vulnerable position, or you sacrifice or endanger something important.’ 
Dre: Um… I mean, it probably makes sense that I’m getting into a vulnerable position. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Dre: Since I’m modin- I’m moving closer. 
Austin: Yeah, totally. So, but that is gonna actually-
Dre: Oh, actually, you choose one. 
Austin: Oh, I do choose one. That is the one.
Dre: Ok. 
Austin: So, and we’ll- we will- You kind of like, climb up the side of this thing using some ropes, using- I don’t- I don’t know. You climb the side of this fucking building. You’ve like, found a jumping pattern that you can move up. You’re a vampire; you do all sorts of wild vampire shit. I’ve seen those movies. I’ve seen uh…. What are they called?
Keith: Blade? 
Dre: Uh… [Austin stammers] Are you- are you about to say Twilight? Is that what you meant to say?
Austin: No, the other one. But they do that, too, in Twilight I guess. 
Janine: Underworld?
Dre: Oh. Uh, Underworld, yeah. 
Austin: Underworld. Yeah, but Blade also. They- All them vamp- all them vampires do shit. 
Keith: Yeah, everyone knows how vampires do. 
Austin: Everyone know how vampires do. [Dre laughs] Uh-
Art: With jumping. 
Austin: Yeah. And so you like- 
Dre: Specifically. 
Austin: -you’re able to get up there, and you pull off this shot just as this dragon is about to roar and put some really bad- some real bad dragon breath out there, which we’ll resolve in a moment. Um, but you’ll have a chance to-
Keith: Bad like smells? Or bad like fire?
Austin: It does smell. It does smell bad. I don’t know how though. Um… like uh-
Keith: Sulfur?
Austin: It’s not like sulfur. It’s like, copper?
Keith: Hm. 
Dre: Hm. 
Austin: Uh, Ephrim.
Sylvia: Right, I’m gonna do… I’m gonna, you know- I’m far away, but I might as well still lose some HP forever. 
Austin: Uh huh. [Keith laughs] 
Sylvia: I’m gonna use my Burning Brand. 
Austin: Ok. 
Dre: Fuck yeah. 
Austin: Have we ever seen you do a ran-
Sylvia: We’ve seen-
Austin: Have we ever seen you do a ranged Burning Brand before?
Sylvia: Uh, I think the like, first arc of Winter-
Austin: Ok. Ok. 
Sylvia: -I did a ranged one. 
Austin: Hell yeah. 
Sylvia: But I can’t remember - Yeah. 
Austin: Give me the roll. Constitution. 
Sylvia: That’s a ten. 
Austin: Hell yeah. So, you get-
Sylvia: Oh, and I didn’t use my plus one on that either actually. 
Austin: Nice. Nice. 
Sylvia: Um, so I get two tags for my Burning Brand. I’m going to pick the ‘thrown’ tag. 
Austin: Ok. 
Sylvia: Um, actually this is a quick question. 
Austin: I could go with the far tag here probably, right?
Sylvia: Would far be better than that?
Austin: Yeah, I think so. 
Sylvia: Ok. I’ll go with the ‘far’ tag then. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: And I’m going to take plus one damage. 
Austin: Ok. Are you gonna use this thing also? And also, make sure you lose that 1 HP permanently. 
Sylvia: Yep. Do that real quick.
Austin: Cause you’re using the Heat and the Dark here, right?
Sylvia: Yeah, I am. 
Austin: Yeah, ok. Jesus Christ. 
Sylvia: I have to. I- I- [Austin sighs] Um, yeah. I’ll- I’ll Volley now, which I- because I do with my brand I do with intelligence. 
Austin: Ok. 
Sylvia: Thankfully. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: And I’ll- I’ll use my hold on that one. 
Austin: 2d6 plus three is an eight only. Geez. 
Sylvia: Yeah. You know. 
Austin: Alright, so with Volley, you do your damage, but with a seven to nine, ‘you either have to move to get the shot placing you in danger, you take what you can get minus 1d6 damage, or you have to take several shots reducing your ammo by one.’ I don’t know how that works with Burning Brand, do you?
Sylvia: Uh, I imagine it would just use another use of it since I have-
Austin: Yeah, how many uses do you get?
Sylvia: -three of ‘em. 
Austin: Ok. Ok. 
Sylvia: Uh, three. Yeah. 
Austin: So, yeah. It would use a second use. 
Sylvia: [exhales] If I take what I can get, there’s a chance that I just don’t do anything-
Austin: There is that chance. 
Sylvia: -cause I- my damage is a d6. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: Um… I guess I have to move to get the shot. 
Austin: Do you follow after Throndir? [Austin and Keith laugh] 
Sylvia: Uh, yeah…. Nah, no. I shouldn’t do that. I’ll take what I can get with this one, I think. 
Austin: Ok. Ok. You’re not gonna reduce your- your usage. 
Sylvia: I’m not gonna reduce my usage, no. 
Austin: Ok. 
Sylvia: Because if I get- run out of this, I have to summon… another one. 
Keith: Sorry, what does taking what you can get do?
Austin: Less damage which could erase their total damage. Yeah.
Sylvia: Minus 1d6 damage. Yeah.
Keith: Oh, got it. 
Austin: Alright, so go ahead and um- and uh- 1d6 minus 1d6, right?
Sylvia: Ok. Yeah. Um, I guess I’ll just click damage twice and we’ll-
Austin: Yeah, do that. That was-
Sylvia: Ah, great. 
Austin: That was- Oh, wow. 
Sylvia: I rolled a two and then a three. 
Austin: So, no damage. [light laugh] 
Keith: Damn. 
Sylvia: Aw, man. I had a… cool weapon.
Keith: You only lost that HP forever though.
Sylvia: That’s fine. [Austin laughs] 
Dre: Does it do anything different since it’s Heat and the Dark flame?
Austin: If it- if that second roll hadn’t done it, yes. But the- that’s just raw- that’s just like, the numbers don’t add up to more than one. 
Dre: Gotcha. 
Austin: You should have- If you hit this thing with the Heat and the Dark, it definitely would do damage. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, but yeah I think in fact, you are just like, unable to- You tell me. Like, do you have an idea for why you miss here?
Sylvia: So, yeah.
Austin: What- Also, what’s it look like?
Sylvia: Well, two- Yeah, so I am a big fan of when people do the motion for a bow and arrow-
Austin: Me, too. 
Sylvia: -but it doesn’t really appear until they’re in the middle of it. 
Austin: Yeah, that’s sick. 
Sylvia: So, it’s that. 
Austin: Ok. 
Sylvia: Um, and I think what happens is just like, this big like Heat and the Dark arrow, but it like, fizzles right before it hits it this time. 
Austin: Yeahhhh. It just doesn’t have the range almost, you know?
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, so ugh. That’s rough. 
Keith: Probably cause you haven’t used a ranged Burning Brand in fifteen years. 
Austin: You gotta practice, yeah. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: [light laugh] You gotta practice and also hope it doesn’t consume your body and your soul. So-
Sylvia:  One of those things is already happening. 
Austin: Everyone who is up on top of this building fighting this dragon, uh it has reared back. It’s still like, surrounded by this- by Fero- or like not surrounded by- like, pinned by, but it opens its mouth as Fero kind of tries to squeeze and keep it pinned. 
[0:30:00]
And it gets off this blast of breath. This like, crackling red- It’s like what if light- red lightning could also be dripping with blood. So, it’s like, imagine chain lightning in a video game, but like, as the lightning comes out, it’s like, spattering blood on the ground. And the blood is corrosive, and this is- and smells like iron. Or copper rather, not iron. Smells like copper. I need everyone who is on this roof to make a Defy Danger check. Probably Defy Danger DEX to not be hit by this. Oh, that’s a five. 
Keith: Mine was a three. 
Austin: That’s a three. Adaire. [laughs] 
Janine: I got a thirteen. [laughs] 
[crosstalking]
Keith: Holy moly. 
Janine: I got out of the way.
Austin: Adaire and Hella- Um, and Throndir- Ok, so Adaire, you’re completely safe. Throndir and Hella, you will need to make a choice here. Um, [thinking noise] ba-ba-ba I think you… will… Let me see here. This is the ‘worst outcome, hard bargain, ugly choice.’ You can dodge. You can dodge this, but it means actually putting so much distance between you and the dragon that you won’t be able to hit it next turn. Or you could, Throndir, cause you have a ranged weapon. 
Dre: Mm. 
Austin: But you will have to get out of melee range to avoid this. 
Ali: [overlapped] Um, that’s ok. 
Austin: Probably it’s like, diving down to a lower level or something, you know?
Ali: Yeah, I was gonna Dead Eyes next turn, so I think that this is actually a good- Like, Hella jumping back from the fire.
Austin: Yeah, yeah. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Ali: And kind of getting herself together so she can stare at this dragon- 
Austin: Good call. 
Ali: -menacingly. [laughing]
Austin: Great, and then Throndir, you-
Dre: I’ll also- Yeah, I’ll back out. 
Austin: Ok. Fero and um- and Hadrian. Let’s do Fero first. [typing] Um, have to look at this number again. 
Dre: [quietly] Offa. 
Austin: Jesus Christ. It’s not good. [light laugh] That is nineteen damage, Fero. 
Keith: I use Shed. 
Austin: Yeah, I bet. [laughs] Which does what?
Keith: I take no damage. When I take damage while shapeshift, I revert back to my natural form to negate all damage. 
Austin: There you go. 
Keith: So, I basically like, yeah- the- the- I emerge from the skin of this creature, [Austin makes uncomfortable noise] and it disappears, and I pop back.
Austin: I feel like we didn't-
Keith: I guess I get blown back. 
Austin: I feel like we didn’t use to be this gross. Uh-
Keith: [laughs] People seem to like it. 
Austin: Apparently. Hadrian?
Dre: We’ve improved a lot. 
Austin: Hadrian, you take eighteen- op, sorry. Not eighteen. Seventeen damage as this-
Ali: How much damage-
Art: These numbers aren’t getting any lower. 
Austin: No. 
Art: I should just take one of these. 
Austin: These numbers are gonna stay like this. 
Art: And then start Bloody Aegis-ing, right?
Austin: It’s up to you. 
Ali: Can everyone in the chat just say how much HP they have-
Keith: Twenty. 
Ali: -by the way, just so everybody knows?
Dre: Twenty-two. 
Ali: That’s not the chat. [Austin laughs] 
Dre: Oh, sorry. 
Art: Alright, I’ll take it.
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Dre: Oh boy, Hadrian. 
Austin: Hadrian-
Keith: Um-
Austin: Fwoof, I’m gonna go over these numbers. Adaire has sixteen of sixteen. Hella has twenty-six of twenty-six. Ephrim has sixteen of sixteen. Uh, Fero has twenty of twenty. Lem has eighteen of eighteen. Hadrian has seven of twenty-four.
Keith: Yo, get into the sanctuary maybe. [Austin laughs] 
Janine: That’s what it’s there for. 
Art: No, I can-
Austin: Can soak.
Art: I can shrug off damage. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Just didn’t want to this time? 
Art: I just should take one first.
Keith: Got it. 
Austin: It lowers-
Ali: Ok. 
Art: Cause I’m getting- It’s- it lowers my stats. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: Mm. 
Art: You know, the only hit point that matters is the last one. 
Austin: That’s what they say. You only do two- two days, right? [Keith laughs] 
Ali: True. 
Keith: You’re o- 
Art: Yeah, you only get- you only get hurt- you only get to take two points of damage. The first one and the last one. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Keith: You’re only hurt when you’re dead. 
Austin: Uh huh. [Austin and Keith laugh] That’s what they say in tabletop role playing games. 
Art: So, I’m interested in stabbing this thing when it’s done. 
Austin: Oh, and Throndir has twenty-two. I missed that cause it wasn’t in the cool box. Twenty-two of twenty-two, I’m guessing, Throndir. 
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: Ok. 
Dre: There. There’s your cool box.
Austin: Thank you. 
Keith: Wow, nice. 
Austin: Um, wait. So, what were you saying Hadrian? You’re interested in stabbing this thing.
Art: Whenever it’s convenient. 
Austin: Now is the time. I want to do the re- Like, you- you took that fucking hit on the chin, you should get to do a thing. Give me that Hack and Slash. 
Art: I’m not-
Austin: Did you use that hold already? Didn’t need it. Or you did. I mean, you didn’t need it, but it did spend it again automatically. You got a ten unless you spent that hold in which case you got an eleven.
Art: I will not spend that hold, but I will keep that in mind. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Art: Will it- will it use on damage?
Austin:  You cannot use hold on damage.
Art: Alright, so I don’t have to worry about it here. 
Austin: No. 
Art: Um, I’m gonna- I’m gonna do an extra 1d6 again. 
Austin: Alright. 
Art: Even though I think I’ve only ever rolled one on that d6. 
Austin: Uh huh. [Ali makes small uncomfortable noise] Give me the roll. [shouting] Yo!!!
Keith: Yo, fourteen. 
Ali: Wow. 
Sylvia: Holy shit. 
Dre: [laughing] Yo. 
Jack: Hadrian has arrived. 
Austin: Hadrian. 
Ali: [whispering] But you’re exposed. 
Austin: Tell me what happens- Oh, you are exposed. Let me roll this damage. Tell me what happens with this damage, but also one second- Let me do the damage to you so that you can fuckin’ soak it. 
Art: Oh, I already know how I’m gonna do it. It’s gonna be great. 
Austin: Jesus Christ. It’s maximum damage back to you. 
Ali: Holy strong boy.
Austin: [laughing] So, it is- it is uh, twenty-one damage to you. 
Art: Well, you know what’d be cool? If that resulted in no damage, but a scar. Scarred.. 
Austin: That- Ok, one, yes. [Ali and Janine laugh] And I need you to describe what it looks like when Hadrian kills the Advocate. [Ali and Jack gasp]
Sylvia: Damn!
Austin: Fourteen un-
Art: I mean I-
Austin: Fourteen- Like, Hadrian’s sword goes through all armor. It’s the best sword there is. 
Art: I think it’s the- I think it’s taking the damage from the breath weapon. I think Hadrian was just right in front of the Advocate’s mouth. 
Austin: Right. 
Art: And I was just like, ‘o...k’ [Austin laughs] And just sort of like, [Art and Austin laugh] you know, got blown back. You know, it hurt-
Austin: It hurt a lot, presumably. 
Art: And it was like- yeah, and then just like, ran into the- the lightning blood. [Austin blows out air] And that’s what the other dam- that’s what the twelve- twenty-one other damage was. 
Austin: Yeah. [Dre laughs] 
Art: And-
Austin: I think-
Art: And just as- But like, it’s- When you’re breathing blood lightning, you’re- that’s the weakest part of the face. 
Austin: [laughs] It is. Um, and do you just like, with your glowing star sword, just like ‘bop’, right in the top of the head? Like, what is the play?
Art: Um, I mean, I guess keep- Give me a- give me a- just a brief sense- How big is this head compared to Hadrian’s body?
Austin: [sighs] It’s bigger than your body is, for sure. 
Art: Alright, I think- I think Hadrian like, honest to goodness like, disappears into the… into the mouth for a second. 
Austin: Ugh. [Ali makes uncomfortable noise] 
Art: And then like, you see the- the star sword sort of like-
Austin: Yo. [light laugh] 
Art: Yeah, I’m gonna- If you- if you don’t want to hear the rest of this, just like, tap that plus fifteen seconds-
Austin: Uh huh. 
Art: -on your podcast app right now, but like, sort of comes out the back of the- the back of the mouth.
Janine: Does it do that thing in an anime where like, an energy weapon has been contained by something fairly concrete looking, and there’s a moment of like, stillness and then it’s just like, light cracking through-
Austin: Oh yeah. 
Janine: -and like, it just kind of like, explodes out or some shit like that?
Art: Yeah, absolutely. I was thinking a little more like gritty and like, ‘oh, it’s sort of like a pez dispenser now.’ [Janine laughs] 
Austin: Ugh! [Keith laughs] 
Ali: Mm. 
Sylvia: Oh man. 
Austin: Let’s go high fantasy instead of low fantasy. Let’s go-
Art: Sure, yeah. 
Austin: Um, Jesus. 
Keith: Everyone knows pez dispenser is low fantasy. 
Austin: [laughs] Of course. Uh, in the chat, Sylvia[1] says ‘Finally we have achieved the heavy metal album cover aesthetic.’ [Ali laughs] It’s true. It’s damn true. Hell yeah. 
Jack: Hi, John Darnielle.
Keith: We killed this thing before I even got a second turn. 
Austin: Y’all- Seven people is a lot of people. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: And also a sword that ignores armor is very strong. [light laugh] And also, Adaire is a monster.  
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: I want to note the- the other people- the retinue; not here. I know other people came, I forget who they are cause they didn’t- they weren’t in this fight. 
Jack: Uklan Tel was like, ‘what if you brought an orc army?’ [Dre laughs] And we were just like, ‘Hadrian is going to stab it in the mouth from the mouth.’ [Ali, Austin, and Dre laugh] 
Austin: From in- Ughhh.
Dre: Through the mouth. 
Art: Hadrian’s gonna run straight at the mouth. 
Austin: So, you have it. Um-
Jack: Wait, wait wait. Wait, wait. Hang on. Wait a second. 
Austin: One second. 
Jack: Hadrian gets scarred.
Austin: Yeah, so I think- My thought on these scars is that they are a lot like Samot’s. Like, that same sort of like, almost like… marbled- Like, um- Ok, you know who I’m actually thinking of? Is the- this is a weird one. What was the James Bond villain with diamonds in his face? Zao. Do you know Zao? It’s- Zao is from Die Another Day. Z-A-O. 
Dre: Oh. 
Austin: Great concept. Great evil bullshit movie concept is uh, diamonds exploded and scarred my face, and now I look hot. Um, [light laugh] because I have diamonds in my face. 
Art: Yeah, cause that’s an important thing to remember is that this is like, a temporary thing. So like, for a while, it’s bad, but in a wh- in a little bit, we’re all gonna have to agree that Hadrian’s hot again. [Austin laughs] It’s just- That’s the rules. 
Dre: Well, I mean if you’re looking at this. It looks kind of hot. 
Austin: [louder] That’s what I’m sayin’!
Art: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, and I think it’s that. Because that’s very much what I have in mind with Samot with the star stuff, except it’s this like, deeper red, for the next little bit. I think it’ll- it’ll heal differently cause you’re not gonna fill it with this red lightning, but like, Hadrian comes out of that mouth, and his face is glowing red. And he has like-
Art: He’s gonna lie down for a while. 
Keith: Damn, he’s a sith. 
Austin: And also- Well, yeah. And also his sword is covered in evil dragon blood which turns it from yellow to red. No, I don’t think that part’s true. But it’s sick. And actually, Hadrian, you’re the one- Cause you come out of it facing west, and it’s the first time in this moment, you’ve at- been at a height where you can look to the west from the Mark of the Erasure and see the damage this thing has already caused. Um, it… it’s like, gone. There isn’t a Velas anymore. [pauses] The tower of Eventide has sunk into the sea. Ordenna has fractured into a dozen smaller islands. 
Keith: Ordenna has?
Austin: The island of Ordenna. Yeah. To the west. To the south, Twinbrook, Old Man’s Chin… it’s ashes. Like, this place was your home. This was your neighborhood. 
Art: Yeah. 
Austin: And this thing you’ve killed- you’ve already killed… destroyed it utterly. And not even out any sort of particular malice. Just because it preferred it not to be. 
Art: Yeah, I think this is devastating for- for Hadrian. I think um- I think he like, literally can’t… Between the intense damage and the experience of going through a dragon’s mouth and then seeing that the city that he grew up in and tended to the people of and cared deeply about doesn’t exist anymore. I think Hadrian just like- I don’t know. Just fuckin’ what- what are we physically standing on? Just like, a roof?
Austin: The rubble of a- of a roof. The side of a tower. It’s-
Art: I think he just like, collap- Like, I think it takes Hadrian a long time here. 
Austin: I mean, if we want to be as like, bullshit on our shit as possible like, you know, this is a tower that’s carved with the visages of all of the gods, you know? Um, that has statues in the side of it. And they’re like, laying on the ground as if they’re on, you know, an altar or on a- in a- on a like, a gravestone or something, right?
Art: Sure. Like if we want to go just full… Hadrian in a- the fetal position in the busted face of a Samothes statue-
Austin: Yeah. [Ali laughs softly] 
Art:  -we can do it. Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah, uh huh. [exhales] 
Ali: I was- I was gonna say that like, when Hadrian comes out of the other side of the dragon, then Hella was like, gonna grab him to hug him. 
Austin: That can happen first. 
Ali: Um, yeah. 
Art: Yeah. [Austin and Ali laugh quietly] 
Austin: [sighs] What is the respon- Like, that’s it. It’s quiet, but it’s not that absent quiet. It’s not that the world has- the you know, everything’s been removed, it’s just a quiet night. And it’s probably you know… almost morning. 
Keith: M-O-U-R-N-I-N-G?
Austin: Yeah. Uh huh. Almost Mourning, my favorite Twilight Mirage character. That’s when Morning’s Observation gets a Larry. [Keith and Jack laugh] 
Austin: Whose name is Almost Mourning. 
Jack: And they get on so well. 
Austin: [laughs] They get on. They’re great. 
Keith: It’s hard not to get on with your- with your own Larry. 
Austin: Mm. 
Jack: It’s hard- I mean, that’s kind of the thing, right? [laughs] 
Austin: So, what is- what’s- There’s this corpse here.
Jack: [quietly] Can we- 
Austin: There is this whole place.
Jack: Huh. 
Keith: I know some people were promised claws and meat. [Austin laughs] 
Jack: Yeah, I was gonna say like- [Dre laughs] Do we take a trophy?
Austin: Oh, you gotta. 
Janine: Is it safe?
Dre: I mean is this- Is this just fuckin’ Vanilla WoW where we walk through the streets of [Ali laughs] fuckin’ Ironstorm or whatever it’s called with the dragon head?
Austin: Yeah. 
Dre: [overlapped] Just trippin’ that weird cutscene. 
Janine: Also, is that a little creepy since this was- this was a friend's skeleton before it was this thing?
Keith: Maybe we should take-
Janine: Is that a bit grim? 
Keith: -back some of its bones to bury back in the ground. 
Jack: To be buried. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Dre: Yeah.
Janine: Yeah. 
Jack: And also the head. 
Keith: We obviously can’t take the whole thing. 
Austin: It’ll take some trips, but you’ll get it back. 
Jack: Actually, yeah. Like, maybe we do actually just try and get the skeleton. Like- like-
Austin: Load it into a cart or something. 
Jack: Get the whole thing.
Dre: Yeah. 
Jack: Yeah, I’m thinking of the like, hydra in Dragon’s Dogma. 
Austin: Yeah. [louder] Yeah, oh that’s good. 
Jack: Which, for people who haven’t played it, is this- this amazing visual of a- an escort mission where the thing you’re escorting is like, four huge carts. One of which has the head of a hydra on- is the side of- size of like, a van.
Austin: It’s great. 
Sylvia: Yep. 
Dre: Geez. 
Austin: It’s early, too. It’s so good. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: And yeah, you can find-
Keith: That game gets very cool very fast. 
Austin: It does. You will find another cart. You can find a cart in this tower. In this massive, mega-city. What is the- I- I really just want to zoom in on like, individual emotional response to this. We have Hadrian. We have Hella giving Hadrian a hug. Hella, is there anything else?
Ali: [exhales] Um… I don’t know. I think when she realizes why Hadrian’s upset, she just kneels next to him, right?
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Um… and they have that shared moment cause it sucks. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Um- 
Art: Yeah, both our homes are gone. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: We- Another idea- we could- we could bury the bones where um-
[0:45:00]
Austin: True. 
Keith: - Samol’s orb was. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Or really a lot of different places here.
Austin: Right. Samol lived here for years, right?
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: So, there is a way in which this is-
Keith: This might even be a better place to do it. 
Austin: Possible. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: I kind of like that. 
Jack: I mean, I’d be up for that. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: Yeah. me too. 
Jack: And in that- and in that sense, I suppose we could see Lem looking around for like, tools to start digging. And like-
Keith: Oh my god. 
Jack: -finding a-
Keith: I’m- I turn into the vole. [Jack and Austin laugh quietly] 
Sylvia: God damnit. 
Austin: God damnit. [Ali laughs] So, you’re burying Samol. 
Keith: I’ve started digging, yeah. 
Austin: Uh huh. Good, yeah.
Art: Really leaning into the fan service late in the season. Bringing the vole back. 
Austin: Uh huh. [laughs] 
Keith: I wouldn't've- I wouldn’t have thought of it, but Austin mentioned it earlier. 
Austin: I did. It’s true. It’s my fault.
Keith: At Ba- Baron’s uh- Baron’s Gate.
Austin: Yeah. Adaire? Ephrim? Throndir?
Sylvia: Ephrim expected to be happier about it. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: But when that arrow sort of disappeared and then all of a sudden it was done without him… having really done much-
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: -he’s just like, ‘That’s not right. That’s not how this was supposed to go.’
Austin: Huh. 
Sylvia: So, he’s like, putting on a smile for everybody… but he’s kinda like, ‘well, why didn’t I do it?”
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: ‘This is my story.’ Cause that’s the type of person he is. 
Austin: Yeah, it sure is. 
Dre: Mm. 
Austin: Throndir. 
Dre: I mean I think it’s- it’s similar to Ephrim, but it’s different. Again it’s that feeling of Throndir of like, ‘Ok, like… Hadrian and Hella are like, the important people here.’
Keith: Thanks. 
Dre: And it just like reinforces to him that- [a few people laugh lightly] Well… [Austin sighs] It just reinforces to him, it’s like, ‘Ok, both of these people need to be around.’
Austin: [sighs] Right. 
Janine: I mean the thing with Ad- like, Adaire’s from Velas, too. [light laugh]
Austin: Yeah… yeah. 
Janine: Uh, but like, definitely does not have that- that same attachment.
Austin: Mm. 
Janine: I think to me that image is like, Hadrian is- is sort of kneeling and processing that. And Hella is- is kind of like- probably like, has her arm around him- or what was the- that was the kind of image? 
Ali: Yeah, I think she’s-
Janine: Like, sort of being with him?
Ali: -trying to console him at this point. Um-
Janine: For me, my image of Adaire then is that she’s sort of crouched with like, her elbows resting on her knees in front the big dragon thing. Like, with Barbelo beside her. And she’s maybe like- I think she’s got one hand kind of on Barbelo’s scruff, like givin’ him a scratch, but she’s kind of looking at her- looking over her shoulder at Velas. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: It’s a very indirect look. 
Austin: Yeah. Uh, Lem, we got you burying Samol, but I don’t know if there was more there. 
Jack: Um, I think it’s the- I think we see Lem like, climbing up on the wreckage of the tower and just sort of like, sitting with his back to uh- like, a row of sculptures or like a- a facade or something. And I think he’s facing away from the direction of the kind of ruination of- out towards to west. 
Austin: Uh hm. Yeah. Um, real quick. Art, take one more damage because um, I forgot to roll that plus 1d4 that Lem gave the dragon. [everyone laughs]
Janine: [quietly] Great, it’s Lem.
Jack: Is this just a claw slipping and falling- it’s just-
Austin: [laughing] Yeah, uh huh. It just burned a little deeper than you thought maybe. So, I think as things calm down and you know, everyone’s kind of getting their stuff ready and getting back- getting- You know, I’m- Maybe you’ve interrogated Uklan Tel and maybe you’ve just explored this huge place long enough, but you eventually find the place that Tabard mentioned which is the place where you will be able to put yourself into the body of a- of a Tabard-style pala-din. Which is to say- to be a hundred percent clear, those are the pala-din who have like- They’re like, terminators. They’re like- like, soft flesh, but underneath are made of- of kind of stone. Of the- of the marble. The living marble. Don’t ask me about the science, you know? 
It’s not my speciality. But you find this place. I think it’s probably towards the bottom. There’s all these places that- that the first crew never went to- all these different like, tower levels. And I think it’s one of those is one of the ones where you have to go. And it’s- I don’t know if you remember this, but when you walk inside of these- these um, structures, gravity sort of shifts. And you- while you’re looking in, you’re looking at like, yeah the floor is the- is the wall, but as you walk in, it kind of shifts like a video game with gravity stuff goin’ on, and suddenly you’re just like, on the floor like normal. Who do you- Do you just go alone? Do you bring someone to do this? [Ali exhales] Are you even sure yet? 
Ali: [laughs] I think that’s the thing. I think it’s like, Hella going alone, but then she just is standing outside of the door. [laughs] And the party’s far away being like, what’s up? [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah. ‘Come on, Hella. Get your terminator body.’ [Austin and Ali laugh] Let’s go. Is anyone there to encourage Hella here?
Janine: I think that Adaire would probably… see the hesitation and extremely not understand it because I imagine her coming up like, very [laughs] you know, I- I would never normally use the word puppy-ish to describe Adaire’s behavior, but- [Ali, Austin, and Janine laugh] I think- I think like-
Austin: Never? Never?
Janine: Never. Not puppy-ish. Like-
Austin: Ok. 
Janine: Like, I would go for-
Austin: Doggish. 
Janine: More like, fox-like, you know?
Austin: Ok, yeah. 
Ali: Mm. 
Janine: I- I tend to imagine her more like a cat.
Austin: Yes. Fair.
Janine: In general. But I imagine this moment like- it’s a very triumphant moment of like, ‘Wow, that was way easier than I thought it would be.’ 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: ‘Cool. That was cool. Everyone did great. Good job. Grab a gatorade. Let’s go. [Austin laughs] You’ve got that body thing.’
Austin: ‘Get your new body.’ 
Janine: ‘Let’s check this body stuff out. We’re gonna sort this Hella thing out. [Austin groans a sigh] Everything is great. I got a dog. Life is fantastic.’
Austin: [finishes laughing] As a reminder, Adaire, you’re bond with Hella is ‘Hella has seen me at my best and my worst. I would- I will not let her doubt my devotion.’  And Hella, yours with Adaire is ‘If I’m in the last hours of my life, I cannot close the distance Adaire’s kept between us. But I do- but I do want her to know how much she means to me.’ So, settin’ the stage. [Ali laughs] Just- just for me and the audience. 
Ali: Um, yeah. I think if… Adaire approaches, Hella’s just immediately like, 
Ali (as Hella): I can’t do this. I’m gonna throw up. [laughs] 
Janine (as Adaire): Why? Is it like a- I mean, the room’s very disorienting so that’s fair. [Ali laughs; Austin makes a small ‘mm’ noise]
Ali (as Hella): I just- I don't know. [sighs] I- I don’t know about this. Um, that it’s the right call. Uh… I don’t know. I don’t know with a body that’s made out of rocks. Um… I- [exhales a laugh] What if it is- what if it’s not like, cool rock? Like smooth? And my bones are weird? 
Janine (as Adaire): I mean- Ok, well…
Ali (as Hella): What- what if I- what if I get sick, and you can’t give me some of the medicine that you make because I’m- I’m a- I know there’s-
Janine (as Adaire): Hella….
Ali (as Hella): I don’t know what I would take. [laughs lightly] 
Janine (as Adaire): Hella, you might be better off honestly. [Janine and Austin laugh] 
Ali (as Hella): Don’t-
Janine (as Adaire): In a world where you can’t take the medicine that I make? That’s not a bad- [Austin laughs lightly] You know that stuff’s junk, right? Like it’s junk. [Keith laughs hard, followed by Ali] 
Keith: [laughing while shouting] Adaire’s selling people fake medicine?!
Austin: Oh, did you not know?
Janine: [laughs while shouting] Keith!
Austin: What?!
Keith: I really didn’t know this. 
Austin: Keith!
Keith: What? [Janine and Ali laugh]
Austin: Adaire’s entire concept is snake-oil salesmen.
Keith: I thought that that was done. [Ali laughs] I didn’t know that like- like-
[crosstalking]
Austin: She didn’t become a doctor! She lived in Auba- I mean-
Keith: She was still selling stuff. I just-
Janine: You never truly leave your past behind.
Keith: I just didn’t realize that she was still like- Like, we’ve been- we’ve all been busy. Like, I didn‘t know you had time to sell fake medicine to your friend. [Ali and Austin laugh]
Janine: No. I didn’t- I didn’t sell it. I didn’t sell it. I made some for- for the clinic in case people needed to sleep. It helped- it does legitimately help people sleep because it’s booze and junk. Um-
Keith: What is the junk? What’s in the junk?
Janine: [laughing] You know, whatever’s around. You go from place to place.
Austin: Sawdust. 
Janine: You can’t have a consistent ingredient list. [Austin laughs]
Keith: Whatever’s around? Like- like sometimes it’s mint, and sometimes it’s cumin, and sometimes it’s like, acid?! Like, what?
Austin: Fero, you really- you actually really fucked up Adaire’s whole thing when you got rid of the beach because [laughing] sand is a very effective weight. [Keith and Janine laugh] 
Keith: Oh yeah. When people drink sand, they really think that medicine is happening. [Austin groans]
Janine: It’s true. 
Austin: Tastes earthy. [laughs]
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Anyway.
Keith: Each grit is a little bit of medicine. [Ali and Austin laugh; Janine exhales]
Austin: [amused] A spoonful of sand helps the medicine go down!
Janine (as Adaire): I mean, ok. So, [exhales] is that like- [exhales] Is that really the stuff you’re worried about? Because all that stuff kind of… [exhales] If the thing you’re worried about is like, if your rock body gets sick, maybe we can’t fix it- well, we can’t fix your current body super well. That’s- that’s like, the thing, right?
Ali (as Hella): [quietly] Yeah, I guess so. [sighs]
Janine (as Adaire): So, it’s- it’s not like a- it’s not like a la- Well, you still don’t sound jazzed about this. 
Ali (as Hella): I- I’m just supposed to go in there and like, be different, but be… [exhales] It just doesn’t seem… How many chances does one fucking person get, Adaire?
Janine (as Adaire): Uhhh, my answer to this is gonna be complicated. [Ali and Keith laugh] 
Ali (as Hella): Well, that’s what I mean. It’s complicated cause you know me. 
Janine (as Adaire): Yeah, but like, I know you. That’s- that part’s not gonna ch- [exhales] I mean, I guess I don’t really know how this stuff works, but like, you’re probably still mostly gonna be you. That’s not very reassuring. [Ali laughs] 
Ali (as Hella): [quietly] Mostly. [exhales] I-
Janine (as Adaire): Like, you’ll have different arms and stuff, but…
Ali (as Hella): I’m very used to these arms. 
Janine (as Adaire): You might like your new ones more?
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, I might. I might like them more. That’s right. You’re right.
Janine (as Adaire): You don’t sound- You still don’t sound jazzed. [Ali/Hella breathes deeply in and out] I don’t- I don’t know that I blame you honestly. 
Ali (as Hella): If it was you, would you do it?
Janine (as Adaire): Yeah. 
Ali (as Hella): Oh. 
Janine (as Adaire): I mean… [Ali and Janine laugh lightly] I’ve done-
Ali (as Hella): You wouldn’t even think about it?
Janine (as Adaire): I’ve done way stupider things to stay alive, Hella. 
Ali (as Hella): [draws out words] I know. [Austin laughs]  I have, too. [Janine and Ali laugh] [Ali sighs] I just want to just think. I mean, I don’t wanna- I obviously don’t want to, but- but it just seems like- [sighs] I’m- I’m gonna stay here and just talk to people who all do the thing that I can’t do? [exhales] 
Janine (as Adaire): What?
Ali (as Hella): Well like, first there was Calhoun. Then it was that weird sword. Not even just Calhoun; how many people have I killed in my life? Like, and I’m just gonna walk into this room, and it’s gonna be fine for me because it’s fine for me.
Janine (as Adaire): [tone lowering] Oh…
Ali (as Hella): Right?
Janine (as Adaire): So, you… Ohhh. I thought you were just like… freaked out because… the- the rock people kind of suck and are confusing.
Ali (as Hella): Well, it’s both. Because they- [Ali laughs] 
Janine (as Adaire): This is like, a guilt thing. 
Ali (as Hella): Well, it’s-
Janine (as Adaire): No, I get it. I- I got you. Um… I mean [exhales] I don’t kn- [exhales] I don’t want to tell you something just… to convince you to believe the thing I believe. I think if you feel bad about this, then there’s a reason you feel bad about it, and those feelings are real. [pauses] And I don’t want to… pretend that I- I can say a thing that makes those feelings go away. You’ve killed a lot of people. [Ali/Hella whines lightly] And a lot of them were like, dead in a way that… they definitely don’t get to come back in a- in a rock body. But at the same time… I mean… you… help people now. Like, you do stuff. You… [quietly] I mean, everyone does stuff. That’s a stupid thing to say. [louder again] You know what I mean though. Like, you’re not… Your presence in the world makes a material difference for other people. And… the people that you’ve killed can’t come back, and they don’t get the second chances that- that you get. And… that sucks, but [exhales] if you’re gone, other people aren’t even gonna get a first chance. If you hadn’t showed up in that cult room... the thing- remember that? I-
Ali (as Hella): I have not forgotten the cult room. [Janine laughs lightly]
Janine (as Adaire): I don’t- I couldn’t have done- I don’t care how much weird god shit happened, I would not have been able to kill that dude. 
Ali (as Hella): Well- [sighs] 
Janine (as Adaire): How-
Ali (as Hella): You don’t know that. You’ve been doing great.
Janine (as Adaire) I don’t think Red Jack could kill that… That dude could’ve caved my head in with a sneeze. [Janine and Keith laugh] 
Ali (as Hella): Mm. 
Janine (as Adaire): I’m very realistic about my physical viability in certain types of fights. 
Ali (as Hella): [sighs] I guess I’m not… Yeah, ok. You’re right. I know you’re right. You’re right about everything. 
Janine (as Adaire): I- No, I’m extremely not right about everything, and you shouldn’t just know that I’m right. I wan- [exhales] I mean, this isn’t- It’s not like you’re stepping into the body right now, right? Like- we’re-
[1:00:00]
Ali (as Hella): I think so. I think this is… I think this is it. 
Janine (as Adaire): Oh. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, I’m just- I’m just gonna go in there, so… It’s your last chance to talk to- [laughs] 
Ali: I was gonna say Hella Varal one-’o’- [laughs] point one. 
Austin: [laughing] Point ‘o’. Yeah, uh huh. 
Ali: She doesn’t know- [laughing] She’s never been on AOL. She doesn’t know. [Keith, Janine, Ali, and Austin laugh] 
Keith: Hella doesn’t know what beta means. [Austin and Ali laugh] 
Sylvia: Not in that way. 
Austin: Mmm. [Dre laughs] Mmm. 
Ali: [excitedly] Ooo. Um, god. [clears throat]
Ali (as Hella): This is the last time I’m gonna be this version of me. 
Janine (as Adaire): Are you sure?
Ali (as Hella): What do you mean am I sure? That’s the whole thing, isn’t it?
Janine (as Adaire): Yeah, I mean- Yeah. No, I mean like, are you sure you want to do this? I don’t… I don’t… I don’t want you to do this and then... [exhales] I know you trust me, and you really shouldn’t sometimes. And I don’t want you to trust me over yourself on this. You’re- I just think you’re important. 
Ali (as Hella): [exhales] Why wouldn’t I trust you… if that’s what you are saying?
Janine (as Adaire): I mean cause there were times where I measured your importance in crackers that I brought you back from a restaurant to try and make you feel less shitty about me flying away in the night. That’s one example. 
Ali (as Hella): They were good crackers. 
Janine (as Adaire): Then there was that time I made you… um, keep Sol busy while I poisoned his tea. And like, I just kind of like, brought you along cause I needed you to be able to like, handle it. 
Ali (as Hella): I was glad to be there. 
Janine (as Adaire): [exhales] Ok. 
Ali (as Hella): Ok. I guess that’s it. 
Janine (as Adaire): [pauses] Wait. Um… [Ali and Janine laugh lightly] 
Austin: Is that… Adaire or is that Janine?
Janine: [laughing] That was- that was both. 
Austin: Ok. 
Janine: Out of- out of the moment here, is Hella going to walk in there and then come out a pala-din basically?
Austin: She’s gonna come out looking like Hella Varal, but with a pala-din in- like, she’s gonna be what Tabard is- or was, you know? Tabard, I think, at this point, you can see uh- Tabard at this point has been beaten up enough times that like, that like, parts of his body are just revealing like, marble statue inside of him. But like, that is not a problem for him. He’s not like, eager to repair that in some way. It doesn’t make him less functioning. Like, he is at peace at this point with being pala-din. Um, or with being what- what you know, we call pala-din. 
In retrospect, I bet they find a new word for themselves at some point, um because pala- or they- they reclaim pala-din in a very specific way about service and like, service to a community and service to others, not service to whatever fuckin’ god made- made you as a servant. Regardless, the point is based on what we’ve said, as established, you’re gonna go in there. There’s gonna be some sort of divine machinery, ya know? Um, some artificer divine… or- or artificer mundane helped build this machine. Which is like, a combination of technology and - and magic. There is enough raw material, right? That’s already stored here from ages ago. 
You will probably walk past a bunch of regular pala-din body; bodies that are like, deactivated or have not been like, turned on so to speak. And then you will insert whatever the plate is that Tabard gave you that is like, ‘here is how you make sure one of these is one of my types of bodies’, but you can only do it with special material that is only available in City of First Light and at the- this tower. Samot’s old tower, and then the- whatever this ritual looks like- looks like happens. I don’t think we see it on screen, and then she’s gonna come back. 
And she’s going to be- I mean, we’re gonna roll some dice just to see how well this goes, but I don’t think there’s a world in which you- I’ve given you this. I’ve said that this is the fact, and so I’m not gonna ever- You could roll a two on this somehow, and you would still come back Hella Varal in this Tabard-style pala-din body. So, the answer is she’s gonna come out a pala-din. [light laugh] 
Janine: Ok. Um, I was mostly just asking cause I wanted to- to like, think of the good way to close this out before this happens. 
Austin: Uh hm.
Janine: Um, I think the thing that Adaire does when Hella is like, ‘ok…’ I think she reaches out and takes Hella’s hands, and then sort of kisses one side of knuckles and kisses the other side of knuckles. And then gives her hands a little like… squee- I’m trying to think of like, the best way to describe it. But like, an encouraging squeeze. Like a ‘you got this’ kind of squeeze. [Austin laughs] 
Austin: ‘Go out there champ. You got this.’ [Ali and Janine laugh]
Janine: ‘You got this. Go become the best stone person you can be.’
Austin: ‘Go get stoned.’ [laughs] 
Ali: Is this gloves on or off?
Janine: Um, I think Adaire fully has- you know, she’s been gloves on, sleeves down.
Ali: Then I think Hella like, when Adaire takes uh, Hella’s hands in hers, like runs her thumb over Adaire’s knuckles. Um, and is like, 
Ali (as Hella): Do you want me to just not ask about it?
Janine (as Adaire): No, I mean it’s just a long story.
Ali (as Hella): Um… well, give me like, five minutes and then we’ll have as much time as we need to talk about it. [Janine laughs] 
Janine (as Adaire): That sounds good. 
Ali (as Hella): Um, cool. 
Ali: I think that she- [laughs] 
Austin: ‘Cool.’ [Ali laughs harder] [Janine starts laughing] Uh huh. 
Ali: Um… yeah, I think that she like, pushes some of Adaire’s hair behind her ear, and then turns around and walks into her- her weird uh, new body room. 
Austin: Uh hm. And you know, I think it’s one of those things where like, it automatically lights up with torchlight, and there is- I mean, so part of- part of this that’s fun is uh, Adelaide has to help you with this. [Ali laughs] Um, that as- again as established, the thing was like, Adelaide knows how to move- can move you over into this. But there’s like, a lot of question marks on what that looks like. I don’t know if you have ideas about what that looks like or what you think is interesting about this visually. Like, are you seated somewhere? Is it two different rooms? Is it like a… Are you laying down on something? Like, what is the visual language we want to- we want to bring to bear here? I know that’s a big question.
Ali: [laughing] I know. 
Austin: But I didn’t really know until to- until this moment that you were for sure doing it-
Ali: Right. 
Austin: -so it was hard for me to be like-
Ali: Yeah, uh huh. Fair. Um… god. I’m trying to think. Like, what is happ- What happens with Hella’s old body? Like-
Austin: I think it- I don’t think it goes anywhere.
Ali: I guess it gets- transforms because she’s still like…
Austin: I mean I don’t- I don’t- In my mind, your soul is moving effectively, right?
Ali: Right. Yeah. Jesus. [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah. I don’t know. Listen, there are- One Hella was already killed in this place from when Fantasmo destroyed an entire dimension that had a different Hella in it. 
Ali: Uh hm. 
Austin: So, it’s really just addin’ to the pile. [Ali and Austin laugh] 
Ali: Just pilin’ up.
Keith: A Hella Varal Remembrance Museum. 
Austin: Uh huh. Does anyone else have ideas about what this could look like?
Keith: Uh, the second one stays alive and follows her around until it dies. 
Austin: Right. Until it dies. Right. 
Ali: Mm. 
Austin: That’s great. That’s so good. No. [Keith, Ali, Dre, and Austin laugh] 
Janine: I was trying to find a video of this- I think it was a toy from the nineties that- It’s like a- it was like a thing with like, a mold that’s like a person, and then you like, dumped stuff in the top. And then it would like- you’d like, spin it, and it would harden. And it’s not a good idea. I’m not saying it cause it’s a good idea. [laughing] I was just trying to find the video and couldn’t. 
Austin: Yikes. Yeah. 
Dre: That just makes me think of the weird monster oven thing that was that. 
Austin: Yeah, uh, what was that called? Creepy- Creepy Crawlies? Creepy-
Dre: Crawlers.
Janine: No, Creepy Crawlies was the one you could eat. 
Austin: Wait, could you eat Creepy Crawlers?
Janine: I think- I think once- I think Creepy Crawlers-
Keith: Are you thinking of floam?
Austin: You could not eat floam. 
Keith: Are you sure?
[crosstalking]
Janine: I think there’s a- There’s like-
Austin: I mean-
Keith: I ate a lot of floam.
Janine: Ugh… like the boy equivalent of the-
Dre: It’s definitely Creepy Crawlers. Not sure if you can eat it. 
Austin: I don’t think you can eat Creepy Crawlers. They do look like jelly candy. 
[crosstalking]
Dre: Yeah, it does say molding oven. [Austin laughs]
Janine: I think there was one that was like- 
Ali: I always go to Utena, but in the last episode of Utena there’s this character-
Austin: Uh hm.
Ali: -Anthy, who like- She gets like, locked into this thing, and it’s like this big door with like, roses and stuff on it. But basically like, her body gets locked in there. And I’m thinking if it’s like, soul transferring, what if it’s like, Hella needing to die in her current body-
Austin: Right. 
Ali: And then being in Adularia again. And then Adaire’s like- I mean… [laughs] Jesus Christ! 
Austin: Wooowwww. Wowww.
Ali: Perfect.
Janine: Wow. 
Ali: Um, Adelaide- [laughs] 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: -is like, sitting in the throne and like, ‘oh, there’s a new dead person here,’ and then you know, smirks and is like, ‘hey, I got you.’ Um-
Austin: Right, so is this- You’re saying then like, it is almost just a matter of like, Hella- This is the scariest version of this. [Ali laughs] Is that like, you can feel it in your body that you’re dying, right? Like, you know that you’ve had this fatigue. You know that you’ve had this like- it’s- it’s an illness that is slowly killing you. And there’s a degree to which you have to like, lean into it and hope that Adelaide catches you on the other side. 
Janine: I have an idea for the image of this actually. 
Austin: Sure. 
Janine: In like- for Adelaide transferring a soul that she’s not supposed to hold basically.
Austin: Uh hm. 
Janine: What if it’s like, a string of pearls that’s untied on one end? 
Austin: Oo, that’s good. 
Janine: So, she has to- it’s one of those things like, she’s moving it. There are bits- You know, there’s pearls falling. 
Austin: Right. 
Janine: It needs- She has to do it quickly, etcetera. Somethin’ like that. [inaudible word]
Austin: Yeah. Yeah, it’s like, there’s a risk at which- But also she needs to actually untie it on both ends so that they slip onto another line basically. Right? And then the thing that the Heat and the Dark ends up taking in Hella’s place is the original like, thread that the pearls were- were on, you know. Like, it still takes that original thread. It’s just that the pearls which are Hella go onto this other new necklace, you know? Um, I think that’s really pretty. Actually, is it like- [exhales] What’s this actually like for you, Hella? Like, are you in Adularia? Adularia? Like, is this a- Are you able to talk to Adelaide, I guess, while this is happening?
Ali: I think so. I mean I think that it’s like- I think that it’s horrible initially when I have to do this thing and like, accept that this is what I’m doing. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: But like, it’s going through Adularia. Like, the front door, right? [laughs] 
Austin: Right. Right, right, right. 
Ali: And it’s like, Adelaide having someone who died. It’s like, ‘Oh hey. [more familiar] Oh, hey.’
Austin: Right, actually that’s diff- and in that way maybe it’s like- It does feel different to you in some way, right? Because you didn’t show up in the throne room. You show up in line. [light laugh] You know? There was no roll here, you know what I mean?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: This is not the thing. But she’s there for you, and I think- I mean like, do you watch her as she’s doing this pearl stuff? Whe- where?
Ali: I think so. 
Austin: Where’s this at?
Ali: I think I’m like, in front of the throne. 
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: And I think I’m maybe kneeling for- [laughs] for professionalism? I don’t know. 
Austin: For effect. Like- like kneeling like a knight or kneeling like a sick person? [light laugh] Kneeling on one knee like, with a bended head? Like, what’s the- [Ali laughs] 
Ali: I think- I think on one knee. 
Austin: Yeah. Ok, so then I think she’s sitting in her throne doing this thing with the pearls. And I think there’s this shot that is like, the- the pearls- If you were a cinematographer, I would be asking you to try to shoot the pearls with- at the same angle and with the same lighting that we shot Hella’s knuckles when Adaire kissed them. [Ali laughs] Right? Um, and she’s holding them like that. And I think- [exhales] I think Adelaide looks to you and is like, 
Austin (as Adelaide): Hella, you know… that I’m glad that Adaire is with you.
Austin: And she slides another pearl. 
Ali (as Hella): Are you sure?
Austin: [exhales] She smirks and says, 
Austin (as Adelaide): Have I ever not been sure?
Ali (as Hella): We- well, it was like a- just a couple days ago that we um… and it just seems….
Austin (as Adelaide): And I have not taken back a single word of that. Both of these things can be true. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah?
Austin (as Adelaide): I’m the Queen of Death. I learned a long time ago that people can hold more than one love in their heart. Besides, she’s useful. 
Ali (as Hella): Don’t… [Ali and Janine laugh] 
Austin (as Adelaide): I mean that in a good way. 
Ali (as Hella): She is. 
Austin: And she slides another pearl. [Janine laughs] 
Ali (as Hella): She’s great. 
Austin (as Adelaide): And you are, too. I heard the conversation. I know that this is hard for you, and it’s hard for her. 
Austin: And she slides another pearl.
Austin (as Adelaide): And it’s hard for me. And I think that is why I don’t mind so much. We’re all very useful, and this has hurt us all very much. 
Austin: And she slides another pearl.
Ali (as Hella): I’ll miss you still. 
Austin: I think she like, narrows her eyes a little bit, and she says, 
Austin (as Adelaide): Miss me? I’m not going anywhere. I’m not letting you go. 
Ali (as Hella): No. No, I just- You know. 
Austin (as Adelaide): Hella Varal. [Ali exhales a small laugh] You will be a better knight for me than ever. You’ve seen the kingdom we’re building here. 
[1:15:00]
Austin (as Adelaide, cont.): And if you have more reason to carry that mission forward above? If you have more support? If you have someone else to remind you that you do good work, all the better for everyone. 
Ali: [laughs and sighs] I’m just thinking back to when Hella said that Adelaide was her boss a bunch. 
Austin: Uh huh. Yep. 
Ali: And she is. [Austin laughs] Um.. [laughs] 
Austin: Oh, it’s great. 
Ali: I- [laughs] I think Hella’s like, blushing at this point cause how do you not?
Austin: Uh hm. How do you not? [laughs lightly]
Ali: [laughing] And I think that she says, 
Ali (as Hella): I just meant that if I- I could be here more, I would be. But… having a um… a very direct understanding of the situation is helpful. 
Austin: She nods and says, 
Austin (as Adelaide): [exhales] You’ve never made a habit of apologizing to me, Hella. You don’t need to for not visiting as much as we both wish you could. I value the time we have together. [breathes deeply in and out] We have come a long way.
Austin: Um, I think she like, absent-mindedly reaches up to her neck, but also like… I think she- she notices- I think she just says this, 
Austin (as Adelaide): When we met and I said ‘we’, I meant ‘me’. Now I mean ‘us’. 
Austin: And she slides the last pearl onto the string. 
Ali: Does Hella like, wear it? Like, what is- [laughing]
Austin: Oh, yeah. Oh, I think so. I think it’s like- she like, steps off the throne and like, attaches this like- like- I think she like, you know, moves her hands back behind your- your neck, behind your hair and like, attaches the clasps. Um, and I think it does something really cool because we don’t talk enough about the fact that your um- your outfit can glow. 
Ali: [laughs] It does. 
Austin: You have the gold. And I think what it does- when she clasps the- you know, she connects the clasps in the back and puts it on you as you kneel, there is like, a flash of that- of the kind of golden light from your outfit, and it like- they have a pearlescence cause they’re pearls, but that pearlescence instead of being kind of blue and purple and like- you know, the way pearlescence is, it’s like gold and orange. Um, and it’s more opalescent than it is- like, there’s some green in there maybe, but like, it’s more opalescent than pearlescent. This is- this is your new- [light laugh] This is your new, weird pearl of- of life. Like, I don’t fuckin’ know how souls work here, but apparently this is the metaphor we’ve gone with. [Ali laughs] And so here we are. And it looks sick. 
Ali: I bet. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: I think when- I think when she puts the necklace on-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: -Hella like, kisses her in that moment- 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: -and says, 
Ali (as Hella): I really do love you. Thank you for giving me another chance. 
Austin (as Adelaide): I love you, too. And that means I did not have a choice. 
Austin: And kisses you back. And she says, 
Austin (as Adelaide): I think the first few days will be rough. If you need anything, just ask.
Austin: And then kisses you again, and when your eyes open, you're back. 
Ali: Cool. [laughs] 
Austin: Uh hm. Fwoof. 
Ali: Nice. [Austin, Janine, and Ali laugh] Uh, cool.
Austin: Alright, well great. 
Janine: Wife and kids and dog. 
Ali: ‘Hey Adaire, I got permission.’ [Janine, Ali, and Austin laugh] 
Austin: You know, it’s acknowledgment more than permission, right?
Ali: [laughing] ‘Hey, Adaire, my boss told me-’ [Janine laughs] 
Austin: ‘My- my- [laughs] That we were allowed, Ma’am.’ 
Janine: I was literally thinking this is on some level now like a sports anime [Ali laughs] where you have the star athlete, and instead of having a-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Janine: -an arc where the star athlete is like, dating some cool rival athlete slash coach-
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: -or having the arc where the athlete is dating like a- like a tsundere cheerleader, it’s both. 
Ali: Uh hm. 
Austin: It’s both. It’s both. Uh hm. 
Ali: Uh hm. We did that. 
Austin: God. Honest- Yeah. [Ali laughs] Honestly, the world is now lucky that- Hieron is lucky that Hella Varal is now in a cool robot body because it- we’ve proven that if she had actually died, the combined like, force of Adelaide and Adaire would have burned the whole fucking thing down. [Ali and Janine laugh] That would have been it. [Ali sighs] Alright. 
Ali: So, what’s my new body like?
Austin: Um, I think it feels weird, Hella. [light laugh]
Ali: Ooo, I bet. 
Austin: I mean, I think this whole process is a thing that’s gonna feel super, super, super strange, and I think it’s like- So, for me thinking about this- I obviously think a lot about this in terms of disability, also in terms of chronic illness, also in terms of like, transhumanism, but I think that one of the things that’s a throughline when I read people who use prosthetics- when I read their accounts of having prosthetics- when I- you know, when I talk to people about- about what their life has been like living with disabilities or living in a society that does not account for their- their bodies being different, um one of the big things is- or really the other one here is like, people who are injured and have their bodies change the way that they work is um- more so than people born with disabilities specifically- is like, ‘hey, it is true that technologies exist to change the way my body works, and for the better and it’s rad, but I’m fighting with my prosthetic as often as it is helping me sometimes, at least when I first adjust to it.’ 
And I think that it’s an important thing here, and it’s also important to just like, recognize that the physicality of this is- is distinct. Like, it is you, but this is not the body you’ve had your whole life. And that can be euphoric when it- when it’s- when it fits right, and when you get used to it, and if it’s something you really want. Or it can be really, really tough to adjust to that. In the same way that anyone who goes through- not anyone, but a lot of folks who go through surgery or a lot of different types end up coming out and being like, ‘Oo, I- This- Is this- I feel weird.’ The least- the most privileged version of this is I’ve been having dentist stuff done for the last year, and my mouth has not felt right for a year, right? There are holes in it the way that there shouldn’t be. It’s weird. And it doesn’t feel good to eat. It hasn’t felt good to eat in a long time. And that’s a very small version of this, but I do think that that idea of like, recognizing the physicality and the difference there is important. All of which is to say, could you roll constitution for me? [Ali laughs] 2d6 plus CON. 
Ali: Sure. 
Austin: Which is ‘when a session begins- At the start of a session- -or during this- this particular um, procedure, during this ritual, ‘roll constitution. On a ten or more-’ Op, so… here’s the thing that happens. You’re gonna do this and you have every debility on the- on the sheet. All of your- you have- All of those are marked. Physical and mental because I think that we should not like, think that there’s like, a sharp binary between the two. 
Ali: Oh, no, no, no. Yeah, yeah. No.
Austin: Right? So, they’re all- All those debilities are there, but ‘roll 2d6 plus CON. On a ten plus, you can remove two of them for the remainder of the session or one permanently and describe what it feels like getting control of that aspect of your body- or coming to terms with it or coming into a familiarity with it. Um, and seven to nine, you can remove two for the session, and there’s not a permanent one that- that changes. And on a six or below, remove one from this session.’ There's not like a har- I’m not making a hard move here if you fail this. It’s just like, you’re just not coming into it the way you hoped you would, you know?
Ali: Yeah. Um, and I’m rolling constitution with the sick modifier. I’m gonna- I’ve been sick for a while. I’m gonna roll with that adjusted. 
Austin: Oh, right. You were sick already. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Right, yeah. Then yes. 2d6- Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Ali: Yeah, if it was anything else but sick, I would of been- [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah, totally. [light laugh] Totally. So, just flat 2d6 then. 
Ali: And that’s a four. 
Austin: Yikes, and that’s a four. 
Ali: Great. 
Austin: So, pick one of these, and ou can- you can remove it and tell me how you’re struggling. In fact, I mean what’s this feel like for you as you wake back up?
Ali: Ok, so my- my choices here are weak, shaky, sick, stunned, confused, and scarred?
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: And I think the one that I’m gonna remove is stunned. 
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: Um, which isn’t like- it- [laughs] it’s funny. It- it brings Hella from a negative one intelligence to a zero.
Austin: Uh hm.
Ali: And it’s not like, the most useful one, but I do think that like, in- in having something- in having a conversation that was able to ground her before doing this, she comes out of the process like, ‘oh, fuck. I don’t know what any of this is,’ but at least isn’t like, stunned. [laughs]  You know?
Austin: Right. Right. 
Ali: Like it’s like-
Austin: Totally. 
Ali: Like, I knew what I was getting into. I made this choice. I- I did it myself, and I feel horrible. 
Austin: Right. But it worked.
Ali: [laughing] But at least I am not surprised in the way that-
Austin: Right. 
Ali: Yeah, yeah. 
Austin: ‘I didn’t come out and now I’m a tree person. I didn’t come out and like-and the world is on fire, ’
Ali: [laughing] Yeah. 
Austin: -’and it turned out that I traveled-’ you know, or whatever, right? Like-
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: So, um,.. cool. Do you go back outside? How long does this take? It probably takes more than five minutes? 
Ali: [laughing] It takes a little bit, I think. I think that like, I mean there’s even- I’m walking through this whole like, weird thing-
Austin: Yeah, yeah. 
Ali: -and then figuring out like, ‘oh, I have to go into the death trap?’
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: ‘Have to close this door and a bunch of swords are gonna close on me?’ 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: And then it’s being in Adularia for a bit cause that’s a whole thing. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: But I think it’s like a- like a- Adaire’s probably waiting for a little bit, if she waits.
Austin: You wait, Adaire?
Janine: Yeah, I mean I have a dog now, so I can keep myself busy. 
Austin: That’s true. That’s true. [Ali and Dre laugh] 
Ali: Thank you. Thank you, Adaire. 
Janine: I mean I’m actually- The thing I was thinking more is that like, Adaire is probably worried in that way of like, ‘should I get someone? Should I just wait this out? [Austin laughs] She said to just wait.’ And probably just like, is fussing with Barbelo to like, deal with that nervous energy more than anything else. 
Ali: I think it even takes longer cause even just- She wakes up by herself and then has to walk out. [laughs] 
Austin: Right. 
Ali: It’s tough. It’s tough. Um, she’s able to do it, but it’s not easy or um, you know. I think she comes out like, sweaty and like, tired looking. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Um… but she’s back, and she looks like Hella. 
[crosstalking] 
Janine: How did-
Austin: What’s Adaire’s response? Go ahead.
Janine: [laughing] I don’t know- I don’t know how to respond because like- It’s one of those things where… I actually don’t know like, you know, I knew what to expect. I don’t know that Adaire knew what to expect going into that. Like, I don’t know that she knew… that what- what kind of Hella would be coming out. Um-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Janine: Even- Like, especially because her last encounter with quote-unquote stone- a stone person was like, a gargoy- like, a gargoyle. 
Austin: Yeah, fair.
Janine: It was like a gargoyle. [laughing] So…
Austin: It was like a gargoyle. Not wrong. 
Janine: I think it was one of those things of she would- she would never say like, ‘so, are you gonna come out a gargoyle?’ [Ali and Keith laugh hard] But she would- [laughs] But you know, she would have like- she would quietly have a range of expectations of like-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Janine: -’ok, so she might come out looking like Hella. And she might come out looking like a gargoyle. And I need to be cool.’ So, I think when Hella comes out, there’s a moment of like… ‘well, the thing probably happened because it took time, but also just like… is it- are we…? You good?’
Ali: Hella- Hella’s not good. Like, shaky, weak, sick, confused, and scared- scarred is what she is right now. [Austin exhales]
Janine: Ok.
Ali: Um, so-
Janine: That's- that’s probably gonna change Adaire’s reaction somewhat then. Uh… I think she probably stops um… [laughing] like, petting her dog. [Ali laughs] Uh, and like, hurries over to try and… help Hella. This is probably not a- not the kind of- If she was considering her movements more- if she was considering her reaction more, she probably wouldn’t be like, I’m gonna go offer this pala-din something to lean, being me.’ Um, but she is- You know, it’s Hella. And Hella is- is- Hella’s having a rough time. Hella needs a hand. 
Ali: Um, yeah. I think she is- she like, puts her… her weight on Adaire, but then like, realizes that she’s doing it, and realizes- being like, I don’t know. I- I think it would be a really real thing to be like, ‘I don’t know if I hurt people.’ Right? Um-
Austin: Yeah. [laughs] Right. 
Ali: But I think that she… She kind of like, accepts Adaire’s help. And says, 
Ali (as Hella): I’m… I’m definitely gonna need some of that junk that you make. [Austin and Janine breath quiet laughs] 
Janine (as Adaire): Uh…. I mean… Again I don’t- it’s not even helpful for the stuff it’s supposed to be helpful for, but you can give it a shot. It’s really great um, with ice? [Austin laughs] And… and like, orange juice. It’s fantastic.
Austin: It’s- it’s vodka. Yeah. [Ali and Janine laughs]
Janine: Sometimes. 
Austin: Right. 
Janine: The current batch is closer to vodka than anything else. [laughs] 
Austin: And then the group begins to head back, I guess, right? Um, does anyone else here like- just kind of like… 
[1:30:00]
Austin (cont.): There probably just isn’t a moment to be like, ‘you good, Hella?’ [Austin and Ali laughs lightly] as individuals, I’m guessing?
Sylvia: Yeah… 
Keith: If-
Sylvia: Also I don’t know- Like, Ephrim- At least in Ephrim’s case, he does not know how to broach that subject yet. 
Austin: Sure. 
Dre: God, big same. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: Sure. 
Keith: I mean, do we even know for sure it happened? Like-
Austin: I- I guess not. Like-
Keith: Fero wasn’t there, and she looks the same. 
Ali: I think that like, if you were… if you were- if somebody is like, ‘hey I’m gonna be right back’, and then they come back with a fever… [laughs] 
Dre: Hmm. 
Keith: I guess. But I feel like I was like, tr- like, burying the dragon. 
Austin: Right, but the thing that- That’s the question there is like, is there at least a moment where someone looks over and is like, ‘Wait, is Hella…. Is this- Is Hella dying? Like, what’s happening? Why does she look so bad?’ And then Adaire gives a look like, ‘it’s fine’. Ya know?
Dre: Actually, maybe it’s Throndir? As the other person who has like, died and come back as something physiologically different.
Austin: Mm. Uh hm. And also since we had- already had that conversation between-
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: -Hella and- and Throndir.
Janine: How- how do vampires interact with pala-din?
Austin: It’s emotion, so they can eat on them.
Janine: Ok. Ok. 
Austin: They can feed on them. 
Janine: Alright. 
Austin: Feed on them. Better than eat on them, I think- [Keith and Ali laugh] as a- as a phrase- as far as phrases go. [laughs] Um, but don’t eat Hella, please. 
Dre: I won’t. 
Keith: You say that now, but there’s no bells around. 
Dre: It’s true. 
Austin: It’s true. 
Dre: I had a- [exhales] I don’t know if Throndir has like a- like a thing to say, but it’s more or less like- like, coming to check on her being like, 
Dre (as Throndir): Do you feel ok? Like, is there anything I can get you? Or do for you?
Ali (as Hella): I- I’m good, dude. I- I appreciate it. 
Dre (as Throndir): Ok. Like… uh…. I know it’s not the same, but I think I might be the only person who can like, kind of approximate what’s going on, so if you do need anything…
Ali (as Hella): Oh, really? Wait, what’s happening to me? [laughs, Dre makes noise] Was it- What happened to you? [Austin and Janine laugh] 
Dre (as Throndir): I mean I told you I- I… [laughing] I met your nice girlfriend, and then I came back as a vampire. I know it’s not the same. Alright, I’m gonna go-
Ali (as Hella): Right, but were you like-?
Dre (as Throndir): I’m gonna go. [Austin and Dre laugh] 
Ali (as Hella): No, but wait. [everyone laughs]
Austin: [groans and laughs] The most honest. This is good. Go. Keep goin’. [Ali finishes laughing]
Ali (as Hella): Wha- di- were you like, ok? Cause I don’t know that I’m ok. 
Dre (as Throndir): Oh. Ok. I… Ok. Ok. Um…
Ali (as Hella): Can you still drink the same stuff like it- Can I taste things the same? I don’t even know. 
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah, so I can still taste and drink things. I just don’t need to. But I don’t know if those are the same rules for you. 
Ali (as Hella): [sighs] Who knows that?
Dre (as Throndir): I mean have you tried- Have you eaten anything?
Ali (as Hella): No. 
Dre (as Throndir): Do you want- All I- all I got is like, this water. I bet-
Austin: No, you got a- you got a thirteen on your quartermaster-
Dre: Oh, that’s true. 
Austin: -roll before. So, I feel like you have whatever Hella’s favorite food is, you have like, a little secret supply that you put aside. 
Dre: And also what- what’s her favorite wine pairing with it? [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Oh my god. 
Austin: Hella?
Ali: Um… 
Austin: [laughing] What’s your favorite road food?
Ali: Jesus. Um-
Austin: Mine’s mozzarella sticks. 
Ali: Ooo. 
Dre: Good choice. 
Keith: [shouting] Mozzarella sticks don’t travel. 
Ali: That’s not a road food, yeah.
Keith: That’s bad road food. 
Austin: No, it’s like, a road trip food. Like, you stop at a diner-
Keith: Road- Ok, you stop at a-
Austin: Yeah. [Ali laughs] 
Keith: But we’re not at a diner, we’re on the road. 
Janine: Yeah, you- I’m sorry rolling a thirteen in Dungeon World, doesn’t mean pocket diner. [Janine, Keith, and Ali laugh] Pretty sure.
Austin: You have like, camp set up. You have a fire goin’. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: You walked- He walked into one of these like, markets from a different, parallel dimension and picked up some mozzarella. [Dre sighs delight]
Janine: There’s a new kind of bush, and the bush just grows mozzarella sticks. 
Keith: It gets these-
Dre: No, I know what it is. 
Keith: It gets these breaded cheese sticks. You have to freeze them. [Austin laughs] Freezing food? That’s crazy. 
Dre: Um, there’s a little- there’s a little brown paper bag, and it says ‘To Aunt Hella.’ And it’s Benjamin packed her her favorite sandwich. [Austin inhales a gasp]
Austin: Aww.
Ali: Wow. Um, yeah. I was gonna say Hella has been canonly a big fan of bread and small hand breads. [laughs] 
Austin: True. 
Dre: There you go. 
Ali: I was thinking it was like- like one of those bread puffs that you can get with like, meat and potatoes and stuff inside. 
Austin: Ooo. 
Dre: Ooo. 
Ali: Yeah. Which is also a sandwich thing.
Keith: Is hand bread a- a category of bread? [Ali laughs] 
Austin: [quietly and slowly] Hand-bread. 
Keith: Or is it just any kind of bread made small?
Ali: It’s any kind of bread made small. It’s a bread that is bi- a handheld- like, a handheld pie. Like a-
Keith: Right, like a- Yeah.
Ali: Sometimes you get a loaf of bread, and it’s big. And sometimes it’s a little circle, and it fits in your hand.
Keith: Right. 
Austin: A hand bread. 
Ali: Um, yeah. 
Keith: Sometimes you have a sourdough loaf. Sometimes you have a sourdough marble. [Ali laughs] 
Ali: Um, I think Hella like, takes the bag, and she opens it. And she like- [laughs] She like, holds up one half of it and like, just puts her tongue on the- the edge of like, where the meat is just to be like, ‘ok, let me see.’ And I guess she- Do pala-din people taste things? They have those like, flavor chips, Austin.
Austin: ...What’s up? [Ali laughs] 
Ali: Pala-din’s bodies have like, those flavor chips. Can she eat food?
Austin: Wait, what flavor chips? What?
Ali: They were eating the like, pantone fucking- [laughs] 
Austin: Oh yeah. But- oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keith: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Austin: So- so, yes. That is what traditional pala-din bodies have, but remember Tabard was like, alive for years and years and years and didn’t know he was a pala-din.
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: And so I think like, that is part of the magic of this. And I don’t think you’re digesting anything. I think it’s fake. Like, I think you’re like- Like, you don’t- I don’t think you need to eat to live, at this- We got a third one everybody! [Ali laughs and claps] Congratulations!
Dre: Yay!
Ali: I think that she- She goes to taste it and realizes that she can and eats it like, ravenously. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: Like, just as quick as you could eat a sandwich. Like, very [Keith laughs] Scooby-Doo. [Ali and Austin laugh] Just in there. [Austin makes cartoon gulping noise]
Janine:  Do pala-din get hiccups?
Austin: Yes. 
Ali: She’ll deal with that later. [Janine laughs] 
Austin: Um, no. It’s super- Like, this is a- It is- It’s gonna be one of those that’s tough cause like, I don’t want to play like, ‘haha, Hella has a different body’ for pure laughs. 
Ali: Right. No.
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: Or- or as like, ‘ooo, weird alien body. Not like a regular body.’ But also, this is a distinct change in your life, and we should honor that by making sure it’s clear that like, ‘yeah, that-’ I bet- I bet eating feels weird and different. I bet having food in your stomach is different, ya know?
Ali: Right. 
Austin: Like, noticeably. 
Ali: And I also think it’s one of those things where it’s- she’s like, ‘oh, I feel weird. I feel sick. I feel shaky. I must be hungry.’ [laughs] ‘What have I done in the past to fix myself? Oh, eat food? I guess I gotta do that.’
Austin: Right. Right, ‘remember to hydrate, stupid’. Like- [Dre and Janine laugh] ‘It’s three PM. You haven’t eaten yet, and you had like, a sip of coffee. Of course you feel terrible!’ [Ali and Janine laugh] ‘Eat fo- Drink anything else.’ Um, so… you know. You clean the path there and back. You can get back in not that long of time, now that you don’t have to wor- now that you know the path and now that you know that things are safe. What we do get is a shot of the party coming home with some sort of trophy. I don’t know what that trophy is. Is it the claw? Is this the wings?
Sylvia: I- I was gonna suggest the wings. 
Austin: Wings are sick. Yeah. The wings. Um, and remember when I was like- So, what- Two things. One, remember to- Two- two things. One- one, people in the chat in the discord like to emphasize how bad things can go when um, failures snowball in bad ways. Which is true in this game. That’s how Hella died to begin with, right? It just like- ‘this is bad. This is bad. This is the worst.’ I want to point to this as a really good example of how successes can snowball, too. That like, this does not happen- and this goes- kind of speaks to the Throndir stuff, if you do not ace all of those- those Perilous Journey rolls. 
You don’t get the +1 forwards here. You don’t catch it sleeping. And you would have gotten- there would have been an earlier encounter that would have weakened you before you got here and made you probably far less aggressive. So, that’s one. Two is I told you that you would be rewarded for this if you went out in the mid- in the moment and did it. And the answer is- the reason for that is because you will- you will have done it first. You will have been- you will have gotten there by yourselves and have claim to this kill- to having defeating the… the Advocate. Which one, brings- if you have a thing that’s like, ‘bring fame to blank,’ you get that XP. [Jack laughs] Cause you absolutely do. Two is when you get back, you find that Carlay de la Carta has been here. You might remember them as the kind of ninja that works for Ordenna that set the bombs to kill Samot. 
And they arrive to deliver a message and stacks of papers and uh, kind of posters to be put up. And they did this while you were gone offering a bounty of one hundred thousand gold coins to whoever [someone whistles] kills the Advocate. Um, the thing is- the way this was gonna play out per my prep was that the Ordennans were gonna hunt it. And this was like, a way of them like, flexing on everybody. [Janine laughs] Cause like, ‘we’re gonna go fuckin’ kill this dragon, but what we’re gonna say is it’s a- it’s a competition.’ And that didn’t get to happen because you killed it by the time they spread the fucking word. [Ali and Janine laugh] 
Jack: Do we get like, a visual of *her arriving in town to see the wings-
Austin: Uh…
Jack: -with like, a pamphlet and posters?
Austin: Of who? Oh, of Carlay? They- Yeah, so Carlay uses they/them. 
Jack: Oh, sorry. Of them.
Austin: Uh, yeah. They- they- Yeah, totally. I think it’s like, they- it’s like the day that they’re supposed to leave, right? They’re like, ‘alright, I did my- I did the trip. I put up all these posters.’ And in you fucking come with the wings in a cart. [Jack laughs] And like, fuck. 
Janine: Can I wave condescendingly?
Austin: Oh, a hundred percent. With gloves made of the wings. [Austin and Janine laugh] Like, you- [Dre laughs] With like, one of those big num- foam number one fingers. [Austin, Keith, and Ali laugh] Number one dragon slayer is the last- Yeah. 
Janine: Yeah.
Keith: The size of an apartment building. 
Austin: Uh huh. Um, yeah. Uh huh. You get all- Like uh- Hella in the chat- uh, [Ali laughs] Ali, you said ‘wait, did you say wings and a heart because that plays’-
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: You get the whole thing. You- rem- We carved up this fuckin’ dragon. Listen. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: [laughs] Uh, Throndir in the chat says, ‘So, Hadrian, can I borrow like, ten bucks?’ So, this is enough- So, the actual thing here is like, it’s- it’s a lot of gold, but the real thing is- the way it was originally planned or like, the thing is like, ‘oh, whoever kills it, I’ll knight you, basically, and give you a keep.’ A keep is seventy-five thousand gold. Um, which is a lot of money, and yet not the most expensive thing. A castle is two hundred and fifty thousand gold. And then upkeep on this stuff is one percent of the cost, so- Seventy-five thousand is a lot, so I gave you a hundred thousand. Like, a hundred thousand is like, the keep plus the upkeep for a little while, you know? 
Art: Hadrian is a hundred percent going to accept that knighthood in person. 
Austin: Great. 
Keith: Wait, wait. Hold on. Hadrian gets the whole thing?
Janine: [laughs] Mm.
Art: I don’t want any of it. I just want to force the Ordennans to knight me. 
Ali: Mmm. 
Art: You want a keep? Have a keep. I got- I got a house. It’s on the map. 
Sylvia: We- we could knight you. [Janine laughs] 
Keith: On whose authority?
Art: I think I’m already a knight. 
Dre: Are you knighted already? Yeah. 
Art: Well… but they’re like, a different… I don’t know. We can talk about it. 
Janine: We should pick the most embarrassing person for them to knight. A soldier guy isn’t that. It’d be like-
Ali: Lem. 
Janine: -Fero as a fidget spinner dragon. [Ali and Sylvia laugh] 
Austin: Uh, is there anything else? I mean there is, right?
Jack: End of session?
Austin: End of session. But also like… deep breath…. We have to get- Just want like, a couple of quick shots here. You know, people are waiting for you to come back. Word got- you know, word comes back that you’re on your way. That no one got killed. That like, this was an incredible feat. Morale spikes instantly, you know? [exhaled laugh] You killed the thing that was going to end the world. 
Keith: One of them. 
Austin: Well, this is the thing, right? Is that like, how much time did you buy? Like, you- you bought a reasonable- You bought time here, but like-
Keith: More than if we have waited. 
Austin: A hundred percent more than if you’d waited. 
Keith: More than if we hadn’t rolled so well on those travel rolls. 
Austin: Absolutely. But this is not the Heat and the Dark. You didn’t slay ‘nothing’. You know? It’s still out there, and it’s still tearing apart the world. The wounds that were committed to Hieron in the northwest have like, basically won that part of Hieron for the Heat and the Dark. There’s such a great loss there. And it- You still don’t have a solution for what comes next. And so, I think that there is- there’s a lot of joy here.. But there are definitely- there are still some reservations here. But I think your loved ones specifically are like, there at the gates. We get Benjamin and- and Blue J and Emmanuel. Like, this is probably the most triumphant return you’ve ever had to a place. So, that’s- that ain’t bad. Ya know?
Art: But it’s- it’s scarred and broken Hadrian. 
Austin: It is. 
Art: Looked more triumphant. 
Austin: Sure, but your family fuckin’ loves you, right? 
[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” begins playing in the background] 
Austin: And like, runs to you and embraces you. 
Art: Sure, yeah. Yeah, uh huh. But it’s like, the Hadrian wincing at being embraced, I think, is the-
Austin: And Rosana’s very much like, ‘Are you ok?’ And when you say ‘yes’, she goes, 
Austin (as Rosana): You’re gonna heal and look really hot. [Austin, Jack, and Art laugh] 
Art: ‘You should see this James Bond movie.’ 
Austin: [laughing] ‘It’s great. We watched it while you were gone.'
[Music plays out to end]
