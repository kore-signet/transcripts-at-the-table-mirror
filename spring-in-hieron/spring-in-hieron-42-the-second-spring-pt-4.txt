Spring in Hieron 42: The Second Spring Pt. 4
Transcriber: Cole
[Jack de Quidt’s “Under the Boughs” begins playing]
Austin: Five months before the arrival of the Frost Shepherd, the snow elf, Throndir, found himself somewhere new. Lost. But he was not in the overgrown wilderness of the rhizome nor was he wandering the streets of some labyrinthine metropolis. No, he walked between wobbling stacks of books. Collected from every annex and reading room, every single shelf and corner closet floor to this- an empty hall that would soon enough be a new library for all to take advantage of. 
For Throndir though, this had become something else. A place not only to focus his effort on helping the community, but a place to focus at all. His close companion and confidant, Red Jack, had grown distant and cool lately. The oni’s connection with his many past selves growing dimmer in the tangle of this new world. And now, Throndir’s protege, the ranger, Blue J, had announced that they would be leaving to explore the world along with their partner, the young wizard, Benjamin. Working was not only working. It was a distraction. At least, it had been until the sound of the door opening signaled a new arrival. The young oni had come presumably to offer their final goodbye. 
Austin (as Blue J): Hey, Throndir! 
Dre (as Throndir): Hey! 
Austin (as Blue J): Lot of- lot of books... This is- Are these gonna fall?l
Dre (as Throndir): Probably, but it will be fine. 
Austin (as Blue J): Do you need- I mean- I mean... So, I'm leaving tonight. 
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. Yeah. Did you bring your bag? 
Austin (as Blue J): Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got- 
Dre (as Throndir): Let me see it.
Austin (as Blue J): Okay. 
Dre (as Throndir): Let me- let me check here. 
Austin (as Blue J): Here you go. 
Dre (as Throndir): Okay. 
Austin (as Blue J): I got some snacks. 
Dre (as Throndir): Mhm. 
Austin (as Blue J): I have one of those like, powder flares. That way if I get lost, I could shoot that up in the sky. 
Dre (as Throndir): Okay. 
Austin (as Blue J): I got a little map that I bought from one of Adaire’s kids. Do you think it's a good map?
Dre (as Throndir): It's good enough. 
Austin (as Blue J): Alright. I'm ready. I think I’m- 
Dre (as Throndir): You've been ready. You took too long to do this, honestly. 
Austin (as Blue J): I mean there's a lot to do here still, so I felt like it wasn't time yet. But, you know, Benjamin really wanted to go and um…
Dre (as Throndir): It's a new world, and it needs its new Ranger. So, go. 
Austin (as Blue J): Yeah I'm gonna. I'm gonna, but Throndir... This is a lot of books. Let me just stay for a little while and help you out. And then when Benjamin comes knocking, I’ll go. But he's lazy, and it might not be for a while. So, I bet you I can at least get through the A’s. Get those organized. 
Dre (as Throndir): Alright. 
Austin (as Blue J): Alright. 
[music plays out to finish]
Austin: Welcome to Friends at the Table, an actual play podcast focused on a critical world building, smart characterisation, and fun interaction between good friends. I'm your host, Austin Walker. And today we are continuing the epilogue of Hieron by playing The Quiet Year by Avery Alder. Before we get into that though, I briefly want to shout out the Twilight Mirage charity fanzine. ‘It's a Garden’ is what it's called. There are a couple of days left for you to preorder that, and you should because we're getting very close to the goal because it's filled with incredible stuff that you can get a preview of if you go to twitter.com/tm_zine Z-I-N-E. 
Or by going right to the actual funding page. If you go to fundly- F-U-N-D-L-Y dot com- fundly.com/tmzine T-M-Z-I-N-E, you can support ‘It's a Garden,’ a Twilight Mirage charity fanzine. You should support it- again, one, because it's filled with really dope Twilight mirage stuff. There are stickers at certain kind of supporter levels, or giving levels. And the way we're doing it is that, after the printing fees and shipping fees and stuff are paid for, the remaining money is being split between the artists and contributors and editors. And then, the other half is coming to us, and then we're giving all of the Friends at the Table percentage of the raised money to charity. 
We're giving it all to the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, a.k.a. RAICES. Which if you have been following the immigration crisis at the border- if you've been following, you know, kids being put in cages- if you've been following the like, truly horrendous dehumanization of an entire group of people based on the color of their skin and the nation of their origin, I think- I think you can agree that for a show like Twilight Mirage, which was very much about overcoming those sorts of differences, and people dreaming of better worlds, and people reckoning with the fact that they may themselves be caught up in a history of colonization, I think that you could hopefully see the overlap there, and- and go support it. 
Again, one more time, those links. Fundly.com/tmzine to go support it, or you can go to twitter.com/tm_zine to see some of the stuff that's in it and get you hyped up. The stickers are real good. If you want some- if you want a fucking Calciyumm sticker, let me tell you, you can- you can get one by supporting this zine. Alright, everybody. Now, on with the game. It is Autumn, and we... What do we got goin’ on on this screen? Do we wanna quick go over what we got?
Jack: Go on a little journey together? 
Keith: One giant spider, one giant ant, and one headless monster bug.
Austin: Good. That's one thing. Jack, you tell me a thing that's on the screen.
Jack: We have got a... um, a gondola. A silk gondola leading to Alcyon, which is beside a canyon.
Austin: Good. Ali, how about you? What's one thing on the screen? 
Ali: Um… [laughs] We have a bunch of these little forts from the Grey Duke. [overlapped] They’re just like-
Austin: Mhm. And one of them from uh-
Ali: Corsica 
Austin: Or was Corsica, but then it became Adaire.
Janine: Adaire DuCarte’s Union of Solutions? 
Ali: Wow.
Austin: Union of Solutions. 
Keith: Union of Ablutions. 
Jack: Higher- Higher Union of Solutions. Or Union of Higher Solutions or something, right? 
Janine: It was gonna be a Union of Elegant Solutions. But then, I was like, sometimes the solution, you know, isn't elegant. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Right. 
Janine: Sometimes a solution just gets it done. 
Jack: A very inelegant solution. 
Austin: Right. Janine, what is something else on the screen? 
Janine: There's a little fairy circle- like, a mushroom fairy circle. [overlapped] Down in the south.
Austin: There is a mushroom fairy circle. Yeah. 
Jack: Where we found Alyosha. 
Ali: Yeah.
Austin: Alyosha was there. 
Dre: Oh shit. 
Austin: Dre. 
Dre: There's the cool sun from the Raisin Bran box. 
Austin: Okay, but what- Tell me more. [Sylvia and Keith laugh]
Dre: I- I feel like I just painted a picture. I don’t know. [Austin and Dre laugh] I mean literally. There is a sun with sunglasses on, and he's got a big scoop, and it looks like there's Raisin Bran in there. 
Austin: Okay. That's- Yeah, okay. 
Janine: There’s also, though, this-
Dre: There's also lots of other suns of various shapes and sizes and luminescence. 
Austin: No. So, that's only- there's only one sun. Those other things are not suns. 
Dre: Well, what are they? 
Art: Those are the pollen hail. 
Austin: Those are the pollen hail. 
Dre: Oh.
Keith: Yeah. 
Janine: That's also what the orange stuff in the sun scoop is supposed to be. 
Dre: Okay.
Janine: I was trying to make it cute, but then the pollen hail got that color changed on it, [overlapped] and I was too lazy to fix it. 
Austin: I changed the color to make it more like the pollen. I'm sorry. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Dre: Oh, that’s okay. 
Austin: Now it looks like the sun is scooping up fire and raisins. [Dre laughs] 
Janine: I like golden raisins. 
Austin: Golden raisins. Delicious. 
Art: You never see golden Raisin Bran. 
Austin: You know, you never do. You never do. Sylvia[1].
Keith: Well, all the regular raisin money goes into protecting that.
Austin: Right. Big Raisin. 
Sylvia: We've got another Velas that we found. 
Austin: We do have another Velas. We do. Uh, Art, something else on the screen? 
Art: We have Hadrian's beautiful diplomacy stand. 
Austin: We do. 
Sylvia: [laughing] God. 
Austin: It's gorgeous. I think it's gorgeous. 
Art: Diplomacy five cents.
Austin: [laughs] We also have a bed that Alyosha is resting in. A uh- what do you call that? A vein of ore- of special ore. We have a library under construction. We got some sapkin. We got some rabbits. I believe these are rabbits.
Ali: Mhm. 
Austin: Ali, are these red things rabbits? 
Ali: Yes. Yes.
Austin: Awesome. I was pretty sure, but I needed to confirm. We got a… What's the big tree? A Weaver King? God, this sap. 
Keith: Businessman octopus. 
Austin: Uh huh. We got some Grey- Grey Duke troops. We got a canyon. We got some communities. Oh! And we got a book over here What's this? Is this the almanac, Dre? 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: On the left? 
Dre: Uh huh. 
Austin: Okay. And an ugly horse I drew. And the moon. [Sylvia breathes a laugh] And some question marks.
Keith: Did we investigate that horse? 
Austin: No, that horse is just there still. 
Sylvia: Oh, we've also got that little sun in the tower, too. 
Keith: [overlapped] Yeah, we didn’t-
Austin: Oh, I forgot about the little sun! 
Sylvia: Mhm.
Austin: Mm. 
Keith: Sun bug.
Dre: Austin, I like your horse. 
Austin: That's good because I don't. [light laughter] We have one, two, three, four, five, six projects going. Silk farm, which will wrap up this turn. The Nü-Metal Яefinery, which will be done in four turns. A library, which is gonna wrap up this turn. The farmers... like, sense of community, which will wrap up in four more turns. Saboteur School- Adaire’s school, which will wrap up in two turns. And Lem's trip to Velas, which will wrap up in four. It has four uncheck boxes. I think that's kind of it. Whose turn was it? Who had drawn this card?
Ali: I did. 
Austin: Oh boy. [Ali laughs] 
Keith: Oh, right. 
Austin: Can you remind us of what it is? 
Ali: Yeah. So, this is the King of Autumn. [reading] ‘A natural disaster strikes the area. Choose one. You focus on getting everyone to safety. Remove an abundance, and project fails.’ Or, ‘You focus on protecting your supplies and hardware, at any cost. Several people die as a result.’ Uh...
Austin: So... what are you thinkin’? 
Ali: [laughs] So, maybe this is a conversation. Because I feel like the- if we're moving an abundance, I feel like the obvious one is food and water. And I feel like this is a really big like- 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: -point of priority in this community. Which is like, are we going to... Are there people in the community who are just going to say that like, ‘No, what I'm going to do is defend all of the people here. You know, the good of the many versus the good of me.’?
Austin: Mhm. 
Ali: Or are we just gonna let this stuff go... you know- [laughs] 
Austin: In which case- in which case, what's that mean for the community at that point?
Ali: Right. Yeah. Exactly. 
Austin: Here's a question. Do you have something in mind for what the disaster is? 
Ali: I... I think- When I think of like, weird weather patterns on like, tree planet [laughs] with a bunch of suns, I tend to think of really big rainstorms. Especially with like-
Austin: Ooo, interesting. 
Ali: We have these weird pollen clouds... 
Austin: Yeah, we did already set that up. 
Ali: [laughs] We have a lot of like, weird precipitation. 
Austin: Right. 
Ali: The water’s being lifted up a lot, I bet, cause there’s many suns. Um-
Austin: In some way, didn't Art sort of start this clock when- Didn’t Janine start the clock with pollen clouds, and Art tick it with pollen hail? 
Ali: Yeah, perhaps. Perhaps. 
Austin: Wow. 
Ali: But yeah, I was thinking of it as being like, a big hurricane. But I think the question is like, of… of the people who are still within the community, do we think that there are people who would like, give up their lives for our food and water abundance? [Austin sighs] Cause the thing I don't want to do is just like, list off a bunch of NPCs
Austin: Right. I don't know. Like… Honestly? I look-
Jack: That's a grim fuckin’ question. [Ali laughs] 
Austin: It’s a grim question. I believe in my heart of hearts, that communities come together in crisis. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: That that instinct is often manipulated and minimized and- and- But that that is not an unnatural response to actually come together in a crisis. On the other hand, this is a community in a very loose sense. It's a community that has- and I’ll go over these in this moment- It’s abundant in food and water currently, sunlight, and maps. It has some access to flight. It has some access to safety, by way of the death of bugs by an increasingly, seemingly, occupying force. It is low on population. It is not a big community. It is- doesn't have great roads and paths. It is still working on that whole knowledge base thing. It does not have good tools. And most importantly, it does not have- it is scarce with community- with the feeling of unity. Which you would think, ‘We stabbed the lightning bolt with the magic sword of unity, shouldn't that have just made everyone happy?’ Turns out not so much. So-
Ali: The food and water abundance is like, a big deal. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: And I think that like-
Janine: But like-
Ali: Go on. 
Janine: I mean that's the thing is like, if you're in a situation where you are used to having a lot of food and water, and you're sort of comfortable with that because you've had it for a little while now, but population is scarce? Is that when you're gonna get like, real self sacrificing?
Austin: Right. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: You go like, ‘Eh.’ [Ali laughs]
Janine: Cause like, the thing that we don't have is people, so… And we're, you know- if we're used to having certain resources- I don't know. 
Ali: Right. Yeah. I mean that's the other like, turning point, in terms of this decision for me. Which is like, a big priority for keeping that stuff is like, keeping power versus the Grey Duke. But I don't know that that's anyone's priority at all. I like-
Austin: I think the table's pretty split on that. 
Ali: [laughs] Yeah.
Austin: It seems like some people really want to keep that power, right? 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: And I think you're right, though. And I think that that is part of this choice. 
Ali: But I mean I think, in terms of like, the people who are under the PCs, so to speak- 
Austin: Mhm. 
Ali: -do not care where they're getting their food from. 
Austin: Right. Right 
Ali: So-
Austin: Right, right, right. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Just like, the average citizen of the Last University is hoping to eat. Whether or not that food comes from the Grey Duke or from Ephrim and Corsica’s magic university land. [Ali laughs] Like, what do they care? 
Ali: I think- I mean the other part of that is like, after Spring and after seeing people do this sort of thing for their community, have we really not raised the sort of population that that would kind of-
Austin: Right. 
Ali: -that would continue to do that? 
Austin: To help people, you mean? In this case? Focus on getting people to safety [overlapped] versus letting them die.
Ali: Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ‘Hey, we pushed through hard times before.’ 
[0:15:00]
Ali: Right. 
Austin: ‘Maybe I don't have- maybe we don't have as much food for a little while. Maybe things are a little tight, but we're all here together.’ 
Ali: Yeah. 
Keith: I mean the big- the other big hit is the project failure.
Austin: That is the big one. 
Austin: [laughs] Uh huh. 
Austin: Maybe? I mean you can tell me which one that is. 
Ali: I don't know. Projects- I don't know. I um-
Austin: I don't know her. [Ali and Sylvia laugh]
Ali: I feel like the easiest one is like, maybe we don't leave for Velas at this point of our like- it's really rainy. [overlapped] We lost all of our food...
Jack: Yeah. Like, narratively that fits really well.
Keith: ‘Yeah, I don't want to go anywhere today.’ [everyone laughs] 
Austin: ‘Where-? I don't even know where my rainboots are. I think they're upstairs in the attic.I just-’
Janine: [overlapped] I mean also you mentioned a hurricane.
Austin: ‘I'll just order delivery.’ 
Janine: Like, who's going to go on a hang glider in a hurricane? 
Austin: Right. Right 
Ali: Yeah. 
Jack: Right. It’s just this visual of like, all of the gliders which have been like, bolted to the trees just like, shifting and flapping in the wind. And all of the glider pilots looking outside, going like- 
Jack (as Glider Pilot): [sucks teeth] Ugh.
Austin: One of them is like, 
Austin (as Glider Pilot): No I can- I got this. 
Austin: Steps outside, and a huge piece of hail just like, completely devastates one of the gliders. Just rips a huge hole through it. Yeah. [Jack groans] Yeah. So, that fails. 
Jack: I mean if you're up for it, Ali. I mean that was- I was- I was making a suggestion rather than being like, ‘Fuck the gliders!’ 
Ali: [laughs] Yeah. I don't know who chose the trip to Velas, so I apologize to whoever that was. 
Jack: I did! [Jack and Ali laugh]
Ali: Oh, well… With your blessing then, absolutely. Yeah. I don't know. I like- Because I don't wanna- I don't wanna write in more... like, sympathy into the- like the community that we’ve built, but I do think that there is- there is a… They've been through some shit. [laughs and pauses] Yeah, but I'm gonna go with the first one, which is-
Austin: Okay. 
Ali: ‘You focus on getting everyone to safety. Remove an abundance and a project fails.’ Which is food and water and the trip to Velas. 
Austin: Okay. At some point, you- Can you draw this storm and make it even worse? 
Ali: Oh, sure. 
Austin: Or some clouds or something? And then- and then, Jack, since your thing is failing, can you- can you draw some… [overlapped] bad gliders or something?
Jack: Yeah, absolutely. Just like, sound of- The sound of like, rain against all of the rooftops, and it's like late summer rain, as well, right?
Keith: Can you draw that?
Jack: Yeah. The sound of- the sound of rain over- over Tristero? [Ali and Austin breath a laugh]
Austin: Alright. Well, let me advance some different clocks. Op! That's a big line. [Ali laughs[ Oh, it's rain! Those are- That’s rain. I see. 
Ali: [amused] Uh huh. 
Austin: Great. Love it. Library completes. The silk farm completes. Who is in charge of those projects? 
Keith: I was in charge of silk farm. 
Austin: [enthusiastically] Tell me about the silk farm. [lightly laughs] ‘Shepard-’ [Ali laughs] Er ‘Grandfather, tell me about the shepherd again.’ 
Keith: We have bart- we have bartered with the spider. 
Austin: What's that look like? Cause you can speak to the spider, right? That's part of this deal. 
Keith: Yeah. Yeah. So, I think that Fero... Spiders are lazy. They build-
Austin: Oh, is that the deal? 
Keith: Well, they build the web so that they don't have to like- Like, there’s spiders that don't build webs. They just like, go out and hunt, right? Or they ambush. The spider like, builds its little house, and the house automatically traps food for it. And so, when it's not trapping food, then it's hungry. So, spiders can live kind of a long time without- without eating because all that it can do is just sit in its house and wait for food to come to it. 
Austin: Right. 
Janine: Same. [Austin and Sylvia laugh]
Keith: So, a spider can live like, a month or two with no food. 
Austin: Wow. 
Art: Is this like, true? Or are you just saying this?
Jack: [amused] Like, a treatise. Yeah, we got like, a little treatise on the spiders here. 
Keith: Well, the spider’s telling Fero about it... I'm like, ‘You need- You want- We can give you food,’ and just I'm figuring out how much food we have to give the spider. 
Jack: ‘Look. I don't want to move.’ 
Keith: So, we have the rabbit infestation. This spider is totally good on- We toss it some rabbits.
Austin: Oh my god. 
Keith:  And he’ll spin us some thread. We just-
Austin: I can't- I can’t-
Jack: We just pitch rabbits into- [laughs]
Keith: [overlapped] Yeah, you throw it-
Austin: Keith, how- why did you- Why did you implicate this poor spider in proto capitalism? Why? 
Keith: We need the thread, and we don't want to have to steal it. 
Austin: [laughing; incredulous] Oh! Okay. 
Jack: Oh! [laughs]
Keith: Cause it’ll will attack us.
Austin: [groans] Love to initiate- love to initiate primitive accumulation. I think this is great. I think it's a fun thing. If we could maybe move some rabbits into the spider web. 
Ali: Oh yeah.
Austin: Or figure out- maybe build a little- another little lemonade stand that the spider has set up to sell silk. Whatever y'all think is the right drawing. That would be good. 
Jack: Some kind of like, vaguely rabbit- Like, a lagomorhp-y industrial system that we’re developing here. 
Austin: Mhm. Yeah. I like this. I think that we're getting closer to good tools, right? 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: I think maybe that refinery kicks in, and those tools are not a scarcity. 
Jack: [overlapped] How does this-?
Keith: Yeah, so basically these tools- How does what? 
Jack: How does the spider silk... Does it come to us in like, big- big bales of silk? That's like, carried up into the university along the road? Or like, what does the-? 
Janine: Skeins? [skee-ns]
Jack: Skeins [skay-ns] or skeins [skee-ns]. 
Keith: Yeah. So, you sort of- You know, it's like a spool. A spool, but in reverse. You've gotta spool it up- 
Austin: Mm. 
Keith: -as it- I mean I'm sure it's a pile, and the pile gets turned into a spool. And the spool gets rolled somewhere, and then some guy that knows how to make the world's sharpest knife out of smoke will turn it into [Austin laughs hard] a tool or something.
Austin: His name is Stornras Glasseye. Okay?
Jack: Sure. The guy. 
Austin: He runs a very nice Youtube channel.
Janine: It wasn’t even smoke; it was soot. It was a rip off. [Austin laughs] 
Keith: Yeah. So... So, I think we can- I think that we can make a bunch of different things out of the- out of the silk, which is- 
Austin: Here's a question. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: How do people feel about making this stuff out of spider silk? Out of gigantic spider silk? Are people like, down with it? Does it just takes some doing? 
Art: Is anything weird anymore? [Ali laughs]
Austin: Good point. You know what? I'm gonna shut the fuck up. I don't know what I'm talkin’ about. 
Keith: [overlapped] You don’t-
Janine: Is the normal method of producing silk more or less upsetting than this? Or is it equal? I would say it's equal. 
Keith: Well, this- this stuff is, I think, too big to make clothes out of. Like, it's just the thread is too big. 
Austin: No, you just cut it, right? I guess it's hard to cut. 
Keith: Well, it's the circumference of it. 
Austin: You can cut it. 
Keith: Like lengthwise? 
Austin: You can cut it a bunch of different ways. 
Keith: I don't think that works. I think that like-
Janine: It could be like yarn. If you- Like, if you scale that, but it’s like yarn thickness.
Keith: It would- it’s-
Austin: Keith is saying it's too big to be yarn. 
Keith: It’s too- I think that it’s too-
Janine: Like, a rope?
Keith: -big even for that. 
Austin: I don't understand why you couldn't cut it to be smaller. 
Keith: [overlapped] I just think you-
Janine: Well, if it’s a single fiber, you can't split it.
Keith: Right. 
Austin: Huh. So, this is like a- It looks like a cable. Like a- like... 
Austin: Yeah, what's an example of this for real? 
Keith: Like the cables on a suspension bridge. 
Jack: Jesus.
Austin: But you could break those down. 
Dre: [simultaneously] You can uncoil those. 
Austin: You could uncoil those. You could make a shirt out of those. It would-
Jack: Suck!
Austin: You would have to be some sort of YouTube weirdo, but you could do it. 
Art: [overlapped] Take that Youtube people. 
Keith: Well, but the diff- But the difference is I think that those are- those are wound. This is one thing.
Austin:  Right, but you- 
Janine: Oh, I just found- Hang on. I just found magnified spider silk, and it's nuts. 
Austin: Please send me this. 
Keith: Oh, cool. Let's see. 
Janine: So weird. 
Keith: So- So whatever this looks like a probably- Oh wow! 
Dre: Oh, shit.
Austin: Oh, wow. This is sick! 
Ali: Eww. [Janine and And laugh] 
Art: Oh! 
Dre: It looks like just a really fucked up tennis net. 
Keith: [overlapped] It looks like bone.
Austin: It does look like a fucked up tennis net. 
Keith: I think it looks like a fucked up like, arm. 
Dre: Really fucked up arm, Keith. 
Keith: Yeah, it's really- it's a really- Imagine if someone really messed up your arm, and then like-
Dre: I don’t wanna. 
Keith: -and then they took- they took pictures of what the bone was, and then maybe put some silk shit on it.
Jack: [interjecting] Stop it!
Ali: What?
Austin: Stop this.
Janine: Silly string. That's the thing it looks like. 
Austin: It does look like silly string. 
Janine: Silly string. 
Austin: It does. My point is look at all these little threads in there. You could do something with that. 
Janine: Here’s another one. This is fuckin’ weird.
Austin: Keith, let me help you all. [laughing] You can make stuff with this stuff 
Keith: [resigned] Okay. Alright. Now that I'm seeing it close up like this, it does seem- But it's so big. It would be- Yeah, it would be- I mean if you can, you know, form it into a knife, I'm sure that you could figure out how to make a shirt out of it. 
Dre: Did y’all know that spiders can just re-eat the silk they're not going to use? 
Jack: [shouting from afar] Everybody stop! [Sylvia laughs]
Austin: You heard them. That's it. We're done. Wrap it up. The end of Hieron. [Jack laughs lightly] Alright. Tell me about this library. Whoever was library-ing. 
Dre: Oh, that's me. Sorry. 
Austin: Okay. I was worr- I was like, wait. Isn't it Dre?
Dre: There's a lot of facts about the creatures we were just talking about. Um-
Austin: Yeah, are they in the library? 
Dre: No, no, no. 
Keith: So, they could be. 
Dre: Here's the thing. I don't know what this library looks like because I think, on one hand, Throndir was kind of counting on Benjamin to help out with this. But he and Blue J are leaving.
Austin: Benjamin- Benjamin- They left. They've been gone.
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: They're gone, at this point. Yes. 
Dre: So, I don't know who else would help with this library. Or if Throndir and Kodiak are now just librarians. 
Austin: Right. 
Jack: I can't imagine Lem not throwing- not throwing in a hand to build a library. 
Austin: And this library, again, is like, ‘Hey, we have all this stuff.’
Jack: Mhm. 
Austin: ‘Some of the books are damaged. Some aren’t. Let's organize everything we have. Let's see what it is.’ And going from there, right?
Dre: Yeah. Yeah. 
Austin: Okay. Cool. Then I think you- You tell me. What's it look like? 
Dre: Well, you know the diplomacy stand? 
Austin: Yeah. 
Dre: Okay. So, it's like that, but that's like-
Austin: Oh my god.
Dre: -the check in and check out table. No, I mean I think it's-
Austin: Okay. Yeah. No. 
Dre: It's probably just like- 
Austin: It’s humble. 
Dre: I mean yeah. Cause like you said, there's- I don't know how many books are left that are in like, decent enough condition. There probably are some books where it's like, “Well, we've only got a half of this one, but there's like, enough in here that's readable.’ I imagine, you know, they're probably used to be a much grander library in the Last University.
Austin: Mhm. 
Dre: And this is just kind of set in like, the first floor of that. 
Austin: Yeah I think that's- I like- I like that a lot. I like the idea of like, ‘Hey this thing that was once sort of a huge grand living library and massive in scale is now this one floor.’ But it's a very effective one floor. And it's been made by the people living there, instead of the wizards- or the mages from years ago. You know? So, I like that. Alright. Ali, still your turn. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Do you want to start a project, discover something, or hold a discussion? 
Ali: I kind of want to start a project. 
Austin: Okay. 
Ali: Since we've introduced the pollen thing- 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: -I've been wondering if there's like, a way to sort of like, extract- like pick them up and pile them up and like, sort them far away from the city areas to kind of get the bugs away from us a little bit. 
Austin: Mm. 
Ali: And I think that like, maybe this is a good time for it because after having that big rainstorm or whatever, like, people are seeing giant bugs and all of those puddles-
Austin: Oh true. 
Ali: -they’re like, crowded around rivers. And they're like, ‘Oh, these bugs really dig this pollen.’ [laughs]
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: ‘Why don't we just kinda- let's see what happens. Let’s like, you know, leave some out and see what happens.’ And the bugs go, you know, chomp a little bit. [laughs] And then they're just like, ‘Oh, okay. Let's see, you know- Let's see how this works.’
Austin: How would you define that project in a phrase? 
Ali: [laughs] Pollen traps?
Austin: Pollen traps. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: [lighter] Pollen traps. 
Ali: Mhm. 
Austin: Okay. Alright. Pollen traps. How many steps do you think that is? Just settin’ them up and tryin’ to- and testing them out? 
Ali: Um, is that a- It's either four, six, or eight? 
Austin: It's really between three and six is what I would say. 
Ali: Okay. 
Austin: Is what we should really be using. I use eight sometimes for big dramatic things, but no one should be using eight. It could be smaller than that even, if it's really a small project. 
Ali: I feel like it's four. Cause I explained the process. It was like, there's a big rainstorm. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: People notice the thing is happening. People test it out. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: And then once it’s tested out-
Austin: And we’ll see how it goes.
Ali: -we kind of set it up. Yeah. 
Austin: Where are we- where are we puttin’- Where am I puttin’ this clock? 
Ali: I just- I'm gonna put some pollen right behind this horse over here. 
Austin: Okay. 
Ali: And then you can stick the clock like, right there. Back where Janine’s- [inaudible from laughing]
Austin: Yeah. Gotcha. Just near that big square. 
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: Got it. Pollen traps. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Boop. Bop. Bop. Bop. Save changes. There you go. Four steps. 
Jack: Does these pollen traps like, attack the bugs? Or is it just like, more to get them out of our hair? 
Ali: I think that it's literally just like, big- like, these big balloons of pollen that the bugs go like-
Austin: Oh, balloons. 
Ali: - just chomp on. Or they chill out over there and like-
Janine: Like, a hummingbird feeder?
Ali: -they just like to be around it. Yeah. 
Austin: Huh. 
Ali: I think it's bug food. 
Austin: It's bug food. 
Ali: Yeah.  
Austin: Just gotta feed the bugs.
Ali: Right. 
Austin: Get ‘em out of your hair. 
Ali: Right! And like, as we’re setting-
Austin: Sacrifice the pollen. 
Ali: [laughs] As we're setting up roads and stuff, we can be like, ‘Oh, we can set up a pollen trap like, that way.’ And then our road is gonna be here. 
Austin: Turn the pollen into pollenade. Right.
Ali: And then- Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Keith: So, it's like- it's a bird feeder. 
Ali: Yeah!
Austin: That is what- Yeah, that is what, yeah, Janine said. 
Keith: Oh, okay. Great. 
Austin: Alright. Good job with the pollen traps. Let’s see how those go. I'm gonna draw a card, as it is now my turn. I got the Four of Autumn. 
Sylvia: God! [Jack sucks their teeth and exhales] 
Ali: Well. 
Austin: ‘The strong-’
Keith: Autumn sucks! 
Austin: We ain't even in winter yet. ‘The strong-’
Keith: Can I take a contempt for what the games says?
Austin: Yes. Yes. Yes!. Yes. [reading] ‘The strongest among you dies. What caused the death?’ Or ‘The weakest among you dies. Who's to blame for their death?’ Boy, this sucks. Why you gotta put this on me? [Sylvia laughs] I'm the one- I don't wanna make this decision. 
Janine: Yeah, I was gonna say I hate this card as much as I hate the fact that you drew this card. 
Austin: I'm not trying to be mean. This isn't a thing! I- I- [sighs] 
Keith: Well, Red Jack's already gone. 
Austin: Left the community, so safe somehow. I'm on some next level like, ‘How do I turn this back- back around on them?’ type shit. [Ali laughs] So, I think the weakest among you dies. And that's Alyosha who has been sick in a bed for weeks and weeks and weeks. And uh…  I have a couple questions about this. One is, did anyone make time to go see Alyosha? Did word get passed around that he was here and sick? 
Art: I was gonna work on it, but I didn't do it. You know, I didn't... 
Austin: No, I get it. But here- that's my- 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
[0:30:00]
Austin: My question is is that a thing you didn't do? Or is that a thing that didn't come up? Do you know what I mean? 
Art: I mean it's a thing that doesn't fit in the actions of the game. 
Austin: Sure. I mean it could. You could- you could have made a project that is like- 
Keith: Discover something new? 
Austin: Discover something new. Or, ‘I'm going to make a project. I want to help Alyosha get back on his feet.’ Or…
Art: Yeah, I considered that. But I didn't get to it. Like, and I don't- I don't need this moment. You know. It’s not important to me. 
Austin: No, my- Sorry. My point is did you- did Art not get to it or did Hadrian not get to it? 
Art: Um...
Austin: And I’m not doing that just to be like, ‘Hadrian’s to blame for his death.’ 
Art: Sure. 
Keith: But I do think that now. [Austin and Keith laugh lightly]
Art: The first one is definitely true. Art did not get to it. 
Austin: Right. 
Art: But I don't- I don't think that it's true that Hadrian didn't get to it. Or at least, you know, Hadrain didn’t… I don't know. 
Austin: Then, tell me what it was like to visit him a little bit. Tell me what it was like for Hadrian to visit someone who… And Ephrim, too. As two people who were both part of the same church at one point. Cause again, Ephrim, you were the person who was closest to him in these- in this last year. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: Was this something where you... where you also didn't get around to it? 
Sylvia: I think-
Austin: Or is this something where you did and-? Yeah. 
Sylvia: I think it's one of those things where when he first got brought in, Ephrim made more time for it. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: But like, he wasn't improving, and he was like, sleeping more and more. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: So, he kind of just kept going with less frequency. 
Austin: Mm. Is there a scene here? Is there a conversation between the three of you? Maybe not right before he dies, but sometime in this matter of weeks and months? Really what I want to know is like, do the three of you ever talk about Samothese? 
Sylvia: I'll say if we do, Ephrim’s not the one who brings that up. 
Austin: Sure. 
Art: But like, I am curious, you know? 
Austin: Mhm. 
Art: I do want to know what- and not- maybe not even about- Mm. I want to know what it was like to work the forge, you know? 
Austin: [laughs lightly] You know, just some- some craft talk. Just some... Yeah. I think there is probably one day, you know, a few weeks in where he is in a good place. 


[Jack de Quidt’s “Alyosha” begins playing] 


Austin (continued): A better place than he'd been in. And he calls for both of you without really any explanation. But it's so that he can get a look at the two of you cause it's- it's… He feels like his time is coming to a close, and he wants to know- I think he says this as much. He says like,
Austin (as Alyosha): I want to know... who I'm leaving this world- whose hands I'm leaving this- this world in and its spirit... Hadrian, you’ve- You're older. 
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah. It's been a long time. 
Austin (as Alyosha): Ephrim, how does the new world treat you? 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): It doesn't come without its dangers, but I think we're starting to make something pretty special here. 
Austin (as Alyosha): Mm. I thank you for your visits over the last few years. [pauses] Hadrian, do you still keep the faith? [music intensifies]
Art (as Hadrian): [exhales] I mean... It's hard... I.... I was still going to services. I was doing the work that I could, but it's... It's hard when you know they're not there. 
Austin (as Alyosha): We all know too well…. The man who we served for years was a deceiver. And he left me a deceiver’s tools. [music softens] But the time I spent preaching in Rosemerrow, in Velas, across the Steppe... the people we all helped in his name. I still think... [exhales] I do not know.
Austin: He looks away. 
Austin (as Alyosha): Do the people build new faiths... under these trees? 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): I don't think so yet. Everyone's so focused on just making it to tomorrow, you know? 
Austin (as Alyosha): That's when people pray the most, Ephrim. Be careful. [drums] They'll find someone new to pray to. 
Art (as Hadrian): Of course they will. 
Austin (as Alyosha): I meant be careful that it's not you. 
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, that's a great tip, honestly. 
Austin (as Alyosha): I don't have many things, but the guards have them. And if there's anything that can be of use while I'm recovering, please just…
Austin: And he kind of slinks back deeper into- into the bed. Like, he's not saying goodbye, but he is gonna just go back to sleep if no one says anything else here as he's- as he's kind of tucking himself back in. [music fades out]
Sylvia: I don't think I have anything to add. I think I’m like, leaving- 
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: -some fresh flowers for him to brighten up the room. 
Austin: Sure. 
Sylvia: And that’s it. 
Art: Yeah, I'm good. 
Austin: Alright. In some ways, I think Alyosha is to blame for his death. Certainly it is he who drove himself this close. But in other ways, it is everything else that led him to where he was. It's as much, you know- It’s as much everyone else in the- in the chain of Samothes to Malothese to the church that was corrupt all the way through to the Spring itself and the cost of the forge. And also, yes, Hadrian and Ephrim in smaller ways along the way. But I don't know that there are any clean hands here. I do wonder if word of who he was and what he did ever spreads. Did people ever know that this was the person who brought Spring into being? Or does that stay between Ephrim and Fero and Alyosha? 
Keith: Oh, I certainly don't consider that a secret. 
Austin: [laughs] How does that-? 
Sylvia: I guess that’s our answer. 
Austin: Yeah. Uh huh. How does that spread? Like what- And this is open to the table. How do people think about the fact that like, there is a person with a name who you can point to and say, ‘That's the guy that- what made the trees come.’ 
Keith: [overlapped] That did this? 
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: Well, I- So, I know how it gets out. And it's just that like, something happens and Fero’s like, ‘Eh, Alyosha.’ [sound of mocking’] ‘Bleh!’ [everyone laughs] Like-
Austin: It’s a good impression. 
Keith: And then- an impression of Fero? 
Austin: Yeah. Uh huh. [Keith laughs away from the mic] 
Keith: Uh, and then someone- and then like, someone’s like, 
Keith (as Random Person): What were you talking about? 
Keith (as Fero):  Oh, it was like- Oh, yeah. That guy Alyosha. Do you know...
Austin: ‘Used to be a priest.’ 
Keith (as Fero): Was cookin’ up all the plants with the- with uh- with fake Samothes blood.
Keith: And they're like, 
Keith (as Random Person): What? Fake Samothes? 
Austin: ‘What are you talking about?’ 
Keith: And I'm like, 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, there is this guy that was pretending to be Samothes for a long time, and he was a bad guy. Ephrim killed him. 
Austin: [laugh shouts] Oh my god!
Sylvia: [laughs] Oh Jesus. 
Austin: [groans] Ughhh, the prophet, Fero. 
Jack: I think, for Lem at least, it- Lem sort of begins to actively engage in that process. As someone who's always kind of had an- As someone who's always found it easier to deal in mythmaking than sort of the direct response to a situation, being... As soon as Alyosha passes, it somehow becomes easier for Lem to conceive of the Spring as, ‘Oh, that was something Alyosha did.’ 
Austin: Right. 
Jack: And like, you know, Lem knows the terms of like, the legend almost. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: But I think it's very easy for him to to feed into and feed from the embellishments that he hears from other people, right? Where it's just like-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: ‘Oh, I heard that that dude made the Spring.’ And Lem’s just sort of like , ‘Yeah, I guess. Yeah, I guess that is how I would tell that story.’ 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Or how I would interpret that story.
Austin: Okay. 
Jack: He was a weirdo. [Ali snorts a laugh]
Austin: Yeah. Uh huh. I'm going to start a clock with my- Or I'm gonna advance a clock- I’m gonna advance clocks first. Easy to forget that when it's not the same turn. Oh, did I skip one of these? One second. Let me zoom in and see if I skipped a thing. [whip crack foley] I did. Boop. Saboteur School finishes. Let's start there, actually.
Janine: [excitedly] Heyyy.
Austin: Let me know how that goes, Adaire.
Janine: I think that this is... I mean I feel like I- [laughs] I feel like I had a thing for this when we were- when I originally put it up there, and now I'm like, ‘It's probably fine.’ Um.. I- Okay, right. I got my notes. So, I think this is probably a little similar to the mapmaking school of like, you're not gonna make amazing spies in a six week spy crash course. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Janine: But also, we're not fully in a situation where we need like, an army of like, super spies goin’ out there with like, cyanide pills and like, guns that are built into shoes and whatever. 
Keith: [amused] Is cyanide pills the first thing you associate with spies? 
Janine: I don't know a lot of successful spies. [lightly laughs; Keith and Sylvia laugh for a bit] Anyways. So, yeah. I think it's a case of like, this is- these people have been given a competent head start, but experience is still kinda gonna be the thing. I mean I think the one thing it did actually do really successfully is it probably really cemented Rix and Rowe’s skill set
Austin: Mm. Yeah. 
Janine: Because not only did they get to be around for lessons, but they were also involved in a teaching capacity in a more helpful way than the mapmaking school. 
Austin: Yes. 
Janine: Like this is taking advantage of skills they already had and building on it. So, it really- You know, it's- when you ask students to teach other students, it cements a lot of things. And it's a very useful exercise for them. Yeah. 
Austin: Cool. They- You've changed their classes in- I’m playing a lot of Fire Emblem right now, [Janine laughs] and so there’s a lot of class changes happening. So. But you didn't actually. They're both probably still rogues. Anyway. Uh.. nice. Or thieves? What's the- what's the-what's the book in... Wow, it's been so long! It's been three weeks, and already I forget the names of the Dungeon World classes. 
Janine: Thief. Yeah.
Austin: Thief, not rogue. Okay. So, Hella, do you remember when everyone- when guards came to you and were like, ‘Hey. Yeah. There's like, a weird guy at the fairy circle’?
Ali: Mm hmm. 
Austin: That happens again. [Ali sucks her teeth] Except this time it's like,
Austin (as Random Guard): Hey, there's a big stone person at the fairy circle. 
Ali (as Hella): Oh. 
Austin: And standing there, in the middle of the fairy circle, which I'll draw momentarily, is Galenica. They have arrived, and they've told the guards that they will be here in your community for a couple months. Does anyone want to speak to Galenica to hear what they're here for? 
Keith: Yeah, I want to. 
Ali: I’ll go. 
Art: Yeah, probably. 
Austin: Okay. I think when you come up to them, they are looking over this- the edge of this branch looking down at other Velas. And they turn and face you, and I think they say hi to you first, Fero. They say- 
Keith (as Fero): Hey! 
Austin: Before they speak, you say, ‘Hey.’ Good. 
Austin (as Galenica): Hello. How have you been, Fero? 
Keith (as Fero): Wow. It's been really nuts. 
Austin (as Galenica): It has been very busy- 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Galenica): -since I saw you last in Alcyon. 
Keith (as Fero): Honestly, immediately after that, I was busy. And I haven't stopped being busy. 
Austin (as Galenica): I have not met your friends, but I have heard of them. Hella, yes? 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. Nice to meet you.
Austin (as Galenica): Pleasure. Severea speaks highly of your strength.
Ali (as Hella): Mm. 
Austin: [in Galenica’s voice] And Hadrian. Is your microphone stand working? [Ali and Sylvia laugh] I take that as a no. You’ve typed ‘No’ in the chat. 
Austin (as Galenica): I hope you don't mind my visit. 
Ali (as Hella): Not at all. Are you- Are you still in touch with Severea? 
Austin (as Galenica): Not often. 
Keith (as Fero): She told you about the moon, right? 
Austin (as Galenica): Yes of course. When it passes just so, and I'm near enough my statue, and I feel whole enough, I can speak with her. 
Ali (as Hella): Do you not feel whole now? Is there something we can do to help? 
Austin (as Galenica): No. Whole isn't the right word. 
Ali (as Hella): Ah. 
Austin (as Galenica): It is simply a matter of reach. All of my limbs are longer when I am closer to what I left behind in Alcyon. But that does not make me any less of myself when I wander. 
Keith (as Fero): Oh, are you- Is this- Are you- are you the Galenica that I- that like, I talked to or are you the one that was off doing other stuff? 
Austin (as Galenica): We are the same. 
Keith (as Fero): Okay. 
[0:45:00]
Austin (as Galenica): But I was the one wandering. Now tell me, in the conversation that's ongoing about reconfiguration, have you come to a decision? 
Keith (as Fero): Um, anti.
Ali (as Hella): I didn't realize the conversation was still ongoing. 
Keith (as Fero): Oh, I thought that- I thought that Samot shut the book on that one. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. 
Austin (as Galenica): Oh, had word not…? I see. 
Austin: They look back over the thing and look down at Velas. 
Austin (as Galenica): The people of Velas, or this Velas, at least, had heard. There was petition. Some have asked me to return things to how they were. To remake this. And so, I am listening. 
Ali (as Hella): Oh. 
Keith (as Fero): Isn’t that just going to fuck shit up again? 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. What's the tradeoff? 
Austin (as Galenica): I don't follow. 
Ali (as Hella): Well- [stammers and laughs]
Keith (as Fero): Do you remember a couple minutes ago about the Heat and the Dark? 
Austin (as Galenica): [lightly laughs] Of course. 
Keith (as Fero): That's the- that's the problem.
Austin (as Galenica): I see. But perhaps, I can simply use this as new material. I will try it a few times and see what happens. Until we find a new solution. 
Keith (as Fero): I don't mind the big trees, honestly. 
Austin (as Galenica): I see. Many others are very upset about this change. I cannot speak for them, but I listen. They pray. They meet me on the road. They dream of the way things were. 
Keith (as Fero): Is anyone asking you or is it just a feeling that you're hearing? 
Austin (as Galenica): Oh, I have been petitioned. 
Keith (as Fero): Petition- visit- Like, literally petitioned. 
Austin (as Galenica): Yes. 
Art (as Hadrian): How is someone figuratively petitioned? [Ali breaths a small laugh]
Keith (as Fero): You know, if a bunch of people have a feeling and then gods are like, ‘That sounds like a petition to me.’ 
Austin (as Galenica): That also happens. But when I run into members of the old Grand Tour, when I have visited places like the Kantons or even the Buoy, I have heard, ‘Galenica, can you not return us to what we were?’ And so, I am considering it. 
Keith (as Fero): Hard against. Big anti. 
Ali (as Hella): Well, how much- how much would be changed? 
Keith (as Fero): Don't even- don't- don't even- 
Ali (as Hella): I’m asking. 
Austin (as Galenica): This is a- this is a fair question. There are ways and there are ways. A more complete reconfiguration, which I think is possibly, uh... has the potential to be a very fruitful exercise, could change everything.
Keith (as Fero): Including people? 
Austin (as Galenica): No, I- I suppose Samot has left a bad example. Oh, Samot. I would build a new layer, like the old one. I would stop what is now chaotically growing and create a world from it. 
Art (as Hadrian): It's very hard to feel like that's a good idea after Samot. 
Ali (as Hella): Well, it would just be more layers, like before, right? 
Austin (as Galenica): Like before. 
Ali (as Hella): And if- 
Austin (as Galenica): So many had lived in the strata below. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, you want to do a whole new thing- You want to put- you want to add another piece of the onion.
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, onions are great. 
Austin (as Galenica): Onions are fantastic. 
Keith (as Fero): No, I was not- It was not a positive. I wasn't trying to positively compare it to onions. 
Ali (as Hella): Since when do you not like onions? 
Keith (as Fero): I like an onion, but I'm just saying- But do you want- do you want to live as the second outermost layer of the onion?
Ali (as Hella): Well, we'll just go up there if we don't want to. 
Keith (as Fero): Is that who you want to be? 
Ali (as Hella): People had fine lives below. There was that cool bar down there. 
Austin (as Galenica): People have always found lives below. 
Ali (as Hella): I guess we need the sun. 
Austin (as Galenica): The sun would continue. 
Ali (as Hella): Oh, right! There were suns on every level. This is- We’re fine! 
Austin (as Galenica): I would do my best to restore things as they were. If that was impossible, I would do my best to take in the will of those who pray to me. 
Keith (as Fero): Why- I- Why can't you just leave it alone? 
Keith: Contempt! 
Austin (as Galenica): Because people are suffering, Fero. 
Keith (as Fero): People are going to suffer whether you turn it back or not. And that could end up being way worse. 
Austin (as Galenica): It could, but work is never done. Do you not improve the world you walk through? Certainly I see from here buildings and structures and some broken gliders? I think? 
Keith (as Fero): I don't put people on top of people and buildings on top of buildings until the world starts to fall apart. 
Austin (as Galenica): Perhaps you do not, Fero. But I see encampments all around us. I see people packed into dormitories. I've been to cities. I see Alcyon from here. People stacked on top of each other. I do not doubt that some would be hurt, seriously, in any reconfiguration. In the same way that I do not doubt for a moment that those who live in this world that is so hostile toward them will continue to suffer and die, as well. I seek only to extend what those who pray to me, those who stop me, those who beg me seek. And it is only consideration and conversation. This is why I visit. 
Keith (as Fero): Well-
Austin (as Galenica): I will mark you as opposed, Fero. 
Keith (as Fero): Hard opposed. 
Austin (as Galenica): Do let your people know though, please. Do let them have the option. 
Keith (as Fero): Mhm. 
Austin (as Galenica): You must see. You must. 
Keith (as Fero): I must nothing! 
Ali (as Hella): Fero.
Austin (as Galenica): You would hide this from them? 
Keith (as Fero): No tell- I'm not gonna- I'm just not gonna do your chores. 
Austin (as Galenica): Of course. If you would allow me access to your campus, I would happily let people know. 
Ali (as Hella): We'd love to have you. I- I would. 
Keith (as Fero): Love? After that?
Ali (as Hella): [quietly] Just, you know, hospitality, bro. [Ali laughs lightly] 
Art (as Hadrian): You can't throw out anyone who has an opinion you don't like. 
Ali (as Hella): That.
Keith (as Fero): Well, you also don't have to say, ‘I would love to have you.’ 
Ali (as Hella): I do. I'm a nice person. [Austin laughs]
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah. Some people are nice. I have a book I can lend you. [Austin and Ali laugh]
Keith (as Fero): [animated] Oh! Hadrian and Hella! Some people are nice! These are the two nice ones! 
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, some people change. 
Austin (as Galenica): Fero, why do you shout? We're all in the fairy circle. No shouting in the fairy circle. 
Keith (as Fero): That is not a rule. No one ever said that. 
Ali (as Hella): Well, you should have respect for the circle of the fairies. 
Keith: I take one step out of the fairy circle. 
Keith (as Fero): [shouting]  Is that better?! [Sylvia and Dre laugh] 
Austin (as Galenica): [resigned] Oh, Fero.
Keith (as Fero): How’s that?! 
Austin (as Galenica): A familiar voice. 
Keith (as Fero): Fuck off! 
Austin (as Galenica): Thank you for your hospitality- 
Keith (as Fero): [quietly] I'm already gone. 
Austin (as Galenica): -Hadrian, Hella. 
Ali (as Hella): You're welcome. 
Art (as Hadrian): Any time. 
Austin: Love it. 
Ali: [laughing] Hadrian and Hella. 
Austin: So, Galenica’s here for eight weeks. 
Ali: Fwoo. 
Art: How are we- how are we-?
Austin: And does- 
Art: How are we- That’s eight clock steps? 
Austin: That’s eight clock steps, yeah. Every- every clock step is a week. Every turn is a week. I’m gonna draw a big statue person here. Uh... But otherwise, I think my turn is done. And we'll see how this Galenica thing goes. 
Keith: Was that a- Was that clock for um… Okay, yeah. You started a clock. It wasn’t-
Austin: I started a clock. That's a new clock.
Keith: I wasn't sure if it was discover something new, and you did your weird GM stuff. 
Austin: No, no, no. This was start a clock. This is start a clock. 
Keith: Okay. 
Austin: Keith, it is your-
Keith: Hey, what’s up?
Austin: -turn. [Keith groans ‘ugh’] Draw a card, Keith. 
Keith: [reading] ‘A project finishes early.’
Jack: Oh. 
Keith: ‘Which one? Why? If there are no projects underway, restlessness creates animosity, and animosity leads to violence. Who gets hurt?’ Luckily we've got plenty of projects on the way. And let's see. Which one finishes early? 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Um… God, I know what I want to do. No. [Ali breathes a laugh]
Austin: What's- what do you-?
Keith: How ‘bout uh...
Austin: What are you knowing. 
Keith: I wanna- I wanna make Galenica leave now. [Sylvia and Dre laugh]
Austin: Uh huh. But?
Keith: But it doesn't say a project fails. It just says a project finishes early. 
Austin: It does say that. Now I could steeple my fingers and encourage you to finish it early and then pull some trick. But I'm instead going to read from the rules. ‘If a project finishes early because a card says that quote- a project finishes early- in bold text, it is instead the responsibility of the active player to tell everyone how it turns out and to update the map.’ So, if you had a genuinely interesting idea here that was not just an extension of ‘Fero thinks- of what Fero thinks,’ and is like- 
Keith: It is. 
Austin: -’Here is an interesting way for Galenica to move on quickly. Here's why they're moving on. Or here's why their visit is finished so quickly,’ then you could narrate that for us. As long as it wasn't just like- I would be happy with you narrating that, as long as it wasn't just- Or if it's some sort of dramatic action from Fero, but not just like, ‘And then they said they were done and moving on.’ 
Keith: No. So, the picture that I had in my head was like um- just like, general shithead like, you know, like, yelling over- [laughs] 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Keith: But I don't really want to do that. 
Austin: And also, that probably gets people more mad at the person yelling than the person- because of how people work.
Keith: Yeah, or like, maybe Fero also passes something out being like, 
Austin: Mhm. 
Keith: -’No, do you really want things to- do you really want things to get all changed again?’
Austin: Right. 
Keith: But I don't- I really don’t- I just don't want to- I just wanna let it finish. 
Austin: Okay. So then, let's find something else. 
Keith: So, I think that- I think that it'll be… Hm. I’m deciding between two. Jack, the farmer community was yours, right? 
Jack: No, I think it was Dre's. 
Keith: Dre? 
Dre: Yeah, that was mine. 
Keith: What was the-? Can you remind me about the farmer community? 
Dre: So, that's like, kind of what the almanac thing was. Cause it was trying to like, create a- almost like a knowledge share between the different farmers. 
Keith: Right. It was a bunch of farmers were gonna share their- like, how they're doing anything on the plant. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Keith: No, I'm going to go with the pollen traps. 
Ali: Oh! 
Austin: Okay. 
Keith: I'm gonna- I’m finishing the pollen traps early.
Austin: What happens? 
Keith: I thi- I mean it- it's- I mean it works, which means that it draws all… It draws like, all the bugs that might eat some pollen over to the pollen traps. 
Austin: Mm. 
Keith: And- and they just kind of gather there, and they just are there now because they have a food trough. [Austin and Ali laugh] It's like, you know, if you feed- if you like, throw bread for birds, all of a sudden now cities are full of birds that know that they can get food if they hang around the city. 
Austin: What's the like- what's like, the knock on effect of this?
Keith: Well, there's a bug that is like, right next door to the refugee camp. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: And it's not there anymore. 
Austin: It's like, up there now? 
Keith: Yeah. And that- that's the last- But like, yeah, I think that- I think that it creates some really dangerous places, but it is making those places far away from- 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: -or at least, away from where people are. 
Austin: Mhm. Does the table think this changes safety? 
Janine: We know where the bugs are now, reliably. 
Austin: You do. Yeah. 
Janine: They're at the bug place. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Keith: And with- and this is- Safety is already halfway, right? 
Austin: Safety is neither a scarcity nor in abundance. 
Keith: Okay. 
Jack: Hm. 
Austin: My question is-
Jack: We don’t have fewer bugs is the thing. 
Austin: We don't fewer bugs. 
Jack: We do have, basically, bug zone. 
Austin: We do have a bug zone. 
Keith: And we have a bunch of bugs that aren't hungry. 
Austin: Yeah.
Jack:  Mm. Mhm. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Yeah, I was gonna like- If- if I was the natural ender of this project, I was either gonna go for safety or something like, ‘We can harvest bugs now,’ but I don't know if that's the thing. I feel like safety is one of the things cause like, especially in building roads away from the bugs is like- 
Austin: Yeah. Mhm.
Ali: -‘Oh, people can travel and exist and build communities and build stuff far away from where-’
Austin: Um, my two thoughts- Or my two questions- One, were you going to make it food and water? Were you gonna start eating these bugs? [Ali laughs] Two, do you feel safe from- do you feel fictionally like people are safe from the Grey Duke's forces, at this point? Which is also part of why safety is only halfway. 
Ali: Yeah, that was the thing that I was going to say, in terms of like, I don't know if this is enough alone- 
Austin: Okay.
Ali: -for safety to- Yeah. But-
Keith:  Well, I think that-
Austin: But the bugs fictionally are taken care of, at this point. Not ‘taken care of’ like a mob- Like they're- they're actually taken care of. Like, ‘Oh, we're taking care of these bugs.’
Keith: I think- I mean I think fictionally, part of the reason why the Grey Duke is a threat is because people were not feeling safe because of the bugs. 
Austin: Totally. They also have weapons, and you don't. 
Keith: Yeah, that’s true. 
Austin: They also have an army, and you don't. 
Janine: But also-
Austin: So, like, I want to underscore that they are still a threat in that capital ‘T’ way. 
Keith: Okay. 
Janine: You know what makes the Grey Duke way less impressive? When the thing the Grey Duke's people are doing is walking up to the bug feeding spot- 
Austin: Yes. 
Janine: -and just killing bugs that are eating pollen and being mostly chill. 
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Absolutely. No, I- 
Janine: That’s a slightly less impressive show for us. 
Keith: Let’s put some bug feeders- let’s put some bug feeders in all the Grey Duke encampments. [Ali laughs] 
Austin: I thought that's where this was going to begin with. 
Janine: Mm. 
Austin: You got spies. You got bug feeders, you know? But yeah. My only counter argument here is that like, they are also a physical threat that you don't have the defenses or- or militia to stand up against. But I guess, also, counter-arg- uh… Yeah. I think that's where I stand on it is like, unless we are certain that they're not going to attack people, you know? 
[1:00:00]
Janine: Does the Nü-Metal Яefinery complete on this term, anyways? 
Austin: No, I think I just advanced that. 
Janine: Okay. 
Austin: So, next turn. Next turn that’ll- that’ll-
Janine: You could wait until that happens to move safely. 
Austin: Oh, I thought that was gonna be good tools. 
Janine: Oh, that's a good- Sorry. Yeah. Yeah, that’s a good point. 
Austin: But all the stuff is interconnected, right? I think that this- I am completely under- like, underscoring and like, thumbs-upping that this was an essential component to getting safety. I'm just cautious because what I don't want to have happen to just to draw a card that's like, ‘There is a fight.’ And then us get to point to the fact that it says we have an abundance of safety when we know that that isn't true in these other very material ways. Cause who knows what the next card is gonna say. I truly don't know. I don't have a thing on that lets me look at the cards. I'm recording this, and you can check the footage. [Austin and Sylvia laugh lightly] But I think that's a step. Keith, what are you doing with your turn? 
Keith: I'm gonna hold the discussion. 
Austin: Hell yeah. As a reminder, you can either start with a statement, at which point you don't get to follow up, or start with a question, at which point you get the last word. 
Keith (as Fero): How do we really actually feel about the idea of Galenica turning everything back to regular and putting a new shell on top of Hieron?
Austin: Adaire is up first. 
Janine (as Adaire): Not gre- I mean... I don't- Look. I don't really know Galenica. I don't have any particular reason to trust what Galenica is offering. The on-paper look of it is sure tempting, but I don't generally trust the uh... on-paper point-by-point overviews given to me by people like them. It doesn't seem to usually shake out as cleanly as they think it is. I would love if they could make like, a very small model of the thing they want to do and show it to me, and then I could see for myself whether or not it was going to be viable. But I generally don't believe that what could be is going to necessarily be better than what we got right now. 
Austin: Throndir. 
Dre (as Throndir): [sighs] Ugh. I am tired of gods in all of these things that are above my pay grade. I think I'm just going to make sure this library runs okay. 
Keith (as Fero): [incredulous] Have you been getting paid? [Ali snorts a laugh]  No one's paid me. I've never- I don't think I've ever gotten anything that I didn't take off a dead guy. [Austin and Jack laugh]
Austin: Janine notes in the chat that Throndir is, of course, a vampire with a gun. 
Dre: Yeah! And he's tired! 
Austin: [laughs lightly] Aw. Ephrim. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): I don't think that there's any good to come from more reconfiguration. Especially when we don't know if it's going to keep the Heat and the Dark driven off. 
Austin: Hadrian?
Art (as Hadrian): We've met with and interacted with people from lower layers before, and it doesn't seem like they resented or hated their lot in life. I don't see a reason to- to feel this- this privilege or this right to be at the top layer. I think creating a new world has advantages, as long as we are free to live and do our thing here. I don't see this is as inherently sinister. 
Austin: Lem King. 
Jack (as Lem): Every time anybody has tried to reconfigure something, it's been a disaster. Why are they gonna do it again?! They tried it over and over again. They had to keep trying it. What's-? You know. If they go back to this- this cake system, at the bottom of which is- is presumably the Heat and the Dark again, we're just gonna get pushed down layer by layer. If the Heat and the Dark doesn't crawl up and get us first. Also, this place is amazing! 
Austin: Hella. 
Ali (as Hella): I think Galenica is here at the request of a lot of people. And that the people here deserve to have that as an option. And... we don't get to tell them not to do that cause we like to meet in this room every so often. [Austin breaths a laugh] You know, the Heat and the Other One withstanding, what do we have to lose? [Art laughs]
Austin: [laughs lightly] Fuck off. [Ali, Art, and Keith laugh hard] The Heat and the Other One.
Jack: Just taking a contempt real quick. [Austin and Ali laugh very hard] 
Austin: Um, I think Sunder is the one here who speaks, as the magic person. And she says, 
Austin (as Sunder): I'm of two minds. One, what if we could help… not just us, but people, all of us together, help shape whatever that new world is? What if we could help them decide what that looks like? Not like, the way Samot was doing it unilaterally. Just what if we could get in there and be like, Oh, hey. More mountains, please’? I like mountains a lot. Two, if this room decides ‘No,’ but the rest of the world decides ‘Yes,’ or enough of it, that Galenica decides, ‘Good enough,’ what do we do? What are we prepared to do? 
Austin: Fero? 
Keith (as Fero): I am absolutely prepared to stop Galenica from using this stupid power again. 
Austin: Hm. Okay. I think that's your turn. Janine?
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: Draw a card. Ooo. Oooo. 
Janine: [lightly laughs; then reads] ‘Introduce a dark mystery among the members of the community.’ Or ‘Conflict flares up in the community… [purposefully mumbling and trailing off] A project fails.’ Whatever. Um- [Austin and Janine laugh] 
Austin: ‘Eh, I've already made my decision.’ 
Janine: Failing a project is not interesting to me. A dark mystery among the members of the community... So, this should be a thing that doesn't have an answer. This is a- 
Austin: It's a mystery. 
Janine: It is a mystery, and it is dark. 
Austin: To us all, yeah. It is dark. 
Janine: Um… okay. What happened to Alyosha’s body? 
Austin: I don't know. Do you have a dark mystery? 
Janine: I'm thinking of dark mysteries that could involve Alyosha’s body. Um… okay. Oh okay. Yeah. So, I think what happened Alyosha’s body because we still have the Last University, which still has a graveyard presumably- 
Austin: Yeah... 
Janine: -is that Alyosha was buried.Um, I wonder if that graveyard actually looks different now. I wonder if the new graves are more like those um… You know the oven crypts they have in New Orleans? That are like- It's like a wall with a bunch of doors? 
Austin: Excuse me. Did you say oven crypts?
Janine: Yes. Yes, it’s a thing.
Austin: I didn't know about the oven crypts. 
Janine: They're called oven crypts because they look kind of like bread ovens. Like, old stone ones. 
Ali: Oh, there’s- [indistinguishable] 
Janine: Hm? 
Ali: Where it's like a coffin that you like, push into a wall? And that's why it’s oven-y? Okay, yeah.
Janine: Yeah, so I don't know that you actually use a coffin. At least in the old fashioned ones, it's like a- it's like two compartments on top of each other. 
Austin: Mhm.
Janine: And there's a slot in the back of the top compartment, and you basically put a body in the top compartment until it decomposes, and then you push the remains back into the slot. And they go into the bottom, and then you put the next body in. 
Austin: Wow!
Janine: So, family’s would have an oven crypt or things like that. It was basically a thing, I think, so that- because in New Orleans, you wanted above ground mausoleums because of the swampy ground and et cetera. You didn't want the that affecting remains. Rich people could afford an above ground mausoleum, but poor people, to ensure that they still got a burial that wasn't undignified geologically, they would have these big oven crypts. And like, a family would share a thing, and you cleared the remains out. Et cetera, et cetera. So, I'm wondering if because dirt is such a commodity now, in terms of farming- 
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: -if this has led to oven crypts becoming a thing. 
Austin: Sure. 
Janine: So, the dark mystery though is that- The oven crypts are probably relatively new. But I think the weird mystery is that, at some point, Alyosha’s remains have been put in one of these oven crypts, and maybe they need to make room. And it hasn't been that long, I guess, but they're just like- Maybe someone-
Austin: It’s been a couple of weeks. 
Janine: Yeah, maybe someone- But you still need longer than that to be able to push someone through a slot. [lightly laughs]
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: But my point is maybe someone is like, just going through checking on things to see like, who can we push to- you know, and change the plaques on the front, and you know, whose- whose turn is it? And they notice that in Alyosha’s crypt, there is like a- there's just like, a big hole that goes straight down. And at first, they just think it's like a big dark spot, but it's like, slightly in- It's- it's sort of where the slot is, but also in front of the slot. And they don't really understand it, so they have to send someone kind of smallish to crawl in there and take a look. But it is just- it's like a bore-hole. It is just a hole that goes straight down and is-
Austin: All the way down. Just keeps going.
Janine: It's got like, sort of grooves along the side that are very, very even. Almost mechanical, but like, not quite. And it just goes straight down into- like, into the tree. Like down-down. 
Austin: Right, right, right. 
Janine: Through the lower department in the crypt et cetera. 
Austin: Hm. That's a mystery. 
Austin: Do other- do any other crypts also have this? Or everyone else is fine? 
Janine: No. Everyone else is fine. Well, I mean the crypt that was below Alyosha’s does because it does. 
Austin: Yeah. Right. I gotcha. 
Janine: But yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. Does this change the way people talk about Alyosha at all? 
Janine: [laughs] Uh, I don't know. I wonder if this adds to the Alyosha myth of like, Alyosha being… of Alyosha’s like, importance. Because this is not a thing that happens to normal people. And like the Spring itself, it's sort of- it's like, this weird, mysterious, powerful thing, but also it has this very sinister sort of layer to it. Of like, is… There's good stuff, and there's bad stuff, and it's hard to know what you're looking at in that moment. Like, is this a- is this a thing to celebrate? Is this like, ‘Wow, Alyosha was something cooler than we thought?’ Or is this like a, ‘Uh oh.’ 
Austin: Right. 
Keith: It's so funny. It's literally the thing- the last thing he warned about before he died. 
Austin: Uh huh. Yep. [Janine laughs] I love just like, imagining the thirteen year old who is like, 
Austin (as Thirteen Year Old): [excited] I heard from the halfling who turns into a weird horse that that guys is God, and this proves it. His grave had a hole under it. He went down there back into the trees which he- which he made. He made the trees. And he's in there now. He went home. 
Keith (as Fero): [shouting from far away] Hey! Hey! Hey! [closer] Hey! I didn't say- I didn't say that! 
Austin (as Thirteen Year Old): You said he was God. 
Keith (as Fero): I didn't say that. 
Austin (as Thirteen Year Old): You said he was God. 
Keith (as Fero): Don’t tell him that I said stuff that I didn't say. I didn’t say- I said he knew god.
Art: [overlapping with Keith above] What fuckin’ panopticon shit is Fero on? [Austin laughs hard]
Keith: What’s-
Austin: [laughing throughout] Fero just breaking in to a children's classroom. [Ali laughs] Fero in the cafeteria like, from across the hall-
Keith (as Fero): I was working out a new bat thing, and it has really good hearing. 
Austin (as Thirteen Year Old): Anyway, that's why I trust you when you said that he made this Spring. Which is the trees. 
Keith (as Fero): That’s true. He did do that.
Austin (as Thirteen Year Old): Which is the world that we're in, right? So, that-
Keith (as Fero): Yeah.  
Austin (as Thirteen Year Old): Just like the old one. And so now-
Keith (as Fero): No, that was just magic. Just regular magic.
Austin (as Thirteen Year Old):  It’s the same. It's the same. 
Keith (as Fero): Anyone that uses magic is a god? You know how stupid you sound? 
Austin (as Thirteen Year Old): No, they- He made a world. He made a world out of it. When Sunder does stuff, she doesn’t make a world. She can't even make a house, probably. 
Keith (as Fero): She could totally make a house.
Janine: This is what happens when we let Fero teach the kids. They get really confrontational. [Austin and Keith laugh hard]
Austin (as Thirteen Year Old): You shut up. You don't know anything. 
Keith (as Fero): Shut up! 
Austin (as Thirteen Year Old): Why would you believe-?
Keith (as Fero): You don’t know jack shit! 
Austin (as Thirteen Year Old): You don’t even believe in god. 
Keith (as Fero): No! I know- I met them! 
/Austin (as Thirteen Year Old): This guy doesn’t even-
Keith (as Fero): [shouting loud] Of course I do! I saw them! They're dead- they’re mostly dead!
Austin (as Thirteen Year Old): [mockingly] Yeah, ‘I saw them. I saw them.’ Nyaahhh. That’s you! That’s what you sound like.
Keith (as Fero): If you don’t believe that I saw them, why do you believe me on the other stuff? It doesn’t make sense. 
Austin (as Thirteen Year Old): Cause there was a hole under the crypt! Obviously! 
Keith (as Fero): You’re- Carl, you’re driving me crazy today! 
Austin (as Carl): [mumbling sounds to mock Fero] Myea- car- byaah cray- [Keith laughs hard] Nyaaah. Bleh!
Keith (as Fero): Blehhh! [blows a raspberry] 
Austin (as Carl): Blehhh!
Keith: I turn into a big-
Austin (as Carl): You’re a dummy. 
Keith: I turn into a big tongue. [Austin laughs] 
Austin (as Carl): [disgusted] Ee-ugh.
Keith: [laughs hard] I turn into a big tongue, and my whole body does the spit thing at him.
Austin: [laughing] Just like flopping around. [Keith laughing hard; Austin grossed out] Ughhh. All the kids scream and run. 
Keith: [still laughing and trying to catch his breath] I- I turn back, and I'm just laughing. 
Austin: [groans a laugh] Janine in the chat, ‘Carl is Fero’s Blue J.’ [Ali laughs] Finally. Um, alright. Good dark mystery. I'm gonna tick some clocks. [thinking noises] Chu-chu-chu- Including the Nü-Metal Яefinery. As a reminder, N-Ü- Metal Яefinery. Backwards ‘R.’ Umlaut over the ‘U.’ So, that completes. 
Sylvia: Alright. 
Austin: I just drew a big circle- or a big purple symbol as I try to mark these other two also. I think the farmer community- completes also. So, let's start with a refinery. Talk to me about this-
Sylvia: That was mine, I believe.
Austin: I think so. 
Sylvia: Yeah. So, I think it's... I mean it definitely involves Stornras Glasseye to some extent. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Sylvia: Like, he is kind of our… sort of Master of the Forge here, in a lot of ways. 
Austin: Yeah. [amused] He prefers Forge Lord. 
Sylvia: Forge Lord? Okay. 
Ali: Mm. 
[1:15:00]
Sylvia: Duly noted. And I think it's- Like, it's just- The main thing with this project was mostly just finding out what is safe to do with the material and like, what… like, basically, the specifics of how to refine it. And I think- I don't know if there's like, an actual physical refinery, as opposed to just like, this is now a new job within the community. 
Austin: Right. 
Sylvia: There’s farmers. There's people who handle like... there’s- I can’t remember the name of the map scouts cause I feel like we had a different one, right? 
Austin: We did. They were- It was good. What was it? Out something? 
Sylvia: Outbound or something like that?
Austin: The Outbound. Was it Outbound? It was Keith came up with it, I think. 
Keith: No, it wasn't me. It was Janine. 
Sylvia: Oh, yeah. It was Janine. 
Austin: Well, Janine did the project, but someone else said Outbound. I thought.
Keith: I think that was also Janine.  
Janine: I thought I said I sent Outward. 
Sylvia: Outward.
Austin: Maybe you said Outward. 
Keith: Outward. I think it- I think it might have been Outbound. I don't know. [Austin laughs lightly] It wasn't me. I know it wasn't me. 
Austin: Okay. 
Sylvia: Anyway, all this to say that we have like, miners and smithee's now within our community, as opposed to just like, dealing with the stuff we've had, you know? 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. Between this and the silk, does this move good tools out of scarcity? 
Keith: I think it totally does. 
Sylvia: I do. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: Yeah, I think so, too. 
Austin: Maybe you get yourself in like a nice forge, and it moves all the way up to abundance. But- but I like it. Y'all got some tools again. You get to like- some, some good hammers made out of this thing. You got some good bags made out of the silk. I don't know. You build a bunch of stuff out of the silk. 
Keith: Hammers, bags, scythes. 
Jack: All the stuff you need to deal with the- the fact that that man's body just disappeared down a hole. 
Sylvia: We're just gonna drop this bag of hammers down there and see if hear the sound- [Jack and Dre laugh] 
Austin: [quietly] Okay. 
Jack: We have so fucking many hammers now. What are we gonna drop down there? Hammers? We got- we got ‘em. We can make another one. 
Austin: Um, cool. Uh, farmer community. Throndir. 
Dre: Oh, yeah. Okay. 
Austin: You finish making this book- this almanac. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: Which again, when you started it, a thing no one knew about was the pollen hurricane on its way. So, you've- it’s already out of date instantly, but the community aspect is what you're going for, not the knowledge aspect. 
Dre: Right. Yeah. 
Keith: [amused] Love to publish a wrong almanac. 
Dre: Whoa. Okay. That's mean. First of all. 
Jack: You want a comprehensive almanac is the thing. 
Keith: Yeah. Under index, under pollen storm, it says, ‘Never happens.’ [Jack and Austin laugh] ‘Don't worry about it.’
Austin: ‘Just hail. That's it.’ 
Dre: ‘Yeah. Not real. Don't worry about it.’ Um… 
Austin: So, is there something that like- Is there like, a publishing party? Is there a block party? Like, what is the- How does this lead to-? Is it just like, people walking around with these in their back pocket and being like, ‘I read in the- in the almanac what you said- what you said about the… planting vines on the branches. Good idea.’? 
Dre: So, I think there is a distribution of that, but I think there is also- there's a new section that opens in the library specifically for…
Austin: Got you. 
Dre: -farming, like, literature. Cause it's probably not a lot of that. 
Austin: No, totally. 
Dre: It's all like, magic and hoity-toity stuff. 
Austin: I'm glad that you have made like, the first agricultural program in Hieron. 
Dre: Listen. I opened the new DIY section of the library. 
Austin: It’s a theme with- with Friends at the Table finales. People gotta people how to fuckin’ do things. 
Dre: Mhm.
Austin: Love it. Alright. What is your action for the term? 
Janine: Speaking of teaching people how to do things. [sighs] 
Austin: Mhm. 
Janine: So-
Austin: [amused] Adaire Ducarte continues her teaching series? 
Janine: Yes. 
Austin: Okay. 
Janine: I’m gonna start a project. 
Austin: Okay. 
Janine: The project I am starting is... I don't know the name for this one. I've been trying to figure it out. But it’s- uh, it’s- I'm just goin’ with what I have right now, but I don't love it. I'm just putting that out there. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: Adaire Ducarte’s Academy of Challenging Domestication and Wrangling. [Sylvia and Ali laugh] 
Austin: Chal- challenging... Domestication and Wrangling? 
Keith: Is it domestication that is challenging? Or is this a protest group protesting Domestication and Wrangling?
Janine: It’s an academy.
Austin: It's an academy? 
Keith: [overlapping Janine slightly] An academy of protestors? 
Janine: I'm gonna teach people how to lasso the bugs and tame the bugs. 
Keith: Okay, so that’s what the challenge is.
Jack: What?
Austin: Okay. Time out. Does Adaire-? Oh. Adaire does know how to climb on big creatures.
[crosstalking]
Janine: It’s canon. I succeeded that roll.
Austin: This is-
Keith: And- and Adaire has rope. Like, a lot of rope. 
Austin: Y’all got a lot of rope. 
Janine: I have a lot of rope. I know how to lasso and climb big things. Also, Adaire’s family is hog farmers. 
Austin: I- I have to be- Hogs are different than giant bugs. 
Janine: I know, but we're all going to learn together. 
Austin: [resigned] Okay. [Keith laughs] Okay. 
Keith: Cause this is a co-learning business.
Austin: Who is helping-?
Jack: Hog and bug are very similar words. 
Austin: Yeah, you're right. They’re- they got- both got a ‘G.’ There's a vowel in there. [Sylvia laughs]
Janine: Pig babe. 
Austin: A hog babe. [laughs] Adaire Ducarte’s Hog Babe School. [Ali, Janine, and Sylvia laugh] School for Hog Babes. Uh… this is an inside joke. This was all just in chat. We only talked about hog babes quietly, right? Did we talk about hog babes out loud? No, we did. We talked about- 
Keith: I never heard hog babes in my life. 
Sylvia: [quietly in the background] We didn’t.
Keith: So, it wasn't to me that it was said or written. [Austin and Sylvia laugh] I'm gonna search our chat for hog babes. 
Austin: You gotta make sure you include the hyphen. 
Keith: Oh, okay. Sorry. Yeah. 
Sylvia: [quietly in the background] Oh, wait. 
Austin: [reading] ‘As a word for young pig, the word piglet only dates back to the mid eighteen hundreds. Before then, a young pig might be called a hogling, fourteenth century. A porket, fifteen-fifties. A hog babe, sixteen-hundreds. Or a gruntling, sixteen-eighties.’ Keith!
Keith: I totally forgot about this. Yeah.
Austin: [laughing] You were the first one to reply to this. [everyone laughs]
Keith: Yeah. I said that explains ‘Babe.’ Cinema classic ‘Babe.’ 
Austin: Oh my god. 
Keith: And ‘Babe Two: Pig in the City.’ 
Austin: Amazing. Yes. This has to be a long clock, right? 
Janine: They always are. 
Austin: Okay. Yeah. They always are. It a six?
Janine: I never asked for a short clock for founding a school to teach people some garbage. Also, I'm gonna spend one of my contempt tokens cause this is a hundred percent- The other two schoo- The other two schools, I feel like there is a pretense of like, ‘Oh, I'm solving something.’
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: This is- this is a bit of a vanity project. It's a useful vanity project. 
Austin: That's how the history books will talk about it. 
Janine: Yes. And boy, they're gonna talk about it. 
Austin: [breathes deeply] Add it to the fuckin- Where are you puttin’ it? Where's the hog babe school? Where's the bug babe school? 
Janine: Where's the bug bait that we’ve-? Is it the… 
Austin: So, here's the thing. It is to the north, above the Grey Duke’s territory. 
Ali: There's a few. 
Janine: Yeah, there's one here. 
Austin: Oh, I thought- Oh, there are a few. 
Keith: There's the one here. 
Ali: There's the one here. 
Austin: So, the closest one is this one. Yeah. 
Ali: There’s one here. 
Austin: Down near where Galenica- Glaenica’s hangout is. 
Ali: There's one here. 
Austin: So, maybe- 
Janine: I’m gonna go with the Galenica one. 
Austin: Okay.
Janine: Cause that spider is already cool with us, so it might be-
Austin: True. 
Janine: Maybe we could get Fero to like, talk the spider into like, helping us with practice exercises. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Janine: So, it's like a team effort. [Austin quietly sighs] 
Keith: What? Like asking the spider to let us lasso it?
Janine: Yeah. 
Keith: Okay. 
Austin: I don't think the spider is gonna say yes to that. I didn't make the spider though, so I don't- It's not my call. 
Keith: I’ll ask. 
Austin: Um, Bug School. [Janine laughs] Bug Ridin’ School. I hope you appreciate that I did an apostrophe. The yeehaw agenda continues. Oh, I made it a six step clock. It sounded like you were good with that. 
Janine: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. 
Austin: Okay, great. Dre, it is your turn to draw card- [Dre sings ‘do-do-do’ to a tune] as we march through Autumn. 
Dre: Oh, this has a lot of text on it. I don't like that. [Sylvia laughs]
Austin: Oh my God! Ohhh my God. 
Janine: That’s not good. 
Austin: Oh! Oh my God. 
Keith: I can't read it, but it sounds bad. Okay.
Dre: [reading] ‘The community becomes obsessed with a single project. Which one? Why? [Austin and Jack laugh] Choose one. They decide to take more time to ensure that it is perfect. [Janine laughs] Add three weeks to the project die. They drop everything else to work on it. All other projects fail.’ And we have projects underway. 
Austin: So, the last one is if there are no projects underway, which we don't need to-
Janine: And we just wrapped all our sensible projects. 
Austin: Though I do love that one.
Janine: That’s very funny.
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: Everyone becomes obsessed with bug riding.
Austin: It's either bug riding or Galenica’s vision for reconfiguration~. [everyone laughs throughout the following conversation]
Dre: Jesus. 
Sylvia: God. 
Jack: Wow. Wow.
Austin: You make your choices! 
Janine: What a good game. [Dre laughs]
Austin: The Quiet Year’s a great game. Uh huh. 
Jack: Yeah, Quiet Year is a phenomenal game. 
Austin: This is- Like, deadass, this is the best way for us to say goodbye to Hieron is like, ‘Oh, well, either a god is going to tragically remake the earth because the vast majority of people want it even though perhaps- perhaps it is not the right choice for everyone in the end. Or the community is obsessed with bug riding.’ [Jack, Austin, and Keith laugh] ‘Wouldn't it be cool?’ Um, so what are you doin’? 
Dre: Uh. 
Austin: Are you deciding- or is the community obsessed with a project and-
Dre: [overlapping] Yeah, no. They’re obsessed with something. 
Austin: Right. But that's- They have to be obsessed. 
Dre: Right. 
Austin: But are they making it perfect by adding three weeks, or are they dropping everything else to work on that one, failing all of the projects? 
Dre: You know who is very interested in the tactical implications of a bug cavalry? 
Austin: Who is that? 
Dre: Why am I forgetting the name of like, one of the most important NPCs?
Austin: Corsica Neue.
Keith: Corsica. 
Dre: There we go. Thank you. [laughs] It's been a week. 
Austin: Is-
Dre: Yes. No, it’s- 
Austin: Oh my god. 
Dre: It’s Corsica Neue. 
Austin: She is like, 
Austin (as Corsica): Oh wow. Yeah. Great idea, Adaire.
Austin: She looks around-
Janine: Oh my god. This is revenge. This is-
Austin (as Corsica): The tact- the tactician. [Ali laughs]
Janine: This is cause I took over Corsica’s former camp, and now she's like, ‘Oh, yeah. I can get behind this new one.’
Austin: [amused; jokingly as Corsica] ‘But just a couple of things. One, everyone needs cool armor and uniforms.’ 
Dre: Yeah, well, you have to make the saddles just right so that a variety of people can ride the bugs. 
Janine: You need full barding. 
Dre: Yeah. Well, we've gotta see what this Nü-Metal foundry and the silk farm can produce, as far as, you know, weaponry. 
Austin: Mhm. Yep
Dre: You know, we just don't want to assume that you need the same balance for like, a lance that you would ride- for that you use while riding a horse, while riding a bug. 
Austin: Yep. True. 
Dre: You know, the locomotion is just totally different. 
Austin: Love it. So, we're adding steps to this clock is what you're telling me. 
Dre: Mhm. 
Austin: I need a bigger clock. It's becoming a nine step clock? I guess, actually, I would immediately be marking one of them. So, it's still eight. It's- I'm using an eight step clock. But know that I just marked the first step off the clock. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: So, eight more weeks now. 
Art: No one thinks you're cheating, Austin. 
Austin: Okay. Someone- someone does. You know that's wrong. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: You know someone listening is like, ‘Austin keeps fuckin’ cheatin’.’ 
Keith: God. This- this turns into a really interesting card. Or like, a really like, positive card if you've got no projects under way. 
Austin: Oh, yeah. Wait, what did it do? One second. I'll bring it back out. What was the text on that? 
Keith: It was like, if you don't have any projects, then in addition to all the other stuff you do this week, hold a big- start a clock for a grandiose vision. 
Austin: Yeah, it says hold a discussion about the vision in addition to your regular action. So, like, that would definitely start-
Keith: Oh, it’s just a discussion? Oh, okay.  
Austin: Yeah, but you know, you still get to make a clock. So, you could do both, you know? 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: There we go. I've re-added it to the clock- or to- to the uh-
Keith: Damn. 
Austin: -to the map. 
Keith: I can't believe we could have had Galenica fail. 
Austin: [laughs] People are so obsessed with this bug ridin’ that Galenica’s visit just blows on by.
Keith: Yeah, ‘Did you know that we could turn things back?’ ‘Turn things back?! There's giant bug riding here!’ [Austin and Dre laugh] 
Janine:  I mean-
Austin: Alright. 
Janine: Look. Mapmaking. It's fun if you're a certain kind of person. Being a spy? Also fun if you're a certain kind of person. Bug riding. That's fun for the whole family. 
Keith: Universal appeal. 
Jack: Whole family. 
Austin: That’s rodeo.... Roach-eo. No, bad. 
Janine: Yeah.
Dre: Who needs a gondola anymore? You just ride a bug. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: Bugs are bugs. 
Keith: Bug riding is the ultimate keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. [Austin laughs] 
Dre: You don't need to lie to us. 
Keith: ‘Yeah, dog. Nah, it’s totally safe. Hop on!’ [Austin sighs]
Dre: It fixes so many problems. It gets rid of flight. Flight becomes abundant.
Austin: Oh my God. 
Ali: Yeah. This is-
Austin: I hate this.
Dre: Safety’s abundant. 
Austin: This is amazing. I can't believe we made-
Dre: You don’t need roads and paths anymore. 
Austin: Bug riders. This is the whole thing.
Dre: We’ve got population cause there's all these bugs here now. 
Austin: Bugs… [firmly] No. No. [Sylvia and Janine laugh]
Keith: They can talk. I talk to them. 
Austin: They don't have a lot to say. 
Dre: And they say, ‘Please ride all of us.’
Austin: [laughs] ‘Yeah, I love this.’ 
Keith: They’re my bugs. I decide how much they have to say.
Austin: [amused] What they say is, ‘I love being an animal of burden and war. This is fantastic.’
Dre: ‘It’s the sickest shit.’ Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. What are you doing-?
Sylvia: ‘Always dreamed of being a horse.’
Austin: [laughs] What are you doing with your actual turn, Throndir? 
Dre: I want to start a project.
Austin: Okay. 
Dre: This might be me having to spend a contempt token to do this. 
Austin: Okay. You’ve got two. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: Keith has five. Jack has five. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Just as a leader board situation.
Keith: This has been- It’s been incredibly contemptful for me. 
Dre: Yeah. Contemptuous. Cause it's whatever you're doing something- I mean like, I don't know. It's selfish at the expense of other people, right? Isn't that when you're spending a contempt die? Contempt token.
Austin: Yes, it’s when you're doing something selfish, basically. 
Dre: So, yeah. You tell me this is selfish, but um... Throndir leaves to go find Red Jack. 
Austin: Ooo. 
Jack: Woah. 
Dre: Cause I do think it is- it is just like-
Austin: That's contempt- that's contemptuous. That's selfish. 
Dre: Yeah. It is just-
Austin: I mean-
Dre: It's an extension of the Galenica thing where it is Throndir just being very like, tired. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Dre: And I think like, um… you know, in this last season, like, one of Throndir’s biggest pieces of first dialogue, when he was still The Ranger, was talking to all of the animals in the forest and being like, ‘I'm not of a city. Like, I'm not a people.’
Austin: Right. Right. Yeah. 
Dre: And then he spent ten plus years straight in a city.
Austin: Right. Building it basically. 
Dre: Yeah, yeah. And I don't think he's sad about that, but he just- it- I don't know. I think he's just tired. 
Austin: Jack, as the person who made the decision to- I think it was you- Red Jack leaving, right? 
Jack: Um…
Austin: Or was that not you?
Jack: Yes, it was. 
Austin: Okay. 
Jack: No, I believe it was. 
Austin: How long is this- how long- I mean, again, Dre, you can suggest a clock time for this but I want to defer to-
Dre: Nah, I mean I was gonna say eight. 
Austin: Okay. [stammers] Yeah. Unless it's-
Keith: So long! 
Austin: It's long. Throndir out for eight weeks. Tore his ACL. Actually, that’d be the whole season. That would not be good. Don't-
Dre: Yeah. 
Keith: He’s a vamp- got a vampire ACL. 
Austin: Oh, true. 
[1:30:00]
Dre: And I think he takes Ace with him.
Austin: Oooo. 
Jack: Ooo. 
Ali: Aw. 
Jack: Wow.
Austin: Wow. Fuck. 
Ali: That’s very cute. 
Austin: That’s very cute. 
Jack: Just like, with a bridle or riding Ace? 
Dre: No, with a bridle.
Jack: I don't think Ace would be like, ‘Ah, yes! Someone other than Red Jack!’ 
Austin: Right. Right. Do you-
Dre: Well, and also like, Kodak's coming, too.
Austin: Right. 
Dre: And I'm not gonna outride him.  
Austin: Right. You’re not gonna ride ahead. 
Jack: Sure. Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fair. Okay. Well, I've added an eight step clock to the table. 
Jack: What’s this clock called?
Austin: Throndir looking for Red Jack. 
Jack: Okay. I can't see the- the names of the last two clocks. 
Austin: Oh, can you not?
Sylvia: Yeah, I can’t either. 
Austin: Oh, sorry. My bad.
Jack: All I can see is Galenica’s vision. 
Austin: Oh, that means you're not gonna- You- [laughs] That explains why no one responded to ‘Bug Ridin’ and Army School.’ [everyone laughs] I was like, ‘Damn. I guess it just didn't play.’ My bad. [Austin and Sylvia laugh] 
Sylvia: My turn to draw? 
Austin: It's your turn to draw. 
Sylvia: Alright. 
Austin: [laughing] ‘Mom, it's my turn to draw on The Quiet Year.’ [Jack laughs] Oh shit. 
Sylvia: Oh man.  
Austin: Oh, shit! 
Sylvia: So, I drew the Eight of Autumn. [reading] ‘Someone sabotages a project, and the project fails as a result. Who did this? Why?’ Or ‘Someone is caught trying to sabotage the efforts of the community. How does the community respond?’ Oh man. 
Austin: A lot of- a lot of authorial control here. I love it. 
Sylvia: Yeah. How would- Like... I'm tryin’ to decide between-
Austin: Uh huh. 
Sylvia: [laughing] There is a very big narrative difference between someone trying to sabotage the bug school and someone trying to sabotage this god. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Sylvia: And so… [sighs] Hm. I do- I think I am leaning towards someone being caught trying to sabotage something.
Austin: Okay. 
Sylvia: Because I think-
Austin: A note there is it's broader than a project, if you choose that second one. Cause it's the ‘efforts of the community.’ 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: Which could be a project, but it could also be something already established in the community. Just to give you a broader palette. 
Sylvia: Yeah. I think that- One of the things I am thinking of is that just the like, sort of unspoken influence of people realizing that reconfiguration is a possibility-
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: -might ask them more embittered towards trying to make this work. 
Austin: Ooo, right. 
Sylvia: And that is just like, people basically acting out in a way where they're like, ‘What's the point in- Why- why should I tend to the fields right now? Galenica’s gonna fix this in a few months.’
Austin: Right. 
Sylvia: You know? 
Austin: I like that a lot. 
Sylvia: I think it's kind of like- Yeah, and it's kind of- it feeds into the community scarcity, I think, as well. 
Austin: Does that build into any particular moment? Because it does say, ‘someone is caught trying to sabotage the efforts.' Does that boil over in some instance of someone making a decision that is like, ‘This will fuckin’ get ‘em’? Like, ‘This will convince people that Galenica’s way is the right way.’ 
Sylvia: You know, I think it's something a little pettier than that. 
Austin: Ooo, okay. 
Austin: I think someone is found trying to destroy some of the sap plants- er not sap, uh, things. The pollen! 
Austin: The pollen traps. 
Sylvia: Pollen traps. That's what I was looking for. And it's just like- 
Austin: Who is it? Is it- is it a major person, or is it just like, some people? Like- 
Sylvia: I think it’s just like, some run-of-the-mill people. 
Austin: Okay. 
Sylvia: Like, it’s the people- it's like, people who were affected by the change in the Spring coming, but like, I don't know if we've zoomed in on a lot of those in a named way, so- 
Austin: No, we really haven't. No. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: Which is a- which is a problem with the format. You know what I mean? 
Sylvia: Of course. 
Austin: But yeah. 
Sylvia: But yeah, I think- I think it's more of that, and... I mean how does the community respond feels like- Is that for me, or can I ask that to the table too? Cause I'd love to brainstorm a little. 
Austin: Let's start with what you think, and then we can brainstorm and kind of build off of that. But it is your card, so I'd love to hear what you think the initial response is, at least. 
Sylvia: I think it's like- Oh! I- One second. I got dropped my mouse.
Ali: Mm. 
Dre: Oh no. 
Sylvia: I think it's like… The initial response that I think Ephrim and Corsica would have is like. ‘We need to keep an eye on this person, and we need to post more guards to the...like, to- in this case, like immediate knee jerk reaction, the pollen traps.’ But that's not like, a long term solution. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Sylvia: And I think that's kind of the thing that I'm struggling to come up with at the moment. 
Austin: Right. 
Sylvia: Like... There's part of me that kind of wants to lay bare like- like, put it all on the table about what reconfiguration is with just the people as a whole. But I feel like, trying to explain that and the risks of it is just not feasible with this. So, I think it's like- in particular- with this particular instant, the way we deal with this person is one, they are not working on the pollen traps anymore, they're doing something like, in the fields near the university where we can keep an eye on them. And two, like, we're more suspicious of people when they're coming close to those sort of-
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: -important tactical things. 
Austin: Like a heightened sense of like militant- er militarism- 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: -from the people who aren’t guards and stuff like that. 
Sylvia: Yeah. Like, there's more paranoia in the air, basically- 
Austin: Mhm.
Sylvia: -than there already was. 
Austin: Yeah. I like that. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: I like. Is there any other- did anyone else-? I mean it did sound like you wanted to open it up a little bit. Does anyone have thoughts on the way the community responds to this sabotage and to the larger split around the question around reconfiguration? 
Jack: I wonder if there's more of a sense of um… [sighs] factions beginning to-
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: -not necessarily move openly, but like, “Oh, this pub- like, these four tables in this pub are for people who support the reconfiguration plan.’ And if you sit down there and start talking about how much you love this new place, that's- this isn't the place to talk about that. 
Austin: Yeah, ‘This is a place to talk about the good old days.’ 
Jack: Yeah. Or just like- like, one unit of guards-
Austin: Mhm. 
Jack: -beginning to spend- make sure that their patrols don't quite match up with the other unit of guards because there’s some difference there. 
Austin: Yeah. I like that a lot. I'm advancing clocks. Um, which means we're at one of eight for Bug Ridin’ and Army School. Four of eight for Galenica’s visit. They are watching all of this very closely. Uh, and one for Throndir looking for Red Jack. Throndir, how's that goin’? How's the first week? 
Dre: I mean probably very quiet. 
Austin: Yeah. You said in chat that you had another thought here. 
Dre: Yeah, I think- So, I talked about, you know, that kind of inner reflection- 
Austin: Yeah. 
Dre: -on Throndir being like, ‘I don't- This feels weird, and I want to just get back out there and reconnect with the ranger-y side.’ But I think a big part of it, too, is between the Grey Duke and Galencia, there's like, a lot of inner conflict, I think, for Throndir.
Austin: Mm. 
Dre: Because he has a very negative reaction to kind of both those forces-
Austin: Yeah. 
Dre: -and like, what they stand for and what they would want. But then, you know, by doing this library and like, going door to door and like, talking to people to do this farmer's almanac thing, it's probably also hard for him to blame people for wanting-
Austin: Right. 
Dre: -what they are seemingly offering. 
Austin: It’s like, you know that people have reasons for working with the Grey Duke. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: You know that people have reasons for wanting reconfiguration cause you talked to them, and they're speaking from a place in their hearts. But also, it sucks. 
Dre: Yeah. And it's like, things are not as awful as they once were when it was, you know, those hellish ten years where like, everybody was dying and starving and sick, but like, things aren't super great for a lot of people either. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Dre: And it's like, what place do I have to stand on to tell people to reject these things out of principle? 
Austin: Right. 
Dre: When practically they need these things.
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: Or they think they need these things that are being offered.
Austin: Right. Right. 
Dre: And I think that's a question that is also turning around in his head a lot. 
Austin: That is some good color to what is- And this is what’s going on in his head as he's like, moving from root system to root system and like, swinging between- [laughs lightly] between trees and et cetera, doing all sorts of cool shit. [Dre laughs] Alright. Sylvia, you should still take an action this turn. 
Sylvia: Yeah. So, I would like to start a new project and that would be reopening the plans to go to Velas. 
Austin: Hell yeah. 
Sylvia: I don't remember what- 
Austin: It was a four step.  
Sylvia: It was a four step? Alright. 
Austin: Yep. You rebuildin’ the old uh- the old gliders? 
Sylvia: Yeah. Yeah, I figure like, one of the main reasons that's been called off was because the weather after the storm that happened, too. 
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Sylvia: Like, it’s kind of hard to use a glider in the rain. 
Austin: Take quite a little while. Yes. 
Sylvia: Yeah 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Yeah, I bet like, currents moving between the trees. It's like, ‘Oh, it looks calm.’ And then we see a bird just like, crash into it a tree trunk, like below.
Austin: [laughs] Right. 
Jack: And we're like, ‘Oh, the wind must be moving faster down there, even though we can't feel it up here.’ 
Austin: Yeah. Love it. Alright. That started. Uh, Art. Draw a card. 
Art: Alright. [reading] ‘The community works constantly, and as a result, a project finishes early.’ Or ‘A group goes out to explore the map more thoroughly and finds something that had been previously overlooked.’
Austin: Mm. Not a bad card. 
Keith: [overlapped] Yeah, it’s a good card. 
Art: Not a bad card at all. This is uh- 
Keith: These are both great options. 
Austin: [laughs] Dre in the chat has an opinion. 
Dre: Bug ridin’. You hear Throndir’s voice on the wind. 
Keith: [overlapped] Oh yeah. So, wait-
Austin: Bug ridin’. Bug ridin’. 
Dre: [sing-song] Bug ridin’. Bug ridin’. 
Keith: So, it's like- [laughs] It's like we were- Everyone's so obsessed with it that it's gonna take almost twice as long. [Austin and Sylvia laugh] But then they were so obsessed with it, they did- they did the three extra weeks worth of work, and then the other four weeks all in one week. 
Austin: Everybody got involved. [Keith laughs] If we can come together about one thing, it's bug ridin’. 
Keith: No one has ever loved anything… here or in old Hieron as much as these people love bug riding. 
Austin: I may want reconfiguration. You may want to live in this weird bug tree hellhole. But we can agree on one thing; we both love ridin’ bugs. 
Dre: If you're ready, let's do it. Ride on this buggy. 
Austin: This buggy. Uh huh. Yeah. [laughs] Ephrim says- er Sylvia says in the chat, ‘The annual bug jousts will bring us together.’ [Dre laughs]
Sylvia: That’s how you fix the community scarcity. 
Jack: Literally. As the bugs collide. [Austin laughs]
Dre: This is like, how the Hunger Games started. I'm pretty sure. 
Austin: Uh huh. So, Art? 
Art: I mean it seems so hard to go against the community here. [laughter] Especially against the community that's gonna have to work constantly to finish this project. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Art: I honestly… I might- Mm... No, it's gotta be bug ridin’. [Austin laughs] I mean nothing else really fits. [laughter] I mean the community can't work constantly, and Throndir finds Red Jack. That's not-
Keith: I- 
Art: That doesn’t respect the fiction, you know? 
Austin: It could, but yeah. 
Keith: I'm- I want to introduce the idea that we pulled the exact perfect combination of cards to now make community in abundance. Because of this. 
Austin: Bug ridin’. Community works constantly. Community is obsessed. I think it's community- I can imagine community moves out of scarcity, right?
Jack: Not into abundance. 
Austin: No. 
Jack: You know, there are some things bug ridin’ cannot fix. [Dre laughs] I have yet to find them. But. 
Austin: Listen. I think bug ridin’ is a great way to meet people. I think bug ridin’ is a great way to uh- to keep-
Keith: People start dating again. 
Austin: Yeah, of course. People are dating again. Obviously. That's why they’d stopped. 
Janine: There’s tourism. 
Austin: Right. But there are real political differences still held. We can all enjoy the Bug Olympics. But.
Art: But, you know, Coca-Cola sponsors it, and that’s always really fraught. 
Austin: Okay. So, wait. Real talk. Art, you finish this project now. Which means- because it was your card- which means you get to narrate how this goes. Tell me how this goes. Feel free to take advice from Janine who started it. 
Art: Oh, I didn’t know I was stealing bug ridin’. 
Janine: [laughs] You’re not. It’s just-
Austin: No one has bug- We all have bug ridin’. 
Janine: That’s the whole point of the community, being into bug ridin’. It's all of ours. [Keith laughs]
Austin: God. I can't believe Janine took a contempt token for this thinking it was selfish. [Janine laughs]
Keith: [still laughing throughout] I also like that it's- Like this is also an extremely regional practice. [Sylvia laughs hard] It's not like- It’s like, imagine if football only existed in like, one county. [Austin laughs]
Jack: God it's like, Alcyon are just like- like, looking through a telescope-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -and they’re like, ‘Are they on those- Are they riding them?’ 
Keith: ‘Are they loving it?” 
Austin: ‘There are hundreds of people. The spider is watching! [Keith and Jack laugh] ‘It's having a good time!’ 
Keith: The spiders got uh, foam fingers. And like, eight- on all eight hands.
Jack: [overlapped] Oh my god.  
Austin: [laughing hard] On eight hands! [Dre laughs hard] Green knight! Aw, I imagine it’s Medieval Times. And there’s a bunch of different… different bug knights. Um, so... we have to talk about-
Keith: The Hercules beetle always wins. It's scripted. 
Austin: We have to talk about what does looks like. Genuinely. 
Art: [questioning] And not just Bug Medieval Times. 
Austin: We can just start there. But like, are people... and again, Art and- and… starting with you cause you drew this card, but if people have ideas about bug stuff… Are they used for other things? Are they-?
Art: Well, I think bug riding’ and… 
Austin: Right. 
Ali: I feel like in a tree environment, it's like, the perfect horse replacement. [laughs]
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Dre: Yeah?
Keith: Yeah.
Janine: Horse replacement or ox replacement. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Janine: Like if you’re talkin’ about agricultural applications. 
Austin: Alright. Here's what I’m gonna do. I-
Art: And I think it gives us like, a little bit of like- I think it also gives people some like, confidence in our ability to defend ourselves cause we're not there yet-
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: -but like, you know- 
Austin: We ridin’ these bugs. 
Art: We have air. We-
[1:45:00]
Janine: Everyone here remembers when we were scared of shit- scared to death of these fuckin’ bugs, and now we're ridin’ them. 
Austin: Okay. 
Keith: Eight months later. 
Austin: Here's what I want. I want us to go around the circle, starting with Art, name a bug and a use for this community. Get ready to talk about what if the Flintstones had bugs. Cause we're livin’ it. [Ali laughs]
Art: Okay. 
Austin: Alright. Name a bug. What’s it do?
Art: If the Flintstones had bugs... 
Austin: Yeah.
Art: -there would- [laughs] 
Austin: The beginning of your third grade term paper. Your like- 
Art: Yeah. 
Austin: Your theme. 
Dre: ‘In this essay, I will…’ 
Austin: Mhm. ‘Webster's Dictionary defines bug as…’ [Dre, Janine, and Keith laugh] 
Art: It's like, we put up plant feeders, and the fire- the giant fireflies come, and they’re our street lamps, and one of them says-
Austin: [gasps and shouts] Wait! That’s the best! 
Janine: Oooo. 
Art: -’It's a livin’.’ [laughter] 
Austin: [amused] ‘It's a livin’!’ 
Art: ‘It's a livin’!’ 
Austin: Alright. Art. Done. 
Art: Are the Flintstones even on TV anymore? Does anyone-
Austin: No one knows what we're talking about. [incredulous] Did you see last-?! [groans] Oh my god. 
Keith: Are you talking about Zach Galifianakis? 
Austin: I'm talking about Cado and Natalie not knowing who Robert Redford or Paul Newman-
Keith: How is that possible?
Austin: -or Paul Newman. 
Keith: How is that possible? They did- they-
Austin: It’s fine. 
Keith: They knew the salad dressing? I just think that's so funny. 
Austin: People- a lot of people-
Sylvia: [quietly] I didn’t know either. 
Austin: Mm. See? [Sylvia laughs]
Ali: It's not bad. The pizzas are good, too. Just F.Y.I..
Keith: There’s pizzas?
Ali: Yeah, he-
Austin: Oh, there's everything. 
[crosstalking]
Ali: Newman’s-
Austin: Did you know that-
Art: Paul Newman makes a- makes a great line of products. 
Austin: Did you know that a hundred percent of the profits from that go to charity? 
Ali: Yeah, I did know that. 
Keith: I did not know that. Wow.
Dre: That’s kinda nice.
Austin: A hundred percent! Yeah. 
Keith: Didn’t- Was- Okay. 
Austin: A bunch of them including-
Keith: Was there a Waypoint commercial for Newman's like, lemonade? Was that Newman’s? 
Austin: Oh, was that Newman's? 
Keith: I’m pretty sure. 
Austin: That would be extra funny. 
Keith: I'm pretty sure it was like, Newman's like- like, zero sugar lemonade. 
Austin: I knew it was lem- Anyway, I'm sorry. We gotta keep moving. Jack. 
Keith: It's a- it's student loans now, by the way. 
Austin: Oh, fuck that. 
Keith: Yeah, really. 
Austin: [lightly laughs] Uh, Jack give me a bug. And what's it do? 
Jack: Grasshoppers. [Art laughs]
Austin and Sylvia: What do they do? [laughter] 
Keith: Flight. 
Austin: They what?
Keith: Flight. 
Austin: I’m askin’.
Jack: Okay. Grasshoppers. Big grasshopper bug things.
Austin: Yep. 
Jack: Manned by two people. 
Austin: Ooo. 
Jack: One person is in charge of, uh, where does the grasshopper go? The second person is in charge of securing and ensuring that the cargo strapped to the back of the grasshopper does not fall off. Grasshoppers are great cause they can leap really long distances, and they land very softly, which means that we can carry very heavy things vertically very easily.
Austin: Mm. 
Jack: And because grasshoppers are bugs, and because bugs- and I don't know how they do it- can walk on vertical and upside down surfaces- 
Austin: Jack, no one knows. No one. No one knows. 
Jack: Yeah, no one knows. 
Keith: Oh. 
Jack: Not even bug scientists. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: They've been fuckin’ trying for years. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Um… These grasshoppers can like- we can jump… You know, a grasshopper can climb a vertical tree branch and then jump to another vertical tree branch and everything. Lem is looking at his gliders right now [Austin laughs an ‘aww’] and feeling a little [laughs] a little weird about this. 
Austin: But no. Cause listen. We can keep ticking that clock, and now bugs are involved. 
Jack: Oh yeah. One hundred percent. Anyway, grasshoppers. 
Austin: Grasshoppers. Uh, Ali. 
Ali: I think that big caterpillars are a fantastic form of public transportation.
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: They're basically buses. 
Austin: They're basically buses. Do they start as buses? What happens when they become butterflies? Or do they not? Are these caterpillars forever? 
Ali: [laughs] Well, when they become butterflies, then they uh... fly. You know. So, that’s even better. 
Austin: Oh. Oh yeah. Okay. [Ali laughs] Yeah. You got me. 
Keith: Well, I mean- I mean there's always more caterpillars. [Ali laughs] 
Austin: Nah, I get you. 
Ali: [amused] Sylvia in the chat says, ‘That's Blades, baby.’ [Austin laughs]
Sylvia: It is! [Keith laughs] 
Austin: [groans] Maybe we're waiting. Maybe there's like, ‘Okay. These fuckin’ caterpillars, they're gonna turn into- into giant butterflies or moths soon. It's gonna rule.’ But they have a really long period of time between being giant caterpillars and giant butterflies because they're so big.
Keith: Oh, cause they’re so big? 
Austin: Yeah. [laughs]
Ali: You know... the bus system works. People gotta go somewhere in groups. 
Austin: Bus system works. Yeah. I'm not here to- I'm not here to judge your bug system- your bug system sounds great. [Ali laughs] 
Keith: Public transportation is a cater-pillar of every community. [Ali laughs]
Austin: We've- Yes. [laughter] We’ve already started on this…[laughter continues] Mmmm…. Mm. Um, I think this is the… the- Corsica Neuea’s new retinue of beetle knights. We’ve already talked about the Hercules beetle, a.k.a. the rhinoceros beetle, which I think is like, the big- like, the heavy cavalry. But all sorts of different beetles. And also, like, it turns out that when you make armor from that Nü- that Nü-Metal, it has like, a similar beetle-like shell sheen to it. And, you know, she's really invested in making that cool colors and making like, different divisions, and is basically playing toy soldiers, but with creating new divisions of cavalry troops. And it's like, a bunch of different beetles. But I think that she is now absolutely going to ride a gigantic Hercules beetle-
Sylvia: [whispered] That’s so good. 
Austin: -with that huge front like, nose thing. Dre in the chat says, ‘Corsica Neues’ most feared legion, The BeetleBorgs.’ Love it. Keith, give me a bug and a job. 
Keith: You know about how the entire town is covered in three inches of pollen?
Austin: I do. 
Keith: We have- we have figured out how to get the giant bees to come-
Austin: Oh wow. 
Ali: Oo.
Keith: -and collect the pollen off of our streets and our buildings. 
Austin: Do they move it right into the feeders? 
Keith: That would be great. [laughter] I think that they probably build a hive. 
Austin: Oh yeah. That's probably what they actually do. Yeah. Yeah. 
Keith: But it makes honey for us. [Ali lgasps] 
Austin: Delicious. 
Keith: For them, too. But for us. 
Janine: Local honey to treat allergies! 
Ali: Ooo. [Dre laughs]
Keith: Yeah. Local honey for- Yeah. 
Austin: To treat allergies. Well, you know what? We're done. We solved the game. Janine! 
Janine: Remember when Adaire fucking saved the world? [everyone laughs] With a big riding school. 
Austin: Bug school! Uh, excuse me. The records here say Adaire and Corsica Neue. 
Janine: [exhales] Oh god. Right. [Ali laughs]
Austin: Forever.
Jack: I think it says ‘army’ there, doesn't it? There is that word, ‘army.’
Austin: It does say- it did say ‘Army School.’ Yeah. Uh huh. Janine, what's a thing a bug does? 
Janine: What's a thing a bug does? [sighs] Um, I think that- [excited] Ooo, I know. So, especially in trees, sometimes you'll get like, little worms that- that- This isn't just cause I already did a thing with holes; this is just convenient. But you'll get worms and stuff and little bugs that can bore holes in the- in the tree. And I think what that does for us, as a thing that we can harness, is it lets us have like, an underground path network so people can travel sort of in a sheltered way-
Austin: Ooo. 
Janine: -from building to building. Or like, you can have store rooms and things like that. And it's kind of like a- like, some universities have things like that where it's like a-
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: -sheltered walkway system. 
Austin: Like a tunnel system. Yeah. 
Janine: Yeah, yeah. 
Austin: That was a big deal when I was in University West Ontario- Western Ontario because of the snow. 
Janine: Mhm. 
Austin: So. 
Janine: In our case, the pollen hail. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: I guess that's sort of taken care of, but still.
Austin: Great. Dre.
Dre: Hm. We don’t need the gondola anymore. We just got that spider. That spider is just gonna carry people. 
Austin: No. No. 
Dre: No?
Austin: I mean I guess everyone is okay with climbing on bugs now. I was gonna be like, ‘No one wants to do that.’ But no-
Dre: Well, okay. What about a silkworm then? 
Austin: Okay. I- 
Dre: Do silkworms- Okay, do silkworms actually like, make silk? 
Austin: I don't know. 
Keith: Yeah. They do.
Dre: Okay. Then, yeah. 
Janine: I think it's like, their cocoons or something. 
Dre: Oh, okay. They don't like secrete it and like, put it behind them?
Austin: I don't- I don't want to look this up. 
Dre: I don't either. 
Janine: There's a very relaxing video from that- from that Chinese lady who does like, everything. She does literally everything. And one of the things she did was she harvested silk from silkworms. 
Austin: Huh. Can I tell you... What if it's- Here's a thing that we have the ability to do. Uh, invent an insect. 
Dre: That’s true. 
Austin: So, is it a situation where the silkworms or the spider or something else just makes more gondola lines? 
Dre: Okay. Yeah, I'm into that. 
Austin: You know what I mean? 
Dre: Mhm. 
Austin: Like, smaller ones like- like, between buildings inside of the community. Between farms and other places. Like, et cetera. Maybe even one day to Velas. Distant-
Dre: [ominous] Bum bum bum.. 
Austin: Bum bum bum. Um, I like that. Ephrim- Sylvia. Last one. One more bug. 
Sylvia: Okay. So-
Austin: Oh, I don't love it. You're ready for it. 
Sylvia: I- I just got a real cool idea of like, a praying mantis helping harvest stuff in a field. 
Austin: Love it. Just-
Sylvia: With its big hands. 
Austin: As if they were scythes?
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: Oh, that fucking rules. [Sylvia laughs] This is good. And the bugs are cool with this? Is it a Pokémon situation? 
Janine: Yeah, I was just gonna say, did we just come around on pokémon? Is this just-
Austin: I think what we invented was pokémon. 
Janine: -working pokémon? 
Austin: Especially weird cause pokémon are literally just Japanese beetle fights. That's where it starts. [Sylvia laughs]
Janine: Oh, true. Yeah. 
Austin: It literally starts there. 
Sylvia: [amused] You can just say it. Pokémon are just bugs. 
Austin: Pokémon are just bugs. [laughs] All of ‘em. They're all just bugs. Even the ones that look like cows.
Jack: Fire type? Bugs. Bug type? Bugs. 
Austin: Bugs. 
Jack: Ghost type? Bugs. 
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: Electric mouse? Bug. 
Austin: Bugs. 
Keith: Pikachu’s a bug. 
Austin: Pikachu’s a bug now. 
Jack: I have a question which is, how did the Grey Duke's troops feel about this? Cause they’re big play was they arrived-
Austin: Dog! 
Jack: -and immediately killed one of these things. 
Austin: [excited] This is- We're gonna have to figure that out with a card or a project or discover something new. 
Jack: Cause they're gonna have an opinion. 
Austin: They- I don't think that this is- I don't think they love it. Or they love it. Or this is-
Jack: They’re gonna have some thoughts, feelings, and emotions about these bugs.
Austin: Yes. A thing that I think was probably happening about six weeks ago for the Grey Dukes’ people were like, ‘We are wasting time on this like, tiny little shithole. They don't have anything. This place is a mess.’ 
Jack: They have like, a fucking tower caught in a tree. [Ali laughs]
Austin: Yeah. There’s like a- 
Jack: That's it. 
Austin: That’s it. They got this jellyfish wearing a hat, and that is it. [Jack, Janine, and Ali laugh] And now they're like-
Keith: He has a tie. 
Austin: He does have a tie. You're right. 
Jack: Yeah, they like, ‘Let's get up and go. We're gonna give ‘em like x more amount of time.’
Austin: ‘Three more weeks!’ Yeah.
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: And then a god showed up, and then they figured out how to ride bugs in their society. [Jack groans] They became obsessed with it. So, on one hand, I think you're right. Scared. Shook. ‘Hey. Uh oh. They might be a fighting force now. Hey, maybe they can sustain themselves because they've come to adapt to use their new environment.’ Two, ‘Wait a second. We do need them to be part of the Grey Duke’s domain.’ 
Jack: [laughs] ‘This is bug city!’ 
Austin: This is bug city. That's what- Finally we have a name: Bugburg. [Keith and Jack laugh]
Ali: We did it. 
Austin: We did it.
Jack: I’m collapsing my mic arm. My mic’s going over here now. [Austin and Janine laugh] 
Austin: Amazing.
Janine: How do we feel about knowledge at this point, also?
Jack: Well, we have very limit- [laughs] 
Austin: No. 
Janine: That’s true. We have a lot of very specific knowledge-
Austin: [laughs] Yes. 
Janine: -but we still don't know like, how to make-
Austin: Yes.
Ali: Okay, wait. Well, no, no, no. We have built- we've built completely new transportation systems. Completely new lighting systems.
Austin: Okay. This is true. 
Ali: Completely new irrigation systems. 
[crosstalking; all overlapped]
Keith: Two- 
Austin: Okay. 
Keith: Two completely new resources for tool making.
Ali: We have an entire library people can- [laughs] People-
Austin: I feel better about roads and parts because here's the thing-
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: When someone flies their fuckin’... what- whatever the fuck they're flyin’ around on and pokes themselves on some new weird plant that's like, bright pink, and they come back and like, ‘I think I got poisoned by the bright pink plant,’ you still don't know how to solve that. 
Jack: Yeah. And then they die is thing. [Ali laughs]
Austin: And then they die.
Janine: But we can carry them into their- into their oven crypt with a bug. 
Ali: We check the library that we've been maintaining. There’s a library that- [laughs] 
Austin: Okay. It's- it's a library of old books. 
Ali: Mm. 
Austin: I like- I like- I'm gonna submit ‘roads and paths.’ 
Ali: Alright.
Jack: Because when you got bugs, roads and- you know, what is a road? Is that a road? It is to a bug. 


Austin: That is a road. 
Janine: It’s a scent- it’s a scent path that a- that a bee sees and then dances to show everyone else where the path is. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Janine: Or something like that. I don’t remem-
Ali: Mm. 
Janine: I might be confusing ants and bees. It’s the same shit.
Austin: I think, again, Ali, you're right that bug knowledge is real knowledge. [Ali laughs] I'm not taking that away.
Ali: And there's an almanac. 
Keith: Austin Walker wants to say that bug knowledge isn’t real knowledge.
Ali: The word almanac was used.
Austin: But we know the almanac is wrong! [Ali, Austin, and Keith laugh] 
Dre: How dare you. 
Austin: The almanac doesn't even- Do you know what the almanac says under B? ‘Stay away from bugs.’ That’s what it says! [Keith laughs]
Ali: Mm… There's a whole community- No, you're fine. You’re right. It's bad. 
Keith: That’s- You know what? I was-
Dre: It’s a living document, Austin. 
[crosstalking;overlapped]
Ali: I was just- Yeah. 
Austin: Every week-
Keith: I was pro-knowledge-  I was pro-knowledge until we- until now the almanac is wrong about bugs and wrong about pollen storms.
Janine: That’s true. 
Keith: I think we just need a short- I think we need a short almanac V2.
Austin: Almanac- Everyone with the almanac meets in the same town- the same part of town every week, and they open up to the back, which has a bunch of empty pages. And you add your patch notes. You add your addendum to the thing, and if one person-
Dre: Please, it's the errata.
Austin: Sorry, the errata- [laughs] The errata gets published. And everyone has to hand copy it into the back of their yearly almanac. Love it. Great. 
Ali: Yeah… 
Austin: I see what you're saying. I see what you’re saying. [Ali laughs] I do. Alright. Good- good turn- Wait. Is this turn not- Where are we at? Art, that was your card? 
Art: Yeah. Uh huh. 
Austin: I still have to tick clocks? Oh my god. [Janine laughs]
Keith: Did everyone do a bug? Everyone did a bug, right? 
Austin: Everyone did- everyone did a bug. 
Keith: Okay. 
Austin: Everyone got a good bug. Velas trip advances. Galenica visit advances. Galenica, wow. Y’all made bugs do stuff. Throndir looking for Red Jack advances. What do you do with your turn?
Keith: Was that Galenica in character saying, ‘Y'all made bugs to do stuff’? 
Austin: No, that was Austin doing it. But just is- 
Janine: It’s cause they were so close to the rodeo school for so long. It just rubs off. 
Ali: Yeah.
Austin: [lightly laughs] Picked up the ‘y'all.’ Yeah. Um, Art, what do you do with you turn?
Art: Ugh. Everything feels so meaningless now. 
Austin: Now that we ride bugs. [Janine and Keith laugh] 
Keith: This is great. 
Art: I guess I want to start a project. 
Austin: Okay. What's your project? 
Art: I'm gonna develop Unitarianism. 
Jack: Uh, hang on. 
Sylvia: [confused] What? 
Keith: That's the religious belief in units of measurement. 
Austin: No, that's the metric system. Please. [Keith laughs lightly] Tell me about the thing you're doing, Hadrian. 
Art: I'm taking Alyosha’s advice to heart and trying, you know- He said, ‘Make sure you don't end up as gods.’ 
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: So, I am going to develop a religion that is very clear that- that people are not gods-
Austin: Mhm. 
[2:00:00]
Art: -and trying to be, you know, inclusive and, you know, I'm- I'm just trying to like, make something for people to have. Like… like, unitarianism. Which, um, I’m gonna admit, I don’t know a ton about, and I didn’t spend any time looking it up on Wikipedia-
Austin: Great. Good. 
Art: -before I proposed it here. But I have an idea of unitarianism as a- as a good thing. Unitarianism’s- Unitarianism’s PR campaign has done great work on me. 
Keith: Is- I… So, the only thing I know about Unitarianism is that-
Art: Uh oh. [Art and Jack laugh]
Keith: -they say that there is- there’s no Christian Holy Trinity. It’s all just one god. 
Austin: It’s God. God exists. That’s their thing. 
Keith: God exists. And like- and there’s- there isn’t a holy spirit that’s a separate thing. And there isn’t a Jesus Christ as a separate thing. It’s all just the one guy. 
Art: That is how I understand it. Um, and you could tell me that they’re secretly very bad, and I would like to disavow every bad thing Unitarianism has done. 
Austin: But what you’re- so, what are the teachings? Let’s- Instead of making a comparison to a religion that none of us are experts in, but people listening might be part of or have had various experiences with, what does Hadrian teach? Who helps him? Is this a Rosana campaign, also? Is this like a group effort? Is this- Is Ephrim involved? Or is this just Hadrian next to his lemonade stand, builds a second stand that says, ‘Religion five cents’?
Ali: [laughing] I’ve have a god that I fucking worshiped this entire time. 
Austin: I’m sorry. It’s hard- Uh, it’s- You date her, and so it’s hard to think about what you do as worship. [Art and Sylvia laugh]
Keith: She wasn’t a god when you killed her. 
Austin: No, that’s what made her a god. 
Ali: Yeah. It was a group effort. 
Austin: Mhm. [Austin and Ali laugh] Hella, are you involved in this process?
Ali: I would love to be. I- You know. 
Austin: [amused] ‘Please invite me to the god talk.’ 
Ali: [laughing] You know?
Art: I mean, but it’s about find- it’s like, trying to find an inclusive and- and encompassing faith that like- and be a grounding thing for people. Ya know? Um, it includes- 
Austin: Is-
Art: It includes the gods that were. It includes the gods that we still know of. But it’s- it's trying to be chill and relaxed and…
Austin: [laughs] This is an easy one. 
Keith: Is this- is this like, the early Catholic church that was like, ‘Yeah, all the, you know, pagan stuff. Yeah, we do all- we do all that, too.’
[crosstalking]
Art: I’m gonna be real honest with you- 
Austin: You are also describing the church of Samothes. 
Art: -I don’t want to draw those- those parallels. 
Keith: I’m just sayin’ that’s what it sounds like. [Austin laughs]
Ali: I don’t want to interject [laughs] too much here-
Austin: [laughing] Sorry. Janine says, ‘Everyone, come to Hadrian’s weed church.’ [Ali laughs] No, Hella, please.
Ali: I- Well, because there’s like, an aspect of this that was like, fucking first um… first love letter Hadrian. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Where there was an aspect of his work that was like, ‘Oh, you believe that thing? Sure.’
Austin: Yep. [overlapping with Ali] That was literally where we started.
Ali: But everyone was working together. Yeah. 
Austin: Yes. And he was like, ‘Oh, no. Yeah, of course. The weird halfling gods or whatever?The ancestors? Yeah, those are- That’s Samothes.’
Ali: ‘We got those, too. Yeah, come on-’
Austin: ‘We got those.’
Ali: ‘Come on down.’ 
Art: But not that. But that, but not like that. 
Austin: So, I need- What’s that look like? I’m not saying no to this. This is a good idea that I want y’all to talk about. 
Art: Yeah. 
Austin: And Hella, feel free to be like, ‘Here is what I’m advocating for,’ too. [Ali laughs] But Art, go ahead. It’s your- it’s your project.
Art: I mean I’m just- I’m looking for like- I’m looking for some sort of like, non-judgemental synthesis. 
Austin: I-
Keith: You’re looking for a- for the green religion. [Ali laughs]
Austin: Right. 
Art: Yeah. 
Keith: The green-colored religion at the end of Mass Effect 3.
Austin: But what do you believe? What are- what are you- what are the lessons? What are the takeaways?
Art: I mean I- I guess like, what I believe is that the- is that like, divine influence is fading, and we should be prepared to like, do the next steps ourselves. 
Austin: How does this square with Galenica being in the room? [Ali laughs] 
Keith: Literally there watching. 
Art: I mean fading doesn’t mean gone. 
Austin: Right. How does this square with Hella being able to be like, ‘My girlfriend is the Goddess of Death.’
Ali: [laughs] Well, I think um… I already forget what Art- how Art worded what he just said, but I think that there is like, throughout this season, there’s been a bit of Hella that’s like, ‘People should live the best lives that they can, and then when it’s over, they’ll have peace.’ So, for like, Hadrian to be developing something that’s like-
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: -grounding, is the word- is also what she’s trying to do. Which is basically just like, ‘You know, even if this sucks right now, there are ways to find faith that are… that can be beneficial to you.’
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: ‘And even… you know, when you’re on the other side of it, you’ll have- if you want it, you’ll have time to yourself to also sort of like, just chill for a bit.’ [laughs]
Austin: Just chill for a bit. To- And to what degree is… history? Do you tell people about the events of Marielda? Do people know who Samothes- the Samothes-es were?
Art: Yeah, why not? Yeah, I guess like, the- Yeah, it’s a- it’s kind of like a tell all bible. 
Austin: All of ‘em are in there. All the orc gods. The Weaver King comes up probably. 
Art: I mean some of this I’m not sure Hadrian knows. 
Austin: Sure. The Archives might have some info. Lem, do you contribute to this at all? Or are you just like, ‘I’m good over here’?
Jack: Um, I think that… [sighs] I don’t know that- Lem has never thought of himself as a particularly religious person outside of the way the orcs kind of conceive of religion- 
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: -as a much more… um, secular thing. 
Austin: [amused] Uh huh. 
Jack: [lightly laughs] It’s also weird, right? Cause Lem has just being like, ‘Yeah, gods? I- I’ve encountered gods.’ I suppose, you know, in Hieron, it’s sort of a question of like, um… What do you and don’t you devote to these gods? 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: And I suppose for Lem the answer is like, ‘Not very much.’ Um… but I suppose what Lem is able to offer in a sort of unhelpful way… [Keith and Austin laugh] is the-
Keith: Encapsulate that. Just put it on- Stick it on Lem. [Austin laughs again]
Jack: [amused] Yeah, that’s Lem’s motto. It is like a little brass badge. Um, is- is some understanding of how faiths are structured from a- almost like, on a technical level.
Austin: Sure. 
Jack: If that makes sense. Cause I feel like, you know, um, the Archives being the place that it is, that is something that the orcs have a lot of experience with with their own faith. 
Austin: Mhm.
Jack: Of just being like, ‘Alright, who is the god of what? And how does this work with that? And how does this intersect with that?’ You know, ‘We might call this person by this name on this day-’
Austin: Right. Right. 
Jack: ‘-and that name on that day.’ And so, I think what guidance Lem is able to offer- and again, not a lot- is about this kind of technical of… the dogma almost. 
Austin: Right. 
Jack: The technical dogma of how something like this might be structured. 
Austin: Keith in the chat says, ‘Lem King.’
Jack: Yes. [Ali starts laughing] 
Austin: ‘I give you an interesting piece of information, and it’s up to you to make it useful.’ 
Jack: This is absolutely it. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Mhm. 
Austin: That’s it. Great. 
Jack: Lem is rolling sevens.
Austin: [lightly laughs] Always. 
Keith: Lem is a seven.
Jack: Lem is such a seven.
Austin: [laughs again] Alright. Uh, how many steps is that clock? Feels like a long one. 
Art: Feels like a long one, yeah. I’d take- I’d take eight. I’d take six. It’s whatever you think.
Austin: Probably an eight. 
Art: It’s a lot of research. 
Austin: Yeah. Building a new church feels… [Ali laughs] New chur- I’m putting it- I’m putting the clock under the spider, but I don’t expect you to build the church there. 
Janine: Spider church
Keith: Fero’s insulted that- that Hadrian’s big idea about the religion is to just not sidestep people’s weird questions about god stuff. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. 
Keith: What? We were supposed to not be telling the truth about all that?
Jack: I mean that’s an interesting position to take though given the way that we’ve seen Samothes control knowledge in the early-
Austin: Right. Yes. 
Jack: -in the early part of his realm. Where like- like, that question for Samothes was- was a really important one, and one that it- at least at the beginning, he had a very clear answer to, right?  Which is just like, how much should we let people know? As little as possible. 
Austin: Right. 
Jack: Um, and so for Hadrian to actually say like, ‘Alright, I’m gonna tell you what I know. And I’m gonna expect you to tell other people what you know-’
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Is a- is an interesting position, especially for a paladin to take, right?
Austin: Yeah. With that, Jack, it’s your turn to draw a card. 
Jack: Oh, hell yeah. Let’s do it. I hope it’s one of the good ones. 
Art: Why would you even say that? [Ali and Jack laugh]
Keith: ‘All your projects finish early. Start three new clocks!’
Art: This is card the-
Austin: [interested] Oh… [worried] Oh. Well. [groans]
Jack: It is the Two of Autumn.
Austin: [groans more] This could go one of two ways! 
Ali: Ooo-eee.
Austin: I mean that’s how cards work in this game. They can all go one of two ways, basically. So. [Jack and Keith laugh] But, you know what I’m saying.
Jack: Rolls a dice. ‘This could go one of six ways!’ [Austin and Keith laugh] Um- [reading] ‘Someone returns to the community. Who? Where were they?’ Or ‘You find a body. Do people recognize who it is? What happened?’
Art: Oh… wow. 
Ali: Mhm.
Jack: Did you just have an idea, Art?
Art: No, I’m reacting to the card. 
Jack: Okay. That was a broader reaction. 
Art: I mean I have ideas, but they’re all horrible. Don’t- don’t do ‘em. 
Jack: I mostly- you know- [sighs] Our- Kind of our three explorers- our three people who have traveled away from here are- uh, there’s four- are um, Red Jack-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -Benjamin and Blue J-
Austin: Mhm. 
Jack: -and then Severea. 
Austin: Severea, yeah. Also, Throndir.
Jack: Uh, yeah,Throndir. But I wouldn’t want to narrate Throndir. 
Austin: No, I’m just making sure we’re clear that Throndir is also outside. 
Keith: And also a lot of people that went with Severea.
Jack: Yes. Yes.
Austin: Right. A whole bunch. Enough that the word population is still a scarcity. 
Jack: Yes, absolutely. I- I have- Whoops. I have mixed feelings about um… I want a return, I think. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Jack: But I have mixed feelings about it being Red Jack. In part because I don’t to take narrative control away from Dre here. 
Austin: Mhm.
Jack: Like, we have this really interesting clock of Ace and Throndir looking for Red Jack. And I don’t want to say, ‘And Red Jack shows up [laughs] while you’ve been gone.’ [Keith laughs] 
Dre: [amused] ‘Hey, what’d I miss?’
Jack: I mean that is kind of interesting. Like, person goes out to find someone, and someone comes back independently of them.
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: But I don't want to- I don’t want to take that away from Dre. 
Austin: So, who returns?
Jack: Janine in the chat... [Austin and Jack laugh] Janine in the chat says, ‘We do also have a notable missing body.’
Austin: We do. 
Jack: We do. Um… It’s rough, right? Cause so much of Alyosha’s last arch was about finding rest. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Jack: And about what it means to put tools down.
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Um… so I’m cautious of being like, [amused] ‘What’s up Alyosha?’
Austin: Oh, I think that Janine meant for that ‘You find a body. Do people recognize who it is? What happened?’ Not for ‘someone returns.’
Jack: Mm. Actually, no. Uh, it’s Benjamin and Blue J. 
Austin: Okay. 
Jack: Um… it’s- it’s Benjamin walking first, his arms folded, crossed, walking through the like- the tall grass that grows out on some of the fields- the fields around the university. And then behind him, maybe like, five or six paces behind, comes Blue J. And they have been fighting. They haven’t been fighting… It becomes clear as they arrive that they haven’t been fighting about anything particularly earth-shattering- 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -or anything particularly irreparable. This does not feel like a fight that signals the end of anything other than not having fought like this before. 
Austin: [breathes a laugh] Is this the first time they fought like this?
Jack: Yes. It is. I- I think- We’ve seen them together onscreen for long enough that I imagine they’ve fought about other things in the past. 
Austin: Of course. Yeah. 
Jack: But I don’t think that they have fought before in such a way that one of them has been, you know, walking five paces ahead of the other with their arms folded. 
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: Um, and there’s gossip about it around the camp. And-
Keith: Oh, people will talk. [Ali laughs]
Jack: People will talk, and they do. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: And the gossip ranges from the fairly well-meaning and the fairly- What’s the word?- like, experienced.
Austin: Mhm. 
Jack: -of just like, ‘They’re a young couple.’ You know-
Austin: To?
Jack: To mean stuff. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: To like, ‘I never thought it was gonna work out. The children of Hadrian and Red Jack.’
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: ‘What were we expecting?’ And some of those people are just like- There’s definitely some glances across bar room tables when people hear that of just like, ‘What the fuck are you talking about? Shut up.’
Austin: Right. 
Jack: Um, and I think they explain, probably together and probably with some reluctance, that while they, you know, they still want to do this, they still want to go out into the world together, um and they’re committed to it, but it just got difficult and tempers were high. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: And it was very hard. And so, they’re just gonna come back. And they’re gonna take stock. And they’re gonna- they’re gonna take a moment to take stock. 
Austin: I have two questions. 
Jack: Yes. 
Austin: One is, what do they think of the bugs? What’s the first bug they see?
Jack: Oh god. The first bug they see is the… um… [laughs] It’s the praying mantises in the fields. 
Austin: Yeah, of course. 
Jack: As they come in through the- through the fields. And again, I want to be clear that this is not an- They are telling the truth-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -when they say that they don’t think this is irreparable. Um, and in that moment, I think, when they see four praying mantises scything at the fields, there’s this- there’s this shared moment of like, ‘Oh my god! Blue J!’
Austin: Right.
Jack: ‘Look at that!’ Um, and it’s kind of the- there’s a warmth there that they perhaps haven’t felt in a couple of days. But it’s- it’s a band-aid. Um, at least for the time being. But you know, it’s good to see a bug. 
Austin:  It’s good to see a bug. I have a second question. 
Keith: Couple of days? That’s a big fight.
Austin: How long is it before Blue J realizes that Red Jack is gone?
Jack: Instantly. Instantaneously. 
Austin: They just don’t feel him. Or they don’t see Ace. Or they…
Jack: It’s that, and it’s also, they want to see Red Jack. 
Austin: Yeah. 
[2:15:00]
Jack: They have been- You know, this is like, they’ve separated from their father who they care about very much. They’re in a time of- of real emotional unpleasantness. They’re like, ‘Where’s Red Jack? I- I want to be with my dad.’
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Uh, and he’s not there. And, of course-
Austin: And Throndir’s gone, too. 
Jack: Mhm. Mhm. 
Austin: They are left without either of their parental figures in this moment. 
Jack: And the person that- the person that Blue J wants to go to then is Benjamin.
Austin: Right. 
Jack: And I think they feel that very intently, and I think Benjamin feels that, too. But as is the way of these things, almost because of the- the ritual of the fight, the structure of the fight-
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: -this is not a soothing that either of them feels like they are able to take right now. 
Austin: They grow up so fast. [Ali laughs] This is some adult shit. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. I advance some clocks. I advance the Velas trip. Only two left on that. [Someone says, ‘Ooo.’] Galenica- Galenica will only be here for two more weeks. The new church has another seven weeks to go. And Throndir has another steps to look- six weeks- er sorry, five weeks left looking for Red Jack after this. What do you do with your turn, Lem?
Jack: Lem is going to sit down with Galenica over a series of meetings. He feels awful about this because it’s face-to-face contact with someone who he feels vaguely threatened by. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: Um, but what he wants to get to the bottom of is something close to what Adaire talked about when she said, ‘I’d like a model.’ Which is basically the sort of practical and ontological questions about what a reconfiguration would look like.
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: What does it mean to the people who are here? How far back? How far back are we going? In terms of like, how much are we thinking of this as putting things back to the way they were versus how much of it- are we thinking about restabilizing it in some way? How are the lamina going to be restitched together?
Austin: Right.
Jack: Are there going to be side effects?
Austin: Right. 
Jack: And I think the re- I think this is a four step clock. 
Austin: It is, which is interesting because they scheduled to leave in two weeks. Does that mean that- that Lem is going to travel with them for a little bit?
Jack: Mm. Yes. Absolutely. 
Austin: As maybe they go back to Alcyon or they go off the map. 
Jack: Mhm. 
Austin: Okay. 
Jack: Yeah, I think so. Um, and I think it’s- I think it’s four weeks because the vibe that I want to get for this are- [sighs] God. I’m- I live in the U.K. Brexit is a-
Austin: Mhm. 
Jack: -real thing. And a thing that we saw a lot during the like, early to mid to late days of Brexit were these like, unbelievably intense negotiations-
Austin: Mhm. 
Jack: -where Britain went in with absolutely nothing, and we were just torn apart by U.N. negotiators. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Um, and I just love this image of- of basically like, four weeks of, ‘Okay, we’re gonna sit down today, and we’re gonna try and talk about this, but we’re gonna end up talking about something else.’ And it's endless.
Austin: Completely like- I mean the thing that you find with Galenica is they immediately turn every question back to you. 
Jack: Right. 
Austin (as Galenica): What type of surface are we talking about here? Like, there are many sorts of surfaces. Which- which would you prefer?
Austin: You know? It’s like- [Keith groans ‘ugh’] there is a co-invest- There is a- a deliberate back- They are seeing this as an opportunity to sit and have some like, you know, deep anthropological study of you- 
Jack: Right, right, right, right. 
Austin: -and what your perspective is. Which is not necessarily helpful.
Jack: Nope. It’s not what Lem is sitting down to get. And I think that’s why it’s taking so long. [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah. Four weeks of hard conversation. Love it.
[Jack de Quidt’s “Under the Boughs” begins playing]
Ali: But Galenica will leave before that finishes? Or…
Austin: Yeah. Absolutely. 
Jack: I’m gonna go- I’m gonna go-
Austin: Galenica is due to leave in two weeks.
Jack: -with them. 
Ali: Alright.
Austin: Yeah. Lem is gonna walk with. That’s what it sounds like. Go on a roadtrip with a god. And we’ll talk about what that looks like next time probably. 
[music plays out to end]
