SPRING IN HIERON 29: DEEPER THAN FLESH
Transcriber: Cole
Austin (as Maelgwyn): Everything’s going fine… I hate this. No, I know it—I know this is gonna cause less harm... in the long run, but… [pause] Yeah, of course I love him, I love you both.
[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” begins playing in the background]
Austin: And it is Maelgwyn discussing with Samot the plan. Which is that he would be sent here to rise to prominence, and when Samot’s attack comes, betray Samothes and lead a bloodless coup. And there is something in you that thinks: “I bet that’s worth something.
---
Austin: I think Red Jack looks at you and says, like: 
Austin (as Red Jack): Do you wish to slip in, unnoticed? Or should I simply kick down the door?
----
Austin: There are ten people [Janine sighs] in hoods, surrounding the, um, bone dragon that you fought before? There are, besides those ten people immediately around it who are the cultists wearing, like, hoods, there are four other people in this room. And then yes, the red of the blood-sun is, is, y’know, slowly filling the room.
---
Austin: Samot and Severea enter the room. And Severea begins to like, lift her hand to do some cool divine magic shit, Samot’s eyes begin to light up; before either of them can act, the Solarch arrives from behind them, having stepped out of the chapel that the group didn’t check. Um, and it’s the Solarch. It’s the one you saw in that dream, um, and I think as he comes through there is just this blast of light and heat. And the gel on the dragon lights on fire.
[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” finishes playing to end]
Jack (as Snitch Nightly): What is that glove? 
Ali (as Castille): [laughs lightly] Yeah, it’s beautiful, isn’t it? 
Jack (as Snitch Nightly): What is it? 
Ali: [laughs] I don’t know how she’d describe it… 
Austin: Yeah. But it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter how she would describe it, what matters is how the dream would—the dream, which is the dream of someone who was seen it already, would backfill it. You know? 
Ali: Right. 
Jack: [laughs lightly] Right. 
Austin: And we don’t need her to do it. Right? 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: We don’t even need it. What we can go is like, “What is that glove?” And then it’s on his hand, and he is on his knees in front of Samothes the second, in front of Maelothes, in front of Maelgwyn as Samothes. And it is on his hand, and behind him is the armor of the Solarch. And Samothes, like, pinned to the bottom layer of existence, where somehow he has brought you, explains to you that… 
Austin (as Samothes): It is a strange thing to become someone new. Because you learn so much, Snitch Nightly. You learn so much that you could have never anticipated. 
Austin: And it isn’t made to you like an offer, but it is explained to you the way- [sighs] It- With a- with a plainness, the way that a new boss explains what your daily duties will be in your role. He tells you that you are to prepare the world for his return. And for what comes next for the inevitability of the Heat and the Dark. And asks you to stand and put the armor on. What do you do?
Jack (as Snitch Nightly): Well, I’m sure we can uh… I’m sure we can come to some sort of arrangement. 
Austin (as Samothes): [sighs] We already have.
Jack (as Snitch Nightly): Uh- other than that. 
Austin (as Samothes): Put on the armor.
Jack (as Snitch Nightly): It was twenty years ago. It was twenty years ago. 
Austin (as Samothes): It was my son. It was me. 
Jack (as Snitch Nightly): What? You think you’re special? A father and a son? [blows huff out dismissively] I’ve seen many fathers and sons go through what you’ve gone through. Hell, I’ve been invo- We can make some kind of an arrangement. We can make some kind of an arrangement here. What you’re being is- is- is- What you’re being is callous. And what you’re being is irresponsible. 
Austin: That like, grin that we know from this Samothes moves on his face, and he says, 
Austin (as Samothes): You were always so- [inhales and exhales] 
Austin: What is the descriptor he wants for fuckin’ Snitch Nightly? 
Austin (as Samothes): You were always so capable. You will make more arrangements in your life. So many more than you could ever count. And you will have followers. Many will report to you directly. Get in the armor. It is the final arrangement I will make with you. 
Austin: And his eyes glow that black-purple. And I don’t know that Lem has ever seen this Samothes. 
Jack: No, it’s-
Austin: It’s just so much worse even than the other Samothes you just saw. 
Jack: It’s so frightening. It’s- [laughs] The- the impression I think that Lem gets is just like, oh my god, something’s wrong with Samothes. 
Austin: [laughs] What happened to him?
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: But oh right, yeah, I know what happened, but still. 
Jack: Yeah, just like- like for someone who’s seen the whole story, they are able to- what’s the word- compartmentalize-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -their understanding of the narrative beats. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: But for Lem, who has- who has just seen this in like, fits and starts, it is so difficult for him to look at this figure and- and think of it as something other than Samothes. It looks like Samothes. It has- speaks with Samothes’s voice. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Um, yeah. 
Austin: And I don’t- again, we don’t see what gets him into the armor. But we see him in the armor and on the other side of the Marieldan river. 
Jack: I think actually we- maybe we get a little. 
Austin: What do- what do you want to show? Is he kicking and screaming? Is he willing? Is he-?
Jack: I think that when- I think Lem has this out of body sense that you get in dreams sometimes-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: -when you- when you see yourself and you are yourself acting. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: And I think Lem sees his eyes light up at the understanding that in one way or another, he is being offered another curtain. 
Austin: Mm. Yeah. That is exactly it. 
Jack: There is a reading of this whether or not it’s a correct reading, but I think that- that there is a reading of this where he thinks to himself, ‘Alright. Ok. There’s a- there’s a- I just have to hold on through this bit. This bit is gonna be unpleasant.’ [Austin laughs quietly in the background and groans] ‘I just have to hold on through this bit. And then I can just get right back to it. And maybe even- maybe I can- maybe I can- maybe I can make it bigger. And maybe I can make it better.’ Um, it’s that sort of like, ‘well, how long is forever?’-
Austin: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack: -thinking. And so I think that there is a- there is a conniving spark in the eyes of the man who lowers the visor-
Austin: Right. 
Jack: -of the- of the suit of armor- of the Solarch’s armor. 
Austin: And [exhales] he does have a curtain. Um, and- and a justification and a- [sighs] an immediate set of priorities to pursue because at this moment, even so far away, the new Samothes seeks to conquer the world. And he sets off via the Solarch to do that. And it’s, you know, villages on fire. It’s uh, a new army of pala-din marching across the southern lands. It’s a dragon in the sky. The Advocate. Burning the world. 
Jack: I have a question. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: Amid this, is there also smuggling? And-
Austin: Sure. Yeah. 
Jack: -people turning a blind eye? 
Austin: This is- this is the Creed, right? This is- Samothes didn’t come up with the Creed of Samothes. 
Jack: Right. Right. 
Austin: Not this Samothes. Fuckin’ the Solarch did. ‘I know what we can do.’ Right? ‘A- a church in every town.’
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: ‘Burn the village. Send the priest after. Help them rebuild.’ 
Jack: Yeah, the priest will show up.
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: What is a tithe, you know?
Austin: [light laugh] Right. Exactly.
Jack: And you know, sometimes a boat with some people on that we’re a little concerned about will just go down in the water outside the city. 
Austin: Right. Right. [overlapped] Well, and I think it’s-
Jack: We’ll be able to see it sink. So, you know that something’s happened. 
Austin: Right. But-
Jack: But uh, nobody can quite pin who did it. And even if they could, it’s that extra level where like, who would say? Who would say that- that uh, this figure was responsible?
Austin: Right. Well, so I think- I actually do think there’s a specific thing that shifts the mode in that direction which is- You know, I imagine the two actually bicker at some point about what the better strategy is. But Samothes is Samothes. And so you- you try the loud way first. You devastate the countryside. You try to bring about the Heat and the Dark, but it's not time yet. And the Advocate- this dragon is killed, which leads you to- and I- I think we see it happen. And it’s like, it’s not the way you like to work. You don’t like to ride a dragon into battle at this point. 
Jack: [light laugh] No.
Austin: [light laugh] Right?
Jack: Right. 
Austin: You do it because you have to. You’re com- you are compelled to at this point. Um, but you find resistance eventually. There are people who stand against you. People who’ve left Marielda and know sort of what you are. People with powerful weapons, right? And I think we get- we get Tamsyn uh, slash Claret fighting you. We get- finally, we get the death of- of the- the Advocate at the hands of Red Jack. Um, I think we even get you killing Red Jack. Again in this montage of just destruction mixed with the slow creeping kind of uh, societal plan- 
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: -instead of the military one. And you kill Red Jack with the Blade in the Dark. This is why he got in there that time. 
Jack: Yeah. Cause-
Austin: This is how he knows who you are. 
Jack: Cause I would have access to it at this point. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or would have claimed it. Would have found it. Would have stolen it, right? And then lost it at some point, presumably in some other encounter. Who knows? But in the- in the time between- you know, after los- after the- the Advocate is destroyed the first time, all those years ago just as the Erasure was taking over- And it is- is again, one of the elements of the Erasure. When you look at the book- when you look at books, when you read what the Erasure is, when you hear stories, and they say, ‘oh, yeah. There was an apocalyptic dragon that came and killed everybody.’ Like, ok, well that was part of it. Like [light laugh] uh-
Jack: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Austin: This wasn’t the- The Erasure wasn’t that dragon in the same way that it wasn’t just you know, uh, the wars between the- you know, snow elves and the goblins or whatever it was. Like, there’s all those different things that combine into what the Erasure, the period of time that we now know as the Erasure, was, but one of them literally was this thing. Um, but afterwards the Solarch takes the lead in a sense and brings Samothes over into this mode of- of creeping and- and uh, kind of quiet control and building resources over centuries instead of over days or through- through connections instead of conquest, right?
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: And now he’s here in the room with you all. Uh, not with you Lem, who is- who’s hand is being held very closely by your boyfriend because you’re sweating and it’s- it’s rough. It’s rough for you right now. Um, there is a new person here in this room. I linked a good picture of something once, and I can’t find that same picture anymore, and I feel bad about it. But that’s ok. It was like a cool golden knight, right?
Ali: Oh yeah. 
Austin: I can’t find it. I’m gonna post this other one instead. It’s fine. [sighs] Uh, so what do we got? We got a Solarch. We got a pala-din- gargoyle pala-din. 
Ali: Mm. 
Austin: We got one, two, three, four, five cultists left. We got a bone dragon, who isn’t moving, but who is now on fire. We got uh- some dead bodies. We got a Collector-Curator. We got a couple gods. Maybe I mentioned that. Um, we got uh- a death knight and a thief. 
[0:15:00]
Ali: Mm. 
Austin: Who does a thing?
Janine: Um, I have a thing that I want to do.
Austin: Yeah? What do you want to do?
Janine: Um… the thing that I want to do is um, use one of my fear daggers. 
Austin: Mm. 
Ali: Mm.
Janine: Because you know, I just kind of feel like Kall Fer has it a little too together right now. 
Austin: Yeah, fair. 
Janine: Uh, and I would like to cause some problems in that area. 
Austin: The fear area. 
Janine: Yes. 
Austin: Ok. Uh, give me a Volley. If you’re throwing it. I’m guessing you’re throwing it?
Janine: Yes. Yeah.
Austin: Volley is DEX, so 2d6 plus four cause you have the three plus a one forward. That’s a- Oh, I thought you already rolled. Ok. [small gasp] Only a seven. 
Janine: Plus one, but that’s still. 
Austin: Yeah. You on- You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger. You- uh, you have a choice of these rather. Sorry. ‘Deal your damage. Choose one. You have to move to get the shot. You have to take what you can get minus 1d6 damage. Or you have to take several shots reducing your ammo by one.’
Janine: Um… 
Austin: How many of these do you have? Ah, you have three. 
Janine: I have three. Yeah. 
Austin: You are at three ammo, yeah. 
Janine: Yeah. I’m- I think I’m gonna do the one that sacrifices the damage cause damage is not the purpose. 
Austin: The goal. Ok, so do your damage, but then also subtract 1d6 from it.
Janine: Um, how do I do damage on- Is it just damage-damage?
Austin: It’s just your- it’s just damage-damage. Yeah, it’s your class damage, so d8. [light laugh] Well… so zero damage. 
Janine: Well, ok. 
Austin: You rolled a one, so-
Janine: Yeah. This- No, that’s no damage. That’s fine. 
Austin: Yeah. Uh huh. No damage. But you do catch- you do catch her with the- the fear effect um, which is a mediocre video game series. But what they do- what it does is ‘so long as they remain in- within proximity to the dagger, their reaction is up to them. Flee, panic, beg, fight.’ Um, I think she… God, how committed is she to this? Um, I think she’s panicking at this point. She isn’t gonna not commit, but what she does is disengage from Red Jack and like, basically move to the dragon and is like, looking in every direction, but is not contributing at this point, you know? Um, so yeah. You’ve- you have at least kind of made some space for Red Jack to breathe and maybe clean up these cultists and hopefully deal with the Solarch who is here now. Hey, Hella, you’re pretty close to all that other shit. You’re kind of between the Solarch and this gargoyle. 
Ali: Yeah, um-
Austin: What’s your play?
Ali: It’s tough cause I- I was thinking that like, this is not the moment that Hella’s gonna be like, ‘oh, I’m gonna look at these gods and see what they’re gonna do.’ [Austin laughs lightly] Um, and at like- I- It’s- it’s impossible for her not to move to the Solarch after having a weird sleepwalking dream about them, right?
Austin: Yeah. Yeah.
Ali: [light laugh] Where she just like, immediately like, ‘Oh, you’re the problem.’ 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: ‘Thanks for coming here because I wanted to kill you.’ [Austin and Ali laugh quietly] Um-
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: So, yeah. I think she just- she moves in. I um… [exhales] Oh, I don’t know. [laughs] 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: I don’t know how to describe like, starting combat, but um-
Austin: I mean I think he just like has that one gauntlet out- has the gauntlet out and then draws this blade of fire which you recognize as being very similar to the one Hadrian used to have. 
Ali: Oh, you don’t say. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: I hated that sword too. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: [laughs] Great. Um, yeah. En garde. Let’s go. I have a sword, too. [laughs] 
Austin: [laughs lightly] You just charge in?
Ali: Yeah. [laughs] 
Austin: Alright. Give me a Hack and Slash. Let’s fuckin’ do it. 
Ali: Sure. Yeah, let’s get it done. I was like, ‘Oh, I could look at them, and the Solarch could flinch,’ but like, that’s not happening. I don’t care. This is a fight. [Austin laughs] 
Austin: You can do whatever you want, honestly. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Uh, that’s a nine, but did you- Oh, you already spent your plus one forward. Is that true?
Ali: I stepped- spent it when I came in, right?
Austin: Yeah, you spent it when you came in. Yeah. 
Ali: It bumped the twelve up to a thirteen. 
Austin: So- so it is a nine. So, deal damage to the enemy. The enemy makes an attack against you. Give me your damage. 
Ali: Love to. Um-
Austin: So d10 plus-
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Do you get any pluses on this? I don’t remember. 
Ali: I don’t know that I still have my plus one that was like, ‘oh, you just hurt people really bad’ cause I-
Austin: Uh, yeah. You do. Plus one piercing. Yeah. Uh hm. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: So, 2d6 plus- er sorry. Not 2d6. Uh, d- d10 plus one. 
Ali: Ok, I’m just rolling d10, then we can plus the one. So, that’s four. 
Austin: Oh my god. So, four? Ok. Um-
Ali: [laughs] It’s fine. 
Austin: Yikes. 
Ali: It’s fine. 
Austin: Uh, no it like- it- it clanks off the side of- Like, you like, full-strength boom down on his shoulder, and it just like, clips into a part of the armor and like, gets stuck there for a second. And he does [typing] best of 2d10 plus four- 
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: -damage. 
Janine: Yikes.
Austin: Ignores armor. 
Janine: Dope. 
Austin: Uh, so the- Wow, he rolled two nines. [Janine groans in the background] So, uh- so nine plus four is thirteen damage. 
Ali: Uh, Divine Intervention, please. [Jack and Ali laugh lightly]
Austin: What’s that do?
Ali: [aughs] Um I- Ok, ‘spend two peace when you-’
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: ‘-or an Ali takes takes damage.’ [small laugh] Did I say Ali instead of ally?
Austin: You did say Ali. 
Janine: You did. [laughs] 
Austin: [laughing] You did. [Ali laughs] 
Jack: Ali has taken damage. 
Austin: It is Ali, in the world. You or any Ali. [Austin laughs lightly; Ali continues laughing] You are really tight with Adelaide. Wow. This book just went and it said to anyone in the world, ‘Hey, whenever an Ali takes damage-.’
Ali: Uh, [laughs] ‘takes damage to call on your deity who intervenes with an appropriate manifestation and negates the damage.’ 
Austin: Wow, so you just get to spend the- How much peace do you have?
Ali: I have three. 
Austin: Alright, so you’re gonna spend two of it here to just ignore this thirteen damage. Hell yeah. What’s this look like? What is the- what is the appropriate- So, like, your sword gets stuck, and what he was gonna do was just like, take this fire blade and just like, run it slowly across your- your chest, you know?
Ali: That, yeah. 
Austin: Just like, ‘I’m cutting you.’ Um, [light laugh] what do you to- What does Adelaide do to stop this? [exhales] Like, is this- is this the moment where she literally shows up as a fuckin’ Jojo stand? [Ali laughs] Like from behind you with like- like slides past you and just like, lowers the sword basically?
Ali: Um- [overlapped] that’d be cool. 
Austin: Is there something- is there- Is it about- [exhales] God, does it counter the Heat and the Dark stuff somehow? Do pearls appear somewhere? [Ali laughs] How dope would that be? God, it would actually-
Ali: Um, that- that all sounds pretty dope. Yeah. 
Austin: That would pretty dope if yeah, like as he like, slides it across your chest and like, should be cutting through the armor, as the sword moves past what happens is like, pearls bubble up. [Ali laughs] Pearls and opals bubble up in its place. Um, giving this like, rad streak of- of pearls and opals across where there should be this slash of blood. Um, and I think you know, he laughs because he’s a villain. He does like, the Dark Souls like, ‘ha ha ha ha ha.’ And uh, takes another step forward.
Janine: And then asks for your money. 
Austin: Yeah. [laughs] Yeah. [Ali laughs] Exactly. Exactly. Uh, in this moment, the gargoyle was like, prepping to like, jump on you also, and Samot lifts up a hand and from the bottom to the top, he gets unravelled into star stuff and is gone. 
Ali: Oh. 
Janine: Cool. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Thanks for getting out of bed, Samot. [laughs] 
Austin: Uh huh. Uh huh. I think actually some of the cultists want to put him back to bed. Uh, and so the three nearest to him, they slip out like, little vials of the captured Heat and the Dark- the stuff that they were giving to Uklan Tel, and they pull them out these like, belt pouches and they throw them at his feet, which causes two things. One, the star stuff in his body suddenly starts to glow extra bright as it reacts to the presence of the Heat and the Dark. And then two, he recoils from it, and he can’t- I guess the fire erupts all around him, and so he can’t actually help you directly in this moment. And uh- a third thing that happens which is between this fire and the fire on the dragon, Severea decides that she needs to try to cool things down. 
And so, she likes, claps her hands together and you can hear the sound of thunder begin to- to come in from above and rain kicks off. She’s bringing in the rain to try to pour in, but the tarp is in the way. And so the tarp doesn’t like, let it all the way come in. And then the wind picks up. She’s trying to like, lift the tarp out of the way so more of the rain can get in. And I think she buys you a little bit more time. The fire is still growing, both on the dragon and around uh, Samot, but it’s growing a little more slowly. Um, we are getting there. The red has just about filled this room. We need big action here. 
Ali: We do need a big action. Um, god. Is there a way to coordinate-
Janine: Is someone wearing a suspicious ring? That we could take off and then it’s just fine?
Austin: The Solarch. The Solarch is-
Janine: Oh right. Right. Yeah.
Austin: Solarch is wearing the ring. Yeah. 
Ali: Oh, the Solarch has it on. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Ali: You don’t say. 
Austin: Uh huh. Yeah. 
Ali: Um, ok. A best thing to do is do like, a three stream attack with these two gods, right?
Austin: [laughs lightly] Uh huh. 
Ali: That’s like, the way that this should go?
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Five stream if Adaire [laughs] and Red Jack
Austin: Uh huh. And Red Jack. Yeah, totally. 
Janine: I don’t- I don’t honestly know what I can do to help, but I’m willing to try. [laughs] 
Austin: I mean you killed half this room. [light laugh] 
Ali: Yeah. 
Janine: I’m good at soft- the soft ones. 
Austin: Yeah. Uh hm. 
Janine: This dude is- Solarch is not soft. [light laugh] 
Austin: No. That’s true.
Ali: Not soft, yeah. 
Janine: There is no soft there at all.
Ali: Um, yeah. [laughs] My obvious thing is like, ‘Oh, we have to remove the ring. Cut this guy’s arm off.’ [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. That is what you need to do. Or that would help. That would do this. 
Ali: Yeah, that would give us some time at the very least. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Um, but I mean what’s the-
Austin: How would you do that?
Ali: Yeah. What’s the positioning in the room like- Severea’s doing the rain thing. Samot just killed that person. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Um- is the Solarch- like, is the Solarch looking past me in any way or like, ‘I’m gonna kill this person’-
Austin: No, I think- I think the Solarch- You have the Solarch’s attention. 
Ali: Ok, um- I can roll better this time. [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah. You don’t want to use any of your other shit?
Ali: I’m looking at what I have- I- I have like- I’m having that like, Final Fantasy beating a boss thing where it’s like, ‘oh, I’m not even gonna use the fear spell cause it’s gonna be [laughs] immune to it cause it’s a boss at the end of this dungeon.’
Austin: Right. Right. It’s a very powerful being, but like, I’m not gonna say you can’t roll- I will tell you before you roll if it’s a- if it’s a thing that you shouldn’t do or if like, if you go to do it. You know what I mean?
Ali: Right. Yeah. 
Austin: At this point. 
Ali: Um, let me do Road to Perdition cause I… I have Unholy hower- Power in my Dark Blade, and I might as well use it while I’m here. 
Austin: So, what’s that do? What are you- what are you- It’s a charisma roll, right?
Ali: Yes. 
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: Um, yeah. Let’s roll it and see what I get. Then I’ll decide what I’m-
Austin: Alright. [thinking noise] chu-chu-chu So, 2d6 plus- Oh my god. 
Ali: Oh. [laughs] 
Austin: That’s a four. [Ali sighs] This is why you roll Hack and Slash. [laughs] 
Ali: Too bad. [playfully] Fuck off. 
Austin: No, I’m just sayin’- This is like- Yeah. Um- [exhales] the- Fwoof. God. [Ali laughs] Uh, what- So, what’s it look like when you try to draw on the- Oh, I- You know, I think that the thing that happens here is pretty obvious. Which is the Solarch uh- You go to do the Road to Perdition. Your eyes turn black or whatever. You can feel Adelaide reaching through you and giving you power. Um, and then the dragon behind you roars and all of the- all of the sound leaves the room, and it like, snaps that magical connection briefly. And then the chains on its front two legs snap as it’s becoming the thing it is due to become. The Advocate. And it, with its front legs free, swings at you. Let me look up its stats really quick. It’s not one hundred percent there yet, but it’s front half is the thing. 
Ali: Uh hm. 
Jack: Is this thing worse as the Advocate than it was when we tried to fight it?
Austin:  Oh, Jack. 
Janine: How could it not be? [laughs] 
Jack: Well, I didn’t know if like- it was in a sort of nascent stage. 
Janine: What would this process be about if it wasn’t worse? Ugh. 
Jack: Just like, a kind of nascent, you know-
Austin: Uh, so it’s best of 2d- 2d12. 
Jack: Oh Jesus. 
Austin: So, five plus nine. Four piercing. So that is uh, fourteen with four piercing. How much armor do you have?
Ali: I have three. 
Austin: So, it pierces all that armor. Take fourteen damage. 
Ali: Oh, so I just go down to six. 
Austin: You just go down to six as it’s claw reaches out and like, slams into your back. Um, and you turn and face it. And- er like, it- as it hits you, it is like- [foley of breath] You feel that same feeling of smallness from when you were in camp and everyone was- was scared of the blood sun, right? Like, it makes you feel- it produces that same exact effect of futility and smallness and like- ‘Ok, how do I begin to address this thing?’ You don’t give up. You’re not- You’re fuckin’ Hella Varal. [Ali laughs] But like, that same feeling flows back in through you. 
Ali: Also, this thing is so capable of hurting me. [laughs] 
Austin: Oh- oh yeah. 
Ali: And that helps. Just being like- 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: ‘Oh right. I’m not good at this apparently now. Oops.’
Austin: This thing is the hardest thing I think anyone has ever fought in this game. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: By far. But- [Janine groans and Ali laughs] You know. There are worse things that could happen. 
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: I guess. Uh, I should delete the gargoyle. There. Bye. Or the gargoyle pala-din rather. Adaire? 
Janine: Yeah?
Austin: I’m coming back to you. What are you doin’?
Janine: Hooray. Um, Can I be invisible again at this point or is invisibility foiled for good?
Austin: Your invisibility is foiled for good in this room. 
Janine: Ok.
Austin: They know you’re here, and they’re-
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: They’re- You know, the apocalypse dragon, The Advocate, has supernatural knowledge.

Austin (cont.): The Solarch is- has like, very similar sorts of like, piercing- piercing true shit, you know? Um-
Janine: Yeah, that’s fair. Um-
Austin: You could roll to do it is what I would say. Is it like- If you could… it’s very hard to like, successfully become invisible again once people know you’re around, you know? But [exhales] No- I- yeah, I don’t- I think it’s not- I don’t think it’s feasible.
Janine: Well, I mean the last time I did the invisibility stuff, I was popping in and out like crazy, that’s why I asked. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. 
Janine: Cause it was- but that was also a very different situation. 
Austin: It was a much different group of people, you know?
Janine: Yeah. Yeah. Um, ok. I need to look at the difference between applied and the other kind of poison. It doesn’t tell me in the info thing. That’s an important thing that it should tell me. [Austin laughs lightly] It just says ‘applied.’ Um-
Austin: What are the- what’s- what’s the other type called?
Janine: I don’t remember. 
Austin: Ok. Uh, applied is ‘when carefully applied to a person or to something they eat or drink.’
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, touch would be it’s used by touching the target’s skin. Um-
[crosstalking]
Janine: Or a weapon, right? That’s- the other one is the one is the one that you can put on a weapon? Yeah.
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. For weapon- Yes. Yeah. Totally.
Janine: Ok. Um, well it was worth- [sighs]
Austin: Yes. 
Janine: It was worth checking. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: Uh, this sucks. Ok. [laughs] Um, I think- Uh… I think that I need to… Hmm. God, this is such a bad situation for Adaire at this point. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: Uh, Adaire’s incredibly squishy. One hit from almost anything in this room could kill me. 
Austin: The cultists are probably whatever, but everything else is pretty rough. 
Janine: Yeah. I- I’m- I don’t know if the cultists are important-
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: -in terms of like,  is that where the energy goes? Are they just- They're just kind of there. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Janine: Um, versus the other things which are a little trickier. Uh… ok. I think that I’m going to go for Kall Fer. 
Austin: Ok. Who is panicking. 
Janine: Yeah.
Austin: If you Defy Danger Dex, you can- this can be a backstab. 
Janine: I- I would like to try that.
Austin: Yeah, let’s- let’s go with that then. That means you have to- again have to kind of get in without being seen-
Janine: Uh huh. 
Austin: -or get past the- the- I mean also it’s like sli- What you’re really doing here is sliding between the legs of this newly forming apocalypse dragon. The Advocate.
Janine: I rodeoed that dragon’s body before, so I’m probably familiar with how its legs move.
Austin: Yeah. But it’s- Yes. Yes. 
Janine: I don’t know. [laughs] 
Austin: Yes, fair. That is true. 
Janine: I’m going putting out here. I’m definitely not rodeying- rodeoing it again. That’s-
Austin: That’s a ten. 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: That’s a one and a six. 
Janine: Yeah, that- that one scared me. I’ll be honest. It’s the only one I saw.
Austin: So yeah. So, you get through. Uh, you can go ahead and use backstab. Again, you can deal damage as- as you want to or you can roll to do that extra as- as normal with backstab. 
Janine: I’m gonna roll. 
Austin: Only a seven this time. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: Which means you only get to pick one of these bonuses. 
Janine: Uh, I’m going to choose to not get into melee with them. 
Austin: Does that mean like, you roll back out of the way? What’s that mean in this case?
Janine: I think I- Yeah, I think this is a like-
Austin: Like a ninja?
Janine: Oh man. I-
Austin: Like run past, stab?
Janine: This is really cheesy, but I feel like this is maybe the moment to do it. It’s still super hot, right?
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: Adaire’s been running around this room stabbing people. [exhales]
Austin: [light laugh] Uh huh. 
Janine: A lot. I imagine she’s quite bloody. [aughs] 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: And like, sweaty. Um, I think like, the moment before this, Adaire pulls off her gloves. Chucks them to the ground. Rolls up her sleeves. And I think- uh, Adaire’s forearms are conspicuously covered with stuff. There are tattoos. 
Austin: Hell yeah. 
Janine: There are burns. Like- like brand marks. 
Austin: Mm. 
Janine: There is scarification. There’s- there’s like a lot of- there’s a lot of stuff. And it’s a mix of like, some things are obviously like, ‘oh, this is what happens in a place when you steal a thing.’
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: They put this mark on the back of your hand. 
Austin: Right. 
Janine: Some of it- Um, a lot of those marks have a companion kind of beside them that looks more deliberate. 
Austin: Uh hm.
Janine: Like a tattoo of like, a really cool building or something like that. But this is like, from knuckles to elbows, which is where her sleeves are- are rolled to. 
Austin: Right. 
Janine: Um, and I think-
Austin: Also, when the gloves hit the ground, they go [foley] ‘poom’ because they’re weighted gloves. [Austin and Janine laugh] 
Janine: Uh huh. Right. And that done, she- you know, she gets- she gets kind of low and runs in to- to make a good stab and then immediately sort of leap back. 
Austin: Yeah. Cool. Give me your-
Janine: So, then-
Austin: -your damage, and then plus 1d6. And then tell me what the other bonus you’re getting is. 
Janine: I only get the one, right? Which is the no melee. 
Austin: Oh right. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: Uh, so yeah. Give me your- whatever your damage would end up being. 
Janine: That’s an eight. 
Austin: Uh, alright. That’s an eight. That’s not bad. Where is she at? I think you like, you catch her- I mean, uh, you know, Red Jack has already done some good damage. I think the best- the most important thing you do here? She again, kind of like- you do that low attack, so she kind of falls and stutters and like- er stumbles and like, drops to a knee briefly and then brings it up- back up, but- and you didn’t even hit her here, but like, when you push through the magical armor she has, all those little bobbles and bells crack, and like, the vest that she has on just like, falls to the ground.
The enchantment broken. So, her armor is gone, and she is fairly weak. And I actually think um- God, I think at that point, she like cuts and runs. She’s like, stumbling and stumbling like, past the dragon and past some of the cultists. I think actually she like, taps one of the cultists on- on their shoulder and is like- the two of them begin to try to book it out the- the side hallway, basically. 
Janine: Load your fuckin’ gun, Callowkeen. 
Austin: Uh huh. [light laugh] Um, [inhales and exhales] god. I- [exhales] It’s gonna come down to whatever happens right now with this fuckin’ dragon and the Solarch. Also, Lem? You are looking at Hella Varal in front of you.
Jack: Oh. 
Austin: This is part of the eight. 
Jack: Oh. Hm. 
Austin: You’re not in control. 
Jack: No. 
Austin: But you’re here. You’re present. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: Oh, it’s scary. [laughs] 
Jack: Uh huh. I- Yeah, I imagine. I imagine. This is a situation that Lem uh, would try very hard to avoid. And also beyond the fear of it. I think there’s just this- this outright thing of like, ‘oh god. Is the Solarch going to kill Hella?’
Austin: Right. [Jack sighs] Good question. 
Jack: Is there anything I can do? Is there any way I can act?
Austin: I don’t know. Is there?
Jack: I don’t think- I think it would be dishonest to… try and turn an eight-
Austin: I would say like- let’s- let’s just- Totally. But like, let’s look at the sheet to make sure there isn't something- that you have anything that would be-
Jack: My sheet or the Solarch’s?
Austin: You sheet. Your sheet.
Jack: Ok. Uh, let’s see. Let’s see. Do I have anything for if I’m accidentally possessing the sword arm of a- a hundred year old cult? [Austin laughs] Um…
Austin: Ugh. Hey, the sword arm and the brains. 
Jack: [laughs] Yeah, exactly. 
Austin: I do think there is something here that you get in being here in this moment. Which is like, all this time has passed, and I think the ambition is gone. The ambition in the sense of like- you know, I described him in the first shot as being like, hungry, gangly, and ambitious. And it’s a different sort of ambition now. It’s- it’s nihilistic. It’s-
Jack: Right.
Austin: There’s nothing… Especially with Maelgwyn dead now again. Or- or his Samothes gone. It’s like-
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: In some ways it’s like, the leash has come off. And in others, he’s like- it’s just like, ‘just end it. Just- Let’s just wrap it up.’ You know? Um-
Jack: I don’t have anything. I don’t have-
Austin: No.
Jack: I- I have access to- 
Austin: Mm. 
Jack: -none of my inventory.
Austin: I- I would-
Janine: You’re a bard. You have to be able to- to- [exhales]
Austin: Do some bard shit.
Janine: -music. I don’t know. Music’s weird. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Janine: Music’s magic. 
Ali: I would- I would love to be communicated with in this moment. [laughing]
Austin: Uh huh. Um, looking at it, the things that I’m looking at are like, Aid-Interfere. 
Jack: Yeah, I was thinking about that. 
Austin: Is there a way for you to just distrac- Like, is this a two-way street, in some way?
Jack: Well, we know that the Solarch has sort of capabilities around this right?
Austin: Yeah. The Solarch sent you that first dream to taunt you, basically, right? To- to kind of call- call his shot. We know that the Solarch has effectively- whether it’s because they have Samol’s bones, and Samol used to be in charge of dreams, or because-
Jack: Mm. 
Austin: -this is part of what the Solarch is himself, there is a degree to which he can deliver visions and deliver prophecy, deliver dreams. 
Jack: Yeah. [exhales] So, there’s Aid- Aid or Interfere. 
Austin: There’s Aid or Interfere. There’s Metal Hurlant. ‘When you shout with great force or play a shattering note choose a target,’ um, which could be fun because that’s just like- Is that just you wake up shouting?
Jack: Oh, yeah. I was gonna say. Yeah. We could absolutely do that. And- and that could be Lem kind of ejecting from the-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: You ever had a nightmare that you have recognized is a bad nightmare, and you’ve made the conscious-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -and uh- it takes effort. Some- sometimes it happens very easily, but sometimes you’re like- [light laugh] Sometimes I will find myself going like, ‘well, I’ve had quite enough of this.’ [laughs] And-
Austin: Mm. [Ali laughs] 
Jack: -and try really hard to wake myself up. [Austin laughs lightly] And I wonder if kind of that is what Lem is- is trying here. Um, and the effect of it is- is Metal Hurlant. I mean, something we know about pattern magic is it has to be um- if you're performing sort of spells like this, they have to be intentional. The pattern can be unintentional, but I think if you’re like-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -’I’m gonna do-’ Otherwise it robs the agency of people when they make these decisions, I think. I think you have to intend to do this um, one way or another. 
Austin: Right. And you don’t think this is a moment where that’s changing for Lem or something. That is a thing that could be happening if that was something you, the player, were interested in. Do you know what I mean?
Jack: Yeah. I don’t think that-
Austin: We’re in that sort of late game space, but I don’t know that that’s something you want to-
Jack: I don’t think that that’s necessarily the- the arc that I’m super interested in. 
Austin: Yeah, yeah. I’m with you. 
Jack: But I think- Yeah, so I think rather than it being Lem is trying to wake himself up and accidentally performing Metal Hurlant, I think Lem is intentionally performing Metal Hurlant with the knowledge that it- it might have the side effect of waking him up.
Austin: Right. Right. 
Jack: So, the way this works is ‘when you shout with great force or play a shattering note, choose a target.’ In this case, I’m trying to target the Solarch. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: Um, ‘on a ten plus, the target takes 1d10 damage and is deafened for a few minutes.’ That’s very funny because of the way the Solarch kind of acts with light and sound. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. 
Jack: And also with the dragon in the room. Uh, ‘on a seven to nine, the target takes 1d10 damage and is deafened for a few minutes, but it’s out of control. The GM will choose an additional target nearby.’ I hate this. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: I hate this cause there’s no good person that this- If it hits-
Austin: It could hit the Advocate, right? Who could say?
Jack: Sure. But if it hits-
Austin: It won’t.
Janine: Mm. 
Jack: If it hits Hella , it’s bad.
Austin: Hella or Samo- or Samot. Or anything. 
Jack: If it hits- if it hits Emmanuel back in the room, it’s bad. 
Austin: Sure. Sure. 
Jack: Um, however, the uh- I love this as a sort of uh, play on the urban myth about waking sleepwalkers- 
Austin: Oh yeah, that’s really good. [Janine laughs lightly]
Jack: -and the danger involved there. So, I’m actually- I’m horrified by the thought of it going wrong, but it is fun to me. [Austin and Jack laugh] 
Austin: Give me a Constitution roll. 
Jack: Friends at the Table. 
Austin: Yeah. [laughs] 2d6 plus uh, zero, it looks like to me. 
Jack: Yeah, I’m just making sure that I’m not- Yeah. So, I can just hit Metal Hurlant. I can just push the button. 
Austin: You can. You just hit the button. [exhales] Hey, it’s a success.
Jack: Ok. 
Austin: It’s an eight. Phoo- phoo. 
Jack: I mean-
Austin: Give me the 1d10. 
Jack: -it’s still out of control. 
Austin: It is. And I will choose an additional target nearby. 
Jack: Roll 1d6- Ten. 
Austin: Nope. Ten. [Austin and Jack laugh quietly] [Jack types and laughs hard] [Ali and Janine laugh and sigh] Oh my fucking god. Lem King, everybody. 
Ali: [quietly] Thanks for your help. 
Jack: [still lightly laughing] Lem just wakes up going, ‘Oh.’ [Ali and Janine laugh] 
Janine: [sighs] Oh. 
Jack: I rolled a one. 
Austin: Uh huh. You rolled a one. You did one damage. It pierces armor because it’s not like you're hitting him. And you spring up in bed screaming. [Ali begins groaning] Um, Hella, it’s you. You take one and also are deafened for a few minutes. 
Jack: [quietly] I’m sorry.
Ali: Wait, I’m taking damage?
Austin: You’re taking-
Jack: I’m sorry. 
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh huh. It’s out of control. The GM will choose an additional target nearby. You’re the closest target. Um, it like, reverberates through the armor of the Solarch. The- So, you take one and are deafened also, which you know, maybe won’t even come into- into the situation here. Um, back in- one second, really quick. Lem, Emmanuel is like, squeezing your hand. You’ve squeezed his hand back as you wake up very hard. But he is ok. Um, and he like, leans forward and puts a hand on your back. 
Austin (as Emmanuel): Are you alright?
Jack (as Lem): Yeah, I think I hurt Hella. But like, a very small amount at a really bad time. 
Austin (as Emmanuel): Shh. Shh. Sh. 
Jack (as Lem): Like, I don’t think she’s in danger because of-
Austin (as Emmanuel): You’ve been here the whole time. Shh. It’s fine. Sit. Sit. 
Jack (as Lem): The Solarch. 
Austin (as Emmanuel): I know. 
Jack (as Lem): He’s in- He’s-
Austin (as Emmanuel): Or I don’t- I don’t know anything, but-
Jack (as Lem): He’s in the- The Solarch is in the- They’ve gone, and the Solarch is there, I think the dragon is also there as well, but it looks like slimier. 
[0:45:00]
Austin (as Emmanuel): Ok. 
Austin: I think he- [laughs hard; Ali laughs, too]
Austin (as Emmanuel): Ok, it’s sli- 
Austin: He gets a wash cloth that has like, some warm water and like puts it to your head. 
Austin (as Emmanuel): Shh. Lay down. [Jack/Lem exhales] Take a breath. 
Jack: Lem just like, settles back onto the bed.
Austin: Yeah. And I- he’s like, ‘ok.’ Um, I think he like, sings a song quietly to you as you like, lean back. Just like, half-humming, half-singing. Just something that you both like. 
Jack: And I think maybe Lem like, falls asleep. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Um, in the same that like, that was not genuine sleep- 
Austin: No. 
Jack: -that Lem experienced. 
Austin: You were not resting. 
Jack: It had none of the benefits of sleep. It was not- [lightly laughs] It was- it was fake sleep.
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Uh, and I think that in this moment, whether or- You know, in part for feeling that he’s in a safe place for this time being, but also just because his body is so exhausted. Just- just drifts away to a genuine sleep. 
Austin: Yeah. [exhales] Um, the room is- the room is silent for you, Hella. And behind you the fire around Samot has finally gone out. And the three cultists who set it, they try to charge in and finish him off, but they’re gone instantly. His glowing eyes pass from one to the next. They have no defense for him. But then he does turn his eyes to the Solarch, and the Solarch’s armor only glows a little bit. Whatever it is made of or powered by is seemingly made of sturdier stuff than the cultists. Um, across the room, Red Jack slams the butt of his sword on the top of the cultist’s head, and the cultist just drops. And as he hits the ground, there is a huge echoing crash, and Severea has begun to call down lightning. 
First to destroy the tarp. Just like, shatter it and- er kind of disintegrates it, I guess, and turns into scraps that are flying around in the air in the wind. And then again to try to strike the dragon. But it is- [exhales] it is- it is too late, even with the extra rain, even with the lightning. The dragon roars and sound is stripped from everyone for a moment. And you look up, and you can see that the red light from the sun has burnt a hole through the cloud cover. And the room, the whole room is cast in, under that red, and it’s- it’s darker somehow for the crimson light. And I think this is the moment, everything kind of frozen in place, everything silent. This is the moment. Hella, what do you do?
Ali: [exhales] God. None of these gods want to help me. I guess they’re busy. 
Austin: They’re gonna. They’re busy. [Ali laughs] They’re busy with-
Jack: Disintegrating people. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: -disintegrating people. 
Janine: Whatever you want to do, I will aid you. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: There you go. Friendship. Gal pals. 
Ali: Um, I have five HP. I know how to fight, and that’s about all I know how to do. [laughs] 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: And that’s about all I’m doing. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Um, I can look through these moves as much as I want. 
Austin: You can. What do you got? You got Through Death’s Eyes, which is-
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: -someone will die, right?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: You got- But it could also go bad. [light laugh] 
Ali: Yeah, it could also go bad. Yeah. 
Austin: You got armor. That’s not gonna help you here. You got uh… Dark Blade. 
Ali: I tried- Yeah, I tried to do that. 
Austin: Um, you got-
Ali: Are you sure- None of these people have been forceful this whole time? [laughs] 
Austin: Um-
Ali: It doesn’t matter. 
Austin: Yes, and the thing that was forceful was the dragon, but it didn’t knock you back. 
Ali: Uh hm. 
Austin: Which we should- we should pause and say is dope. Like, a big dragon hit you, and you like, took a lot of damage from it. But you stood in place, right? [Ali laughs] Uh, which did not happen last time. 
Ali: No. No. 
Austin: So-
Janine: It wasn’t even slimey that time. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Yeah, I’m better at dragon standing. Great. Uh- [laughs] Yeah, let me just roll Hack and Slash, I guess.
Austin: Alright. Yeah?
Ali: That’s not it?
Austin: Uh, no. Uh, there’s no secret code. I’m not waiting on a thing. Wait. Uh- uh, let’s get Adaire’s help first. 
Ali: Ok.
Austin: Adaire, how do you Aid and Interfere, and also what is your bond with Hella again?
Janine: Uh, my bond with Hella is ‘Hella’s loyalty is a tremendous and unreliable asset. Cultivate it actively.’ 
Austin: Tell me how you cultivate it. 
Janine: I.e. by cheering her on and supporting her in battle. 
Austin: Mm. 
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: Although she is deafened right now, so I can’t-
Austin: That’s not gonna do it. [amusingly] No.
Janine: Just do like, a pep talk. Hella, would you say fear is a motivator for you?
Austin: Oh my god. 
Janine: I’m just-
Ali: No. 
Janine: -I’m put- I’m just asking. [Ali and Janine laugh] 
Ali: Um-
Janine: In the time that Adaire has known Hella, would she say that Hella being afraid like, really pumps her up in a positive way?
Ali: Um. 
Austin: Like, the fight or flight response, basically. 
Janine: Yeah. Yeah. 
Ali: Yeah, that’s a complicated question. I- I- Because I don’t know that Adaire would think that Hella being afraid is in her best interest. But I would also think that um, Adaire has seen Hella kill a lot of people while very scared. So, yes. That’s- [laughs] 
Janine: That’s true. Ok-
Austin: Is there also an angle here where it’s like, about- Could you hit them both with it? Like, doesn’t it do an AoE if it’s- if it’s like, in between?
Janine: Ok, so the AoE on the dagger is that they won’t beg or flee, they’ll only panic or fight. 
Austin: Ok, well, you know, panic could be good. 
Janine: Which is what’s happening. So, um-
Austin: Yeah. I like the- I do kind of like the idea of like, alright they’ve both been deafened, if you can make them both afraid- You’re kind of like lowering- you’re kind of making it an even playing field in some ways. Do you know what I mean?
Janine: Yeah.
Austin: It’s like- it’s like the equivalent of like, when the WWE is like, ‘alright, we’re gonna have a street fight.’ [Ali laughs] Like, ‘sure, you might be a better technical wrestler, but if we’re in a fight, I’m gonna kick your ass. I’m Hella Varal.’ 
Janine: Yeah. 
Ali: Yeah, ok. Sure. Yeah. 
Janine: And having senses taken away like, might make you hesitate and stuff, so-
Austin: Right. 
Janine: -being like, ‘no, go for it like, seriously now.’ [laughs lightly]
Austin: Fight. 
Ali: Right. Yeah. 
Austin: Give me a-
Janine: ‘Do your thing.’ 
Austin: Give me an- an Aid-Interfere, Adaire. 
Janine: Um, would this be like, Dex for aim? For instance. 
Austin: No, it’s your bond. It’s 2d6 plus one-
Janine: Oh, right. Right, right, right.
Austin: -for- for- I mean, you can do- you could do the thing you’re talking about, but if you want to give Hella a plus one forward, which I think is the real thing you want to be doing-
Janine: Yeah. Yeah. 
Austin: -I’m happy to kind of blur it around the throwing the dagger cause I think it’s cool. [overlapped] Fan of- fan of the players.
Janine: Yeah. I just- I didn’t see bond on the thing, but-
Austin: No worries. Yeah. Oh yeah, there it is.
Janine: Bond, Hella. 
Austin: No. 
Janine: That’s a four. 
Austin: That’s a four. [Ali gasps]
Janine: Do it. 
Jack: [laughing] Oh no. 
Austin: You open yourself up to danger, retribution or cost. Uh, actually I get to make a move as hard as I want here. 
Janine: Great. 
Austin: Um, is really what I get to do. 
Janine: I had a good run. 
Jack: Austin, have you ever thought about making a move as soft as you want?
Austin: Wh- I thought hard includes soft. [Ali laughs quietly] 
Janine: [laughs lightly] That’s-
Jack: [laughs] Ok. 
Austin: As hard as I want includes all of the soft moves, too. Um- [Janine sighs] you throw the dagger, and [exhales] Hella, you get very scared. [Ali laughs] And the Solarch does not. Like, I think the Solarch steps forward in that way that like, you step ba- Uh, fuck. Ok. Mm. 
Janine: I hate when you do that- [Ali laughs] thing. When you- [Austin groans] swerve.
Ali: [quietly] It’s ok. 
Jack: Hmmm.
Ali: What is it that’s ok this time? [Ali and Jack laugh softly]
Austin: [exhales] I- Ok. [Ali laughs again] So… I think a few things happen at once. [Janine sighs] One, Hella, I think you need to make a Hack and Slash because the- as described, the thing either makes you panic or fight. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: You’re Hella Varal. I think it probably- Eh- Do you panic or do you fight? This is your choice. 
Ali: Oh, I fight. 
Austin: Ok. You give me a Hack and Slash with the note that you’re going to take damage regardless because of the fail. Or I guess, you know… Nope. Yeah. I- Yeah. Give me- give me the roll. [exhales] Uh, well. There- it’s a seven- [Ali laughs] which is a hard thing for you to roll anyway, so that’s appropriate. Go ahead and give me your damage. [Ali sighs] 
Jack: Whack him, Hella. 
Austin: Your damage is what? D10 plus one?
Ali: Yeah. So, seven.
Austin: So, seven. Hell yeah. And that’s- Does that pierce? It pierces one, right? Boy your hit points are low, huh?
Ali: I know. They’re very- Yeah. 
Austin: Alright. So, here’s the thing- This is- It’s like I said, a few things are gonna happen at once. 
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: I wish you could just do best of blah-blah-blah. 
Janine: If we survive this, I’m really gonna- gonna take Red Jack to task on his choice of targets in that last round there. [Ali and Austin laugh] There’s a giant knight there, but I guess I should smack this little guy instead. [Austin laughs] 
Austin: So, it’s the best of those two. So, it’s twelve to you from the Solarch. Do you have enough peace to do Divine Intervention again?
Ali: Sure don’t. 
Austin: Alright, so that’s twelve damage. Which is gonna drop you to zero again. 
Ali: Uh hm. 
Austin: Right? 
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: Even with whatever your armor is? What’s your armor again?
Ali: My armor has been three this whole time. 
Austin: Alright, and this- this ignores armor because it’s the Solarch. Uh, right. Um, duh. So, [exhales] I’m gonna need you to make this roll. 
Ali: Uh hm.
Austin: We put it off last time. We made a deal.
Ali: [laughs lightly] It’s time. 
Austin: This move is called Last Breath.
Ali: It is the one. 
Austin: It’s ‘when you are dying, you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the black gates of Death’s kingdom. Then roll. Just roll.’ You don’t have anything that gives you a bonus roll to this, right? [overlapped] I think-
Ali: No. Before you gave me a plus one cause Death did super care about me, but- [laughs]
Austin: Yeah. But in this- in this scenario, against someone who is wielding the Heat and the Dark directly?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: You know. [exhales] So, give me a 2d6. 
Ali: Sure. [exhales] Jeez.
Austin: That’s a six. Your fate is sealed. You’re marked as Death’s own. And you’ll cross the threshold soon. [someone exhales] The GM will tell you when. The Solarch pierces your chest, Hella Varal, with a blade made of the Heat and the Dark. The same blade that you tore from Hadrian, that you snapped and sent away. And everything freezes. And Samot says, 
Austin (as Samot): It is time. 
Austin: And Hella, it is like a dream. First, the Collector-Curator Kall Fer re-enters the room slowly, backwards. The bodies of some of the cultists on the ground return to life. And things begin to move forward again. Red Jack chooses a different target. And this time closes in and pushes the Solarch in a different direction, but in the end you are still slain. And so, Samot rolls it back again. And this time, he imagines a world where Adaire defeats a different set of cultists which changes the flow of the fight altogether, but it still ends with that blade between the plates or your armor. And then again, it rewinds and this time, you all try to turn the dragon against the Solarch, but no, that is a failed plan, too. You see events play out over and over and over again. 
But each time Samot can only go as far back as the moment that he arrived through Sunder Havelton’s pattern magic. And so, over and over, you go through this fight as Samot tries to work out a winning strategy. Some way for the Solarch’s threat to be erased. And bit by bit, through this trial and error process, he starts to make progress. He puppets you differently. He finds openings against the Solarch that you did not. Or he finds a weakness, a blind spot, something, any advantage. And you find yourself pressuring him further, getting in extra hits, piercing his armor. But he continues to pierce yours, too. Sometimes in long, wide swipes. Other times with little lucky scratches. And those wounds seem to heal whenever Samot turns back the clock, but this is the Heat and the Dark. And as Samot, even with his godly body, knows well, it leaves wounds that you cannot simply stitch shut. Some things cannot be so easily fixed. Some things are deeper than flesh. 
And after what feels like an eternity to you, though I guess passes in a blink for everyone else- I don’t think anyone else sees any of that. It’s only you, Hella, who is aware. You find yourself standing in front of the Solarch with your blade piercing his chest as he kneels before you. You are still marked, Hella. Your time is limited. The Heat and the Dark is in you. There are things that cannot be so easily reconfigured. Not yet. But Samot has seen his moment and is taking it. There was a reason the Erasure was called that. It was a term that was tied to authorship. It was tied to the loss of text. That is because the thing that made the gods the gods was their ability to reconfigure the past, to edit history. Which was lost when Samothes, the second, was pinned to the ground deep below the surface of Hieron in a device of his own creation that siphoned away that ability away from the rest of the gods. Samothes is dead. The device lays dormant. Samot knows this. 
And as you all see this begin to happen, it leaves your mind. I think everyone except for Hella who because her fate has shifted just so, or at least for now, remembers that there was another way this went. Instead though, you now have your blade in the chest of the Solarch, whose gauntlet falls off. And the ring begins to slip. But I think it’s too late for that. No matter how many times he re-runs it, he can’t find a solution that ends this ritual before the dragon is complete. And so it roars. 
[1:00:00]
It lifts away. It will not be what it was if it had come with the Solarch. But it is free and in the wild. But the Solarch is dead at its feet, as is Kall Fer and Zhan Kurr and the pala-din, Frigate. We will discuss when you will die, Hella. It will not be today, but this thing is eating at you and is unavoidable. Are there any questions about what just happened in plain terms? Because I want to be as clear as I can about this. I know that’s like, a big question. 
Jack: So, we saw some kind of- some kind of reconfiguration, right?
Austin: You didn’t cause you weren’t there, but- [Jack laughs] We, the listeners, did. 
Jack: Like in a very literal sense. 
Janine: And the people who were there didn’t- don’t reg- don’t retain the memories-
Austin: Right. 
Janine: -of the refig- reconfiguration.
Austin: You lived through it. Your bodies lived through it, right? Like, it happens, but you don’t remember it. You don’t recollect it, except for Hella who is still marked and because of that weird connection because she’s central to it has retained that information. But it- How do you explain what just happened? Do you know- Uh, you know. Especially cause you know this has happened once before with Hadrian. You know that Samot has intervened before in this way. 
Jack: So as far as-
Austin: [overlapping] But in a much smaller, more local way. That was just about who stabbed who, you know? This ends up being about like, he’s trying to stop this fucking dragon from leaving, and he can’t do that. But he does manage to get the Solarch dead. 
Jack: So, in terms of what-
Austin: Go ahead. 
Jack: -Adaire- As far as Adaire’s concerned-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -it was always that Hella stabbed the Solarch?
Austin: Always. Red Jack charges in, pushes him over. The two of them do a team up attack, you know?
Jack: It’s like, classic, old-school reconfiguration. 
Austin: It’s classic, old-school reconfiguration. Local reconfiguration. You don’t, you know, you are not at- at lamina one now. You’re still-
Jack: No. 
Austin: You’re still zeroes. 
Jack: But it’s like, ‘Oh, the bank was always there. What are you talking about?’
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [Jack exhales] He learned this fairly recently, that he could do this again. He learned this when he learned that his son was dead again and has been sitting on that knowledge. And has now pulled the trigger. Which is to say, we- we’ve seen him do a version of this with Hadrian obviously in season one. But again, that was like, such a simpler thing. And it was at a kind of a place of power and possibility. His own fallen tower where there were other alternate universes to play with. If you don’t remember that, go back and maybe check that out. Whereas here, this is just- this is what they used to do. I mean they did bigger things, too, right? They would build entire new histories and let them play out like this. 
This is what lamina were, but much, much, much larger, and to do anything bigger than something like this, he would need to build a whole new world. Not just you know, change the events of the last five minutes. Also, it’s um- it’s not clear if Severea knows this. But Hella, one thing I will give you is that you know- you know because you lived through it that he never changes Severea’s actions during play. He kind of like- er during his- during the reconfiguration. He works around what she does. Maybe if he tried to reconfigure her, things would have gone differently. Um, but I guess you know- I think it is fair to say that you know he doesn’t change what she does. 
You notice that, and it’s probably fair to extrapolate that maybe she would know if he had tried that. But because he didn’t touch her, she doesn’t know. Because she wasn’t directly impacted by this stuff. The dragon roars that literal deafening roar, the roar that removes sound, as it lifts away to fly into the countryside. But it is not directed, right? It is in some ways an embodiment of the Heat and the Dark. You know, again, this game is not gonna have a final boss, you know? Um, killing this dragon does not solve the big problem with the Heat and the Dark. But as long as it does live out in the world as this thing that is probably greater than even what this one room could do without many of you dying trying to fight, [exhales] you will- it will hurt people. You know? Um, so it’s a- it’s a piece on the table. One of the big remaining pieces. Hella, how do you feel?
Ali: Um- [exhales] bad I bet. [pauses] I don’t know. I think that there’s… There’s like a moment of glory that would usually be associated with- [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: -these sorts of situations. But I think that she’s still like, even if there isn’t like, a magical effect on her brain right now or whatever, it’s still like, deaf to her, right?
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: It would be- She doesn’t feel present in the situation that- the way that she would like, ever, you know?
Austin: Yeah. Red Jack doesn’t know that. What Red Jack says is, 
Austin (as Red Jack): Hela Varal. Queen Killer and now Slayer of the Solarch. Add another title. 
Austin: I do think we see Severea and Samot like, their eyes meet. She, at the very least, seems to know something is off. But it’s hard to read. What’s like, leaving this place look like? Um, I think like-
Janine: I think we do a sweep, right?
Austin: Yeah. Yeah, you sweep the place. Uklan Tel is stable, but very, very weak. It’s not clear if he’ll live. Isaac Addleton made a run for it, I think. God, what’s he do?
Janine: He didn’t know the thing, did he?
Austin: He didn’t know the thing. [Ali laughs] 
Janine: He didn’t know the arm thing. 
Austin: He didn’t know the arm thing. No one told him the arm thing. Cause the- who-
Janine: What a shame. 
Ali: Shame.
Austin: I think he just get- [light laugh] Does he just get zapped? He just gets zapped. 
Ali: That’s so funny. 
Austin: The only- [Austin and Jack laugh] Yeah. Like, eventually you all- [Janine laughs lightly]
Jack: The perfect end. 
Austin: [laughs] It really is. You know, at some point, you- y’all pop out, and Callowkeen’s like, 
Austin (as Callowkeen): Only one person came out. [Austin, then Jack, then Janine laugh]
Austin: Pile of ash. [Jack continues laughing] Isaac Ashleton. Um, Tel is hurt, but is not- like, I said is- is not conscious. He’ll need to be carried back. We didn’t- You know, I- I suspect there were other- there- you know, we didn’t talk too much about Severea’s guards, and I think that’s because they got caught up in that dorm room that’s on the map and some of the other rooms like, fighting a couple of other guards throughout the place. But like, you know, you clean it out. It’s- It was basically the regional like, headquarters of this cult that you know, has spread across the entire continent, but at this point, you’ve cut off its head. You’ve cut off the source of its direct power. And the Advocate is not- the Advocate is not thinking in the way that the Solarch was. Is not thinking in the way that Samothes was. There’s no one pulling the strings anymore. Like, I don’t even know if Lardwulf’s group will meet this week. You know? Maybe it will. It actually maybe will be fine. Like, maybe it’ll just be a group of people-
Janine: That’s- that-
Austin: -helping each other.
Janine: Yeah, that’s why I’m like, is there like, a notebook or something around here?
Austin: Yeah, yeah. Totally. Like, what do you want to find? Like, honestly, it’s- You’ve- you can go through all of it. There’s no mystery at this point for- on my side. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: I’m not holding anything back. 
Janine: I think this is the thing where like- man, I’m almost glad that we aren’t aware of the reconfiguration cause I think Adaire, if she ever finds out what quote-unquote actually happened-
Austin: Uh uh. 
Janine: -will take that very badly. 
Austin: Oh yeah. Totally. 
Janine: Uh, but in the moment, she’s like, ‘ok, well we didn’t get the dragon, but-’
Austin: Right. ‘But we’ve stopped the Solarch.’ 
Janine: -um, ‘we’re all pretty much ok.’ And uh, I’m just gonna do a pass on this place and see if there’s anything that stands out as like-
Austin: Yeah. You know what?
Janine: -as relevant. 
Austin: Everyone heal up to max, except for Lem who wasn’t there. No one got hurt in that fight. It’s like, you remember in Assassin’s Creed 1 how you didn’t have HP, you had synchronization? [Ali laughs] 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: It’s like, oh, no- like, Altaïr never got hurt. Altaïr is history. Like, a hundred percent synchronization means-
Jack: God. 
Austin: -I never got hit. Uh, that’s what happened here, right? It’s like, Samot ran this over and over again to be as efficient as possible. And there just wasn’t a- hm, couldn’t quite get the full win, but you know. God, and I bet there’s moments here, Hella, also where you continue to get hit by that blade, right? In the re- in the re-telling- or like, the- during the reconfiguration, and like, that’s part of why you are marked is in trying to rewrite it over and over again, there’s like, permanent damage being done. There are things I want before we wrap. One is, yeah, Adaire, if you have questions or if you have something you want to find here, tell me what that thing is. 
Janine: Um, I want to find a list of people involved. Like-
Austin: Totally. 
Janine: I want to- I want to find their bookkeeping room. 
Austin: You have it, right? The Prelate’s room has all of that stuff. Uh, you have the spells. You have a history of their relationship with- with Uklan Tel. You have like, all the stuff they’ve stolen over the years in this region in the storage room. You have like, a list of other storage places that they’ve been keeping stuff. 
They- they have, not here, but in a place between here and the University, a huge storehouse of food that they’ve been um, rationing for- you know, for years either by taking from other communities or stuff that they have, you know, kept in some sort of- either- either stuff that’s like, non- either stuff that’s like, non-perishable by way of enchantment or special technique or stuff that they have recently taken from other communities or have gotten via tithe or have bought with the money that they’ve gotten via tithe, right? So like, that’s a huge plus for the community is you can immediately come back with a bunch of extra food or like, find storehouses of food. 
And then yeah, you know the names of everyone in the community in- back at the Last University who is part of this thing. Anyone who- and you know, like, all the places where they would meet. You can round them up, if that’s a thing you want to do. But that’s a decision you’ll have to make together presumably?
Janine: Yeah, I think Adaire is probably thinking like, ‘I’m just gonna- I’m you know-’ She’s loading her arms up with like, binders. [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah. Uh huh.
Janine: And being like, ‘I’m gonna bring these back to Ephrim. We’re all gonna have a talk.’
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: Cause I don’t think a- a um, settlement wide mystery purge is necessarily going to help things-
Austin: No. 
Janine: -in terms of morale. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. 
Janine: But talking certainly. Food. Good things. 
Austin: Uh hm. Cool. Hella? Do you-
Janine: Gonna pick up her gloves also and put them-
Austin: Yeah, and put those- Yeah. Uh huh. [Ali laughs] 
Janine: -before going outside. [laughs]
Austin: Uh hm. You teach everybody the maneuver to make as they go. I guess Callowkeen, once he sees you, he’s like, ‘Alright, we’re cool now?’ And like, yeah. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, Hella. Do you- Before we wrap, I want to just check in on Lem. Make sure Lem is- Do you have anything else you want to do before we wrap, Lem?
Jack: No. I think- I think I’m- I think I’ve done more than enough. [Ali laughs] 
Austin: [laughs] Ok. Uh, and Hella, do you talk to Adelaide about this when you get back? Do you talk to anybody about this? Talk to Adaire- like, what do you do?
Ali: Um, I don’t know. It’s tough. It’s- it’s weird not knowing who she would reach out to. Especially when everyone’s like, ‘Hey, you did a good job. That was-’
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: ‘You were fine the whole time. You looked great.’ [laughs] 
Austin: Uh hm. Right? Even Adelaide, right?
Ali: Uh, yeah. I mean, she’s not- She’s not clued in on the-?
Austin: It doesn’t- Nah. Like, not- not in that way. 
Ali: It doesn’t work like that.
Austin: Yeah. The big global stuff from her perspective would be very clear, [light laugh] right? 
Ali: Right.
Austin: If there was like, a new lamina added- if- if Samot undid- you know? But just in that room? I don’t know. Um, [exhales] what do you think? What do you think is more interesting? Do you think it’s more interesting that she and you know together [Ali laughs lightly] and no one else does and she knows because of the special bond? Or do you think it’s more interesting to have this be a thing that Hella knows alone? And has to tell people about or has to- you know, has to carry. Cause I’m interested in what you’re interested in here. 
Ali: Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, yeah. I don’t know. I guess the question is I don’t know if this is like, an opportunity to maybe talk to Severea about it instead. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: But I feel like Adelaide would know. Cause she would be the one to like, sort of fill in the blanks of like, ‘I can’t help you.’ Right?
Austin: Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. And then you could still have that conversation with Severea during downtime or something, right?
Ali: Right. Yeah, yeah. But I think the- like, yeah. I think she would reach out to Adelaide in that moment and be like, 
Ali (as Hella): There’s-  something went wrong, and I don’t… know what it is. 
Ali: Um, because I think that there’s like, you know, sometimes you just feel sick, and you don’t know-
Austin: Yeah. Um, do you visit her there? Like, is this happening between- where is this happening? Just in your head? Is this happening in person?
Ali: Yeah, I guess so. I- I- We- I accessed Adularia with Lem, but it was like a um- it was like as if I went into like, a phone booth.
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Ali: Like I was still present in real life, but-
Austin: I think it happens when you’re like- Maybe everybody’s picking through that place still, right? 
Ali: Uh hm. 
Austin: And you go into the storage room, and there’s the big broken mirror from where Sunder did the pattern magic to teleport everybody there. And you look into one of the mirror shards, and it’s Adularia. And then when you look- like, you look down and you look back up, and then you’re there, right?
Ali: Uh hm. 
Austin: Um, and at her feet- like, Adelaide is there, and at her feet are the opals and pearls that like, she tried to block all of those blows with, but that didn’t work. [Ali laughs softly] 
[1:15:00]
Austin (cont.): They didn’t pass through. And she’s been crying, but it’s like, dried a little bit now. And she’s like-
Ali: But that’s the thing is does- did Samot like, write her out? Like, how does that even-
Austin: Yeah- Uh no. I think she- I think that like- [Ali sighs] No, no, no, no. Like, so the first time it works. But then it stops working. 
Ali: Right. 
Austin: And he keeps getting hits in on you. Do you know what I mean? Like-
Ali: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Austin: Samot couldn’t find- Sometimes a game is- You know, sometimes you get the cut scene. [light laugh] [Ali laughs] Sometimes you- sometimes you take the hits, you know?
Ali: Right.
Austin: Um, and I think in the process of trying to get to that win, all of those hits add up. And that’s part of why you’re marked. You know what I mean?
Ali: Mm. Uh hm. 
Austin: And she couldn’t consistently block them with that technique. And she sees it. She- she, I think through you, sees the whole process. And is like, 
Austin (as Adelaide): [softly] Hella. Oh, Hella. 
Austin: And like, moves toward you. Her hands moving up to your face. 
Ali (as Hella): [quietly] Why are you upset? There’s- there’s nothing to be upset about. 
Austin (as Adelaide): I won’t- [pauses] He hurt you bad, Hella. [exhales] I can’t hold it at bay forever. 
Ali (as Hella): That’s ok. [exhales] We knew this wasn’t gonna be… There were risks. It’s fine. 
Austin (as Adelaide): I’m- I’m gonna figure something out. There are… Tristero… Maybe we could- Mm. I should talk to Samot. 
Ali (as Hella): I… I’d be happy to get you in touch. [Ali laughs softly] 
Austin (as Adelaide): I love you. 
Ali: [laughs] Oh my god. I almost said ‘I know.’ I like, felt it. [everyone laughs] [laughing while talking] I was just like, don’t do that. 
Janine: Do the name mix up thing again. That was good. [light laugh]
Austin: [still laughing] Uh huh. [Ali continues laughing] Ugh. 
Ali: Ugh. I would love to be Han Solo. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: Ok. [laughs again] Um, the thing that she actually does is I think that she raises her hand, and she says, 
Ali (as Hella): I love you, too. And- and that’s why it’s fine. I know this is gonna be fine either way. 
Austin (as Adelaide): [breathes out deeply] I don’t know when yet. There’s a long line. A lot of folks dyin’. But… I thought I wouldn’t have to let go of you. I thought I would get to play with you forever. 
Ali (as Hella): Things aren’t always fair. [light laugh] We know that. 
Austin (as Adelaide): We do. We need to make the most of our time. You should come visit… The community is growing. Word is spreading. And there are some beautiful places here. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. Um, I don’t know how I’m gonna approach this in Hieron. 
Ali: I guess is what she’d say. God. [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali (as Hella): But um, it would be stupid not to make the time. So-
Austin (as Adelaide): Stay here tonight. I know people want to celebrate in the university, but…
Ali (as Hella): [exhales] I’ve done enough for that university. I can- I can stay here. 
Austin: I think she pulls you in a little closer. [Ali laughs softly] Slides an arm around your back, and then like, kisses you and then slides back to like, be beside you and like, walk down the shore towards the city itself. There is something about like, the black sands here and thinking about the black sands that the Advocate caused. Like, I don’t think Hella sees this, but like, for the viewer, there is still something about like- this sand is similar enough to strike a mirrored chord, you know? For what the Advocate did south of Kanton. And- and you know, in the southwest of Hieron. That it’s hard to- to distinguish. 
And then yeah…. In the university, people are calmer. The second sun has vanished. It pops at a certain point in a bright, red explosion across the sky, but then the thunderstorm hits, and I think the rain begins to cool everything down. People feel a little closer than they were before. There’s a great story going around about this team of heroes having stopped an evil cult that was trying to infiltrate them. Members of that cult in this place don’t really even understand it to some degree, you know? I think Adaire, Lardwulf like, says like, 
Austin (as Lardwulf): I hear you’re a hero!
Austin: As you walk by at some point. 
Janine: ‘Who are you again?’ No, she doesn’t say that. 
Austin: Yeah. [laughs] Exactly. Um, and Lem, you find you- you wake up to news that all of your friends have lived and that everyone is safe and sound. 
Jack (as Lem): [breathes deeply] A bad dream. 
Austin (as Emmanuel): A bad dream. A real one. 
Jack (as Lem): Like strange.
Austin (as Emmanuel): Yeah. 
Jack (as Lem): Well, I’m glad Hella’s ok. 
Austin: Oh boy. [light laugh] Oh boy. In fact, Hella, you have arrived- 
[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” begins playing in the background] 
Austin (cont.): -to Adularia’s throne room where Adelaide sits in the throne. You next to her. And you’ve gone on your tour, and you’ve chatted. And now you are winding down. Until you hear the sound of a door opening and someone new arriving. 
[Music plays out to end]
