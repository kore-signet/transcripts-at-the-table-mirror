SPRING IN HIERON 19: A NIGHT LIKE TONIGHT
Transcriber: Cole
Austin: Hella Varal, tonight you have taken the late shift, and you are therefore walking around the perimeter of the Last University on a patrol route. And so far, it has been uneventful, and thankfully you’re coming up to one of the more relaxed segments of the trip towards the cemetery temple and the cemetery grounds themselves. Um, as you can see on the map, there have been a lot of refugees who have moved into the neighborhood. But mostly they stay away from the cemetery, the kind of small hill that marks the cemetery proper and also from the cemetery- er, from the temple to its east out of respect and probably out of superstition, as well. There is a plant near the cemetery that only flowers near here, and it has a very strong smell. What is it? What’s the smell that it has? I think it’s a pleasant smell. 
Ali: Oh, um, hmm. Maybe like a um, like a [exhales] I don’t know, how do you describe smells? [Ali and Austin laugh lightly] Like a citrusy one- like kind of a fresh sort of-
Austin: Ooo
Ali: You know, just like a nice-
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: -scent. [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah, like a nice, citrusy smell. That makes sense. I’m here for it. Um, that smell retracts from the hill. And you briefly think you maybe hear someone say something under their breath or a conversation in the distance. It’s hard to tell. What do you do?
Ali: Um, can I like, approach slowly and try to focus on the voices?
Austin: Yeah. Yeah, give me a- I think- I think to find out where it is, you’ll have to Discern Realities, so closely study a situation. Roll + wisdom. 
Ali: Sure. Oh boy. Ok. [laughs] 
Austin: What’s your- what’s your wisdom?
Ali: It is zero. 
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: But that’s not a negative 1, so we’re good. 7.
Austin: Alright, that’s a 7. You get to ask me one question. What happened here recently? What is about to happen? What should I be on the lookout for? What here is useful or valuable to me? Who is really in control here? Or what here is not what it appears to be?
Ali: What should I be on the lookout for?
Austin: Um, so the funny thing is, the sound is basically gone at this point. There’s no more talking or humming, but what you are able to do is follow that absence of scent. You’re able to like, like, ‘Ok, well, over here it still smells like kind of citrusy and orangey, but right here, it doesn't.’ And you take a step, you can still smell that way, and you find yourself being led to a tree. And you see a person- a humanoid figure with a lar- with like, a long cloak with their arms outstretched in- in a kind of like, open-armed shape. 
[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” begins playing in the background] 
Um, and there is a- there is the- the smell of something burning suddenly, and that smell disappears, too. And then you start to feel the ground shake. And so this is- this is what you should be on the lookout for. Some- someone is doing some sort of magical ritual at your cemetery. 
[Music plays out to end]

Austin: We are continuing our game of Dungeon World by Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel. We are, as always, my principles are to portray a fantastic world, to fill the characters’ lives with adventure, and to play to find out what happens. Real quick, before we cut back to whatever Hella’s gonna do. It’s kind of the middle of the night, at like 2 or 3 am. Lem, where are you at this moment?
Jack: Um, I think I am-
Austin: It’s not a special night. It’s just like a Tuesday, you know?
Jack: I think I’m asleep in the Lending Library? 
Austin: Hmm. Great. 
Jack: Um, I think I went out to get something, and I- [laughs] I woke up to- to- you know, I woke up in the middle of the night, and I was like, you know, I want to go check on a thing. 
Austin: Sure. 
Jack: I can’t sleep. And I went down to the Lending Library, and I got a book. And I sat down at my desk in the Lending Library, and then I was just like, and now it’s time to sleep apparently.
Austin: [laughs] Great. 
Jack: Um, so he’s just keeled over. 
Austin: Adaire, how about you?
Janine: Um, hmm. I don’t know. I think Adaire’s probably just like, normal sleeping.
Austin: [laughs] Ok. Where do you stay?
Jack: [laughs] Like a regular person. 
Janine: Is- weren’t we shown to like, just like a- like a bunk house?
Austin: There’s like, a dormitory house. 
Janine: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Southend. Ok. 
Janine: That is probably where Adaire sleeps. 
Austin: Hope you’re havin’ just a great night of sleep is my hope for you. Um, Hella. [Ali laughs] What’s good? What’s going on on the cemetery hill?
Ali: So, this- this is definitely- the ground is shaking. I don’t recognize this person. 
Austin: This person’s not-
Ali: There’s no way- 
Austin: This person-
Ali: Yeah, there’s no way I would assume like, ‘Oh, they’re just- you know?’
Austin: No, this is- this is- You are an Ordennan. You know what the fuck is going on. Like, I think there’s probably even a brief flash where like, ‘Ah, fuck. Right. Like the fuckin’- the justiciars are 99% wrong, but sometimes there is someone doing some dark magic bullshit’, right? [Ali laughs]  Um, this person’s facing away from you, so you do not see their face. 
Ali: Ok. Oh boy. Um, I think that I… I’m gonna look through my gear.
Austin: Yeah, you’re also all- you’re like wearing whatever the fuck you want, right? 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: You’re out on patrol. This is not one of those situations where I’m like, ‘Haha. You don’t have your good armor.’
Ali: Yeah, I’m not in pajamas at work. Like no. Um, yeah. I think I just go for it. I mean-
Austin: What’s that mean?
Ali: [laughs] How far is this person from me?
Austin: 30 feet.
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Like, I think you come up over the hill. Like past- past some trees and mausoleums and stuff, and then you see what they’re doing. They’re underneath a big tree.
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: That’s what they’re doing. 
Ali: I think that I’m- I’m gonna close the distance like halfway, and then call out to them in like a, ‘Hey.’ Like a very specific like, ‘Hey, stop what you’re doing’ sort of way. 
Austin: Uh huh. Uh huh. You don’t have a move for this, right? You don’t have like an I am the Law equivalent, right?
Ali: Not yet. 
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: We have to make eye contact. [laughs] 
Austin: Oh, right. True. True. Well, god. Um, give me a Defy Danger charisma.
Ali: Sure. 
Austin: That is a 10. So, I think this person- the danger that you stopped is- uh, this person turns to face you. Um, and at this distance, I don’t think you know this person well enough to ID them quickly, but there are- there are facial features here that if it was- if it was the middle of the day, you would be able to ID. This is not like a person you know tight- you’re not tight with this person. Do you know what I mean? This is not secretly like, you’re gonna kill this person, and you’re like, ‘Oh no! It’s my best frieeeeeeennnndd.’ [Ali laughs] ‘Hadrian was out here actuallyyyy.’ This person, she says, 
Austin (as unidentified person): It is too late. The ritual’s already done. You should flee with your life.
Ali: Um-
Austin: The ground does continue to shake.
Ali: Ok. [more firmly] Ok. So, someone just told me that I should flee with my life.
Austin: Yes. 
Ali: Um, so I’m gonna grab my sword, [Austin and Jack laugh] and I’m gonna say, 
Ali (as Hella): Only one person here is leaving with their life. 
Ali: And attack them, I guess?
Austin: Oh, I thought you were doing that move that does that- Oh, do you not have that anymore? Yeah, you do. 
Ali: Oh I- Yeah, I do. 
Austin: You’re not doing that though?
Ali: [exhales] I guess I’m still kind of far away. I might as well because it will get me a bonus when I get there. 
Austin: Yeah, so this is Through Death’s Eyes is the one I was thinking of. 
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: Where you get to name someone and decide who lives and who dies. 
Ali: Oooh, sure. 
Austin: That’s the one that I thought you were doing. 
Ali: Oh, I thought I was doing- I thought you meant Dead Eyes which is like, someone will flinch if I look at them, which is also great. 
Austin: It’s true. 
Ali: Um, no, yeah. Sure. Through Death’s Eyes. 
Austin: I mean- you should pick. You should pick one of those two. Cause it’s one or the other, prob- probably. Right?
Ali: Yeah. I feel like I know about their true nature. 
Austin: [laughs] Yeah. Fair. 
Ali: I feel like I’ve gotten a sense of it, so I’m going to- When I enter a battle-
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: -name someone who will live and someone who will die. Name NPCs, not player characters. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Um, cool. Let me- let me roll this, and let’s see what happens. 
Austin: Yeah, roll- Roll + WIS. Which again is plus- Alright.
Jack: Oh. 
Austin: It’s a 6. Ok. [Ali makes uncomfortable noise] Um, hmm. Ok. Miss, you see your own death and consequently take minus one ongoing through the battle. 
Ali: Hmm. 
Austin: Um, what- what do you see when you see your own death here? Is it your own death here? At this moment? Like, or is it- do you read this- How do you read this move?
Ali: Yeah, I think it’s like- it’s- it’s the- It’s my own death if I don’t succeed here, right?
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: Which is not- maybe it’s not like this person strikes me down, but it is this university is unsafe now. 
Austin: Right. 
Ali: Um, you know? Whatever-
Austin: I mean, it’s your own death, so yeah, yeah. I guess that’s my question is like, what is the death that you see here?
Ali: I mean, I was trying to think of the worst spell that Hella could think of, but maybe that’s not- [aughs] 
Austin: Hmm. Um, I can give you a little- maybe, maybe the- maybe it’s like, this is a thing that breaks your- Maybe you lock eyes with her, and then you see that she is still saying something under her breath. And in a- in like, before you can finish locking eyes with her and like, finish Death’s Eyes, um, you see a skeleton hand begin to pop up from a grave nearby. And there are 6 of these hands punching up through the ground. So, 3- 3 skeleton people are punching up. So, maybe that is the vision is like, one of those hands grabbing your legs, and then you’re like, ‘Oh, shit. I cannot- Ok, wait. This maybe isn’t going how the way I thought.’ Um-
Ali: [laughing] Yeah, it’s that vision plus that happening for everyone here. 
Austin: Right. Right. Ok. Yeah, totally. 
Ali: Cause that’s the important part. Um-
Austin: Um, and I think ad- I want to be clear, I think like, in this moment, you’re still gonna keep this minus one forward, but you absolutely hear Adelaide say,
Austin (as Adelaide): That’s not how it’s gonna happen. [Ali laughs] 
Austin: Um, so I’m not gonna stop you from trying to charge in and hack and slash here, um, with the note that there are now this one person who is clearly doing some sort of weird summoning ritual, and then secondly- er did some sort of weird summoning ritual, but is now summoning skeletons. And then also, uh, the skeletons are- there are 3 skeletons climbing out of the grave, plus this- this person who is this cultist.
Ali: Ok. I’m going to say, as a professional magic smiter- [laughs]
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: -and high-level guard, I’m gonna go- I’m gonna continue going for the cultist and assume that like, maybe if I kill them, the skeletons will go away. And if they don’t, that’s something the guards can take care of. 
Austin: Tap my head three times. Yeah. 
Ali: [laughs] So-
Austin: You kill a cultist, you know? Yeah. 
Ali: Yeah, you know? Maybe the spell breaks. So, yeah, I think that it is just like, a charge. This person is a danger. 
Austin: Yep. 
Ali: That is clear. Um, and I would like to Hack and Slash them. So, I roll- [laughs lightly]
Austin: Go ahead, and give me that. That’s +3, so- and that is a 9 still, although, minus one is an 8. So, not close enough to even get a bonus plus one there somehow, right? Um, so when you hack and slash at a 7-9, you deal your damage to the enemy, and the enemy makes an attack against you. So, you do damage to each other. So, go ahead and give me your damage which is-
Ali: D10. 
Austin: It’s a D10 plus something, right? Because you have- does that sword give you- You get plus 1 piercing. 
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: Or is it just- is it 1 piercing or is it plus 1 piercing? I think it’s plus 1 piercing. It’s a- it’s plus 1 damage plus it has, 1 piercing, I think. [typing] 
Ali: I think that was the thing cause it’s sharp, right?
Austin: Yeah- that’s a thing. That means a specific thing in this game. Um, op, there we go. 
[0:15:00]
Ali: It’s sharp which is plus 1 piercing, and then ancient which is take one plus to- take plus one to spout lore, which is a thing I should remember. 
Austin: You- that’s- That sounds like a thing you should remember, for sure. Wait, are you sure it’s only- it’s only plus 1? Huh. 
Ali: We might have grabbed this from the Dark Blade. 
Austin: Oh, you know what? That’s the Dark Blade book. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ali: Yeah, and not um-
Austin: That makes sense. That makes sense. Oh fuck. I have to redownload that doc. You know what? I’m on a computer. [typing] 
Ali: I need that doc cause I need a move, too, yeah, anyway.
Austin: Love to have computer things. Um-
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: Ok. Then yeah. Go ahead and roll that damage. 
Ali: That’s a 6. 
Austin: That is a 6 with- with one piercing. Um, so it goes through her armor. You can sense- as you get closer- one, I think you just like, charge in past the skeleton hands, and you get the blade- like you just catch her in the side 100%. Like it just goes into like, the side of her like, ribs basically. Um, piercing through her armor. And- and hurting her very bad. And this close, under the moonlight, you can see that she is um- you met her. You met her once, actually. Um, in the Buoy. [Ali gasps] This is Exarch Braeven, who you had briefly had a dinner with in the uh, the Church of the Dark Son after a service there. Uh, you were in that group, right? Or did you go with the other group?
Ali: No, I was at dinner. 
Austin: Ok. I wasn’t sure. I couldn’t remember if everybody was at that dinner or not. But if yeah- if you were at that dinner, you’re like, ‘Oh shit. This is that Church of the Dark Son exarch’ who is now bleeding very badly. And she is gonna do damage back to you. 
Ali: Yeah, I accidentally started the hook-up talk. 
Austin: That’s right. That’s right. Hold up, let me roll. Uh, 3 damage, one piercing there, also. Um, and also, does that- does that get through your armor?
Ali: I- I have 3 armor. 
Austin: Alright, so- so yes. That will pierce one. One of those gets through. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: So, take 1 damage, and then also, you feel your muscles begin to seize up a little bit. Take minus 1 on all strength rolls as poison begins to move through your body. Um, these 3 skeletons have now stand- stood up behind you. [Ali laughs] She is like, coughing. I think she’s like, 
Austin (as Exarch Braeven): [labored] It’s already too late. 
Austin: And is trying to like, push herself away from you and get away at this point. Um, but the 3 skeletons are up behind you, and the ground is still shaking. Which means there must be something else coming. 
Ali: [sighs] Ok, this is a lot.
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: [laughs] Is there a way that I can like- if I’m close enough to like, grab onto her wrist. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: And like, do some sort of like, [laughs] aggressive stance and like demand that she reverse the spell or whatever?
Austin: I think that’s not- I don’t think this is that person. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: You know what I mean? 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Like, if this was a Moonlighter, that would be one thing. But this is- this is someone who is high up in the church who is willing to give their life for this, right?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, you could- if you have a move that specifically can do this, I would say, you can do it. But I’m not gonna let you like, Defy Danger on this. Do you know what I mean? Um, but you might have a move. I- I genuinely you could have a move. 
Ali: I feel like the leverage I have is I’m gonna kill you, but if it’s someone who is willing to die for this-
Austin: Willing to give their life, right? Yeah. 
Ali: Yeah. Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah, there is a b- like, this person has a belief, and that belief is, ‘I would die to blank.’ And this is the thing that they would die to do. That she would die to do. 
Ali: Well, good for them. Um- [Austin and Janine laugh] Ugg. I do want to kill this person.
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: Um, [laughs] um, I- I wonder if I can like, get someone’s attention though. 
Austin: Sure. 
Ali: So this is not a fight that I’m having by myself. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Um, but I should kill this person first, probably. [laughs] That was me prioritizing. 
Austin: I think this is an interesting- Yeah, I think this is an interesting moment for Hella. What is she prioritizing here? Is she prioritizing getting the word out or is she prioritizing getting the kill? [Ali sighs]  I could make that a very, in-fiction decision, too, right? Like she could taunt you about that if that’s more interesting. Do you know what I mean? Like, she can pull away from you a bit, have her blade out- her poison blade- it’s gonna- it’s like, you know, dripping with poison, and I think she says like… Um, I guess she wo- she would still call you Queen Killer. She wouldn’t call you Death’s servant yet, she doesn’t know that. [Ali laughs] So, she’s like, 
Austin (as Exarch Braeven): Queen Killer, make your choice. End me now or go prepare your people for what is to come. 
Austin: And also the skeletons are like, rattling towards you from behind. 
Ali: Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Um, [laughs] I think it’s- it’s tough because I do- I yeah, I think this close and this like, fresh a target, [laughs] it’s gonna happen. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: But I feel like I do- There should be- I do want her to like, inquire about what’s happening. Or be like- or make an attempt to be like, ‘Tell me what this was.’ or like, Stop that.’ Or like- [laughs] 
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: It’s an empty threat. She’s still holding her sword up. 
Austin: Right. 
This person can refuse to say anything and is still probably gonna get stabbed. 
Austin: So, this is not interrogating. You are not doing that?
Ali: I don’t know that this is a private chat with an NPC. 
Austin: This is a private chat with an NPC. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: What? It’s the middle of the night. You’re alone. Your blade’s out. Private chat. 
Ali: [laughing] Sure. Ok. Sure. Um-
Austin: Like, that question is broad enough- like, even though it’s called Interrogator, it isn’t written like you have to be interrogating them. I think that breadth is on purpose so that you could use it in a situation like this, and not only in one where you have someone locked up behind bars, you know?
Ali: Ok, yeah. Um, sure. So, I think that like, yeah. Then it was what I said before which is like, Hella grabbing this person’s wrist and like, tugging them- uh, tugging her towards me. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: And then like, holding the sword up like, as if it was like over her shoulder-
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: -with like, the point of it at her neck. 
Austin: Right. 
Ali: And just being like, um, 
Ali (as Hella): You have to describe to me what you did right now. 
Austin: Give me the charisma roll. 
Ali (as Hella): While you still have the time to. 
Ali: And that’s a 5. 
Austin: Oh, that is a 5. 
Ali: [laughing] Minus 1 is a 4. 
Austin: [overlapping] You have a plus 1. Geez, that’s a 1 and a 3 rolled. Um-
Ali: [still laughing] How did that happen?
Austin: Uh- [laughs] um, I think hmm- 
Ali: Hmm. 
Austin: Alright. She says, um- I- Maybe you’ll kill her before she can finish saying this as this blade is at her neck. I’m not gonna make you roll to kill her here, right? Though you failed actually. Um- [laughs] so I can do whatever the fuck I want. Uh, she says, um, 
Austin (as Exarch Braeven): The winter has been long, and the heat needs- And the heat needs-
Austin: I’m trying not to use a specific word here. 
Austin (as Exarch Braeven): The winter has been long, and people know the value of heat. No one need explain why a campfire or a warm soup is good. But the dark? Who cheers for a night like tonight? The dark needs an advocate. 
Austin: And she- as she like, says this, she then is going to stab you again at this close range. You can do damage to her as she does this. But this-
Ali: Ok, yeah. 
Austin: This is- she is like, going to stab you again. Um-
Ali: Yeah. I think that like, the moment her thumb moves- [laughs]
Austin: Right. Yeah, totally. 
Ali: Hella moves her wrist, right? 
Austin: Uh huh. Yeah. 
Ali: Like, she doesn’t even get a chance to- to reach for her weapon. 
Austin: I mean, she does, cause you failed the past roll. 
Ali: Right. [laughs] 
Austin: Um, so she is able to like, slip- maybe she- you know what it is? Like, I think she has a- like a second dagger in her left hand and just like, slams that in your side again. That’s um, 4 dice- er 4 damage, but 1 piercing, so take 2. Um- and you go ahead and- you don’t even need to roll to do your damage. Your damage is just gonna kill her. She’s at 1 HP, so [laughs] you just kill her here?
Ali: Yep. [laughs] 
Austin: Alright. And I think as her body hits the body, the ground finishes shaking as 2 gigantic claws begin to work their way up out of it. Um, and you notice maybe at this moment, where you are standing. And it is underneath the tree that Samol was buried under. Uh, as the bones of a dragon begin to pull themselves up out from the cemetery ground. 
Jack: Ah, Jesus. 
Ali: That’s too bad. 
Austin: Uh, also just super bad news on that skeleton tip. They did not go away when she died. 
Ali: You don’t say. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Um, yeah. I failed some rolls so I would imagine-
Austin: Yeah. Well, no, that wasn’t even that. That’s just the way this worked. 
Ali: No, yeah.
Austin: This is just- I was not- Yeah.
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: I don’t even know that she could have gotten rid of them if she wanted to. Um-
Ali: Oh, good for her. Um- [laughs] Yeah, I guess I’m fighting some skeletons. 
Austin: You’re- Ok, so you’re still gonna. Ok. Alright.
Ali: I sure am in the middle of this field.
Austin: Uh huh. [Jack laughs lightly] 
Ali: Being approached by some skeletons. 
Austin: And like, I- Let me finish describing this- this bone dragon getting out of the ground. 
Ali: Sure. 
Austin: Because that could maybe change some of the calculus. Um- [Ali laughs] Uh, it’s like- it shakes you away. I think like, maybe the skeletons even have to back off to let it come closer basically. Like, finish digging itself out of the ground. Um, it is huge. It is the size that Samol was when Samol was a dragon. Like, it is a big dragon, but it is made of bones, and it has you know, uh the bone skeleton structure of wings. And it- again- it goes to roar, but when it roars, it removes sound from the air. So, it is again, doing this thing where it’s like, you could hear crickets and birds, and then suddenly when it roars, it is- it deafens the space around you. Um, and when it flaps its wings, like it pulls the air towards it. And it does not fly, but it is gigantic. Um, this thing is like- you are- you are a fighter. 
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: This thing is scary. Um, I will note that it is huge. Like, it is- you are small next to it. This is not like a dragon that you could like pet its- its- you couldn’t like hold its head in your arms. It’s bigger than that. I’m not saying don’t fight it. I think this thing is gonna cause some damage, but-
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Um, I do remember this game having specific rules about fighting dragons. Um which is that you can’t. [laughs] 
Austin: Uh, that’s not exactly right. That’s not exactly right. The thing that-
[cross talking] 
Ali: No, no, no, no. Yeah, it’s difficult. Um-
Austin: -you can’t do with dragons- Yeah. Instead it’s difficult, and that things like dragons require special things to hurt them. I think your weird star sword would totally be fine to hurt a dragon. 
Ali: Fair. Yeah. 
Austin: I think this thing is just like- and also, and also, I mean, you don’t know what the fuck this is. You don’t know what this is, so I’m not gonna tell you what it is. But-
Ali: Fair. 
Austin: It’s scary. It should feel- it should be a big scary thing, even for someone like Hella. 
Ali: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure.
Austin: Or maybe- I don’t like- How she responds to it, I can’t tell you. I can’t tell you if she’s scared or not, but it is unlike most foes. 
Ali: Yeah. Well, Hella’s often scared, so you’re fine. 
Austin: Ok.
Ali: Um, [laughs] um, but yeah. I think it is a little rattling in a way that- that’s like, ‘Oh, I fucked this up.’ Right? Like, ‘Oh, a second ago, I saw myself die, and this is- now there’s a dragon here that’s worse.’ Um, like, there’s still- I mean, she- she probably has to kneel over. She gets shaken up. She gets knocked down and has to get back up. And she gets back up. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: And she’s still in the middle of this field. Um, so, I think that she’s hoping that someone will come help her, but like, is still, you know- if there’s a target around to fight, she will do that before-
Austin: Oh boy. Ok. 
Ali: -trying to do something else. Um, yeah. Oops. [laughs] 
Austin: Uh huh. [Ali continues to laugh] 
Ali: Uh, I’m- I’ve only taken 3 damage of 26, so, I’ll be alright. 
Austin: Sure. Yeah. Uh, yeah, so wait. What are you at? You’re at twenty… twenty-four?
Ali: 23 of 26, yeah. 
Austin: Ok. 23 of 26, ok. 
Jack: Jesus, you have so much health. 
Ali: I- Yeah. Uh huh. 
Austin: [laughs] Fighter, you know? So, what do you do?
Ali: [exhales and whispers] What do I do? [normally] Um, I’m just looking over my rules- my stuff really quickly. 
Austin: Uh huh. I’ll note that I marked you as weak because of that poison, which means that your strength is only a +2 right now. 
Ali: [quietly] Ah, sick. Yeah. Ok, cool. [normally] Yeah- Ok, no, I don’t have anything that’s like, ‘dragon’. [laughs] 
Austin: [laughs] No. 
Ali: Besides my sword. Um-
Austin: Right. 
Ali: It- I think I’m- I am going to go for the skeletons, first. 
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: Um, yeah. I think that, in terms of damage [laughs] control, I guess.
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: Um- [laughs] 
Austin: No, this is great. I love it. Go ahead and give me a Hack and Slash. 
Ali: [laughing] Uh huh. 
Austin: Alright, that’s a 9. 
Ali: That’s a 9. 
Austin: A minus one again because- oh, no. You just hit- if you just hit it, it should just work now. Yeah, totally. Awesome. Because it automatically- because I made you- I hit the weak button, so it just automatically lowered your strength thing. So yeah- 
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: That’s actually a 9. Nice. Um, so yeah, you’re gonna deal damage to your enemy, and visa versa, so go ahead and give me your damage roll. 
Ali: 2. 
Austin: Oh my god. Hella. 
Ali: I’m weak. I’m a weak person right now. 
Austin: Ok, well, listen. They did 1, so this is not even gonna be a thing. [Ali laughs] Um, you- you hit- you hit the first one that’s in front of you, which is like, coming at you with just like, its hands to try and like, slam you with like a closed fist thing. And its fists literally just shatter on your armor and like, go to the ground, but then they begin- little bone bits like, start to move back towards the skeleton’s bodies cause that’s how magic skeletons made by this spell work. They reconstruct themselves. Um, but then you’re able to like, slam into it and- and do a little dama- er like, that- that- you’ve done a little bit of damage to it, but you know that with enough time, it will start to heal itself. 
[0:30:00]
Um, the other two, I guess I should roll for all of them, huh? Cause if you’re like, fighting one of them- [Ali exhales] Alright, so both those- Neither of them have piercing, so they are just like- these skeletons are trying to get through your armor, and just fuckin’ cannot do it. But they a nuisance.The real problem is you’ve now- you’ve now turned your back on this big dragon bone thing. Um, and that, you can h- you can feel that it’s lifting up its huge claw to come down at you. What do you do?
Ali: Can I roll out of the way successfully getting myself away from this claw and these skeletons?
Austin: Totally. Give me a Defy Danger dex. 
Ali: Defy Danger?
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Alright, that is a 9. 
Ali: That’s a 9. 
Austin: Um, so you stumble, you hesitated, or you flinch. The- you do the roll and you get some distance from them. And I’m gonna see if there’s something else I can do this with. Um, aw, I have a really important question, but I don’t know-
Ali: Hm?
Austin: Where is all the stuff on your character sheet right now? Sword, you have. Blade in the Dark you have with you. Boundless Fate, that’s in the dock, presumably. 
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: Scalemail, you’re- you’re not wearing that. That’s at home, probably, right. You’re wearing-
Ali: Yeah, I wear the jacket now. Yeah. 
Austin: You wear your jacket. Your dope jacket. Um, which creates some light, which we always forget about. The anchor control plate, probably not with you right now. Right?
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: You do have adventuring gear with a ton of uses left. 
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: You have this dagger from literally the first game. [laughs lightly] 
Ali: Uh huh. I stole it from Samot’s house. 
Austin: You have dungeon rations. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Right. You have a brass telescope. 
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: Useful. 
Ali: Probably at home. 
Austin: Where’s this ring at?
Ali: I think that Hella wears it as a necklace. 
Austin: Um, one of the skeletons get their hand below it and like is pulling at it. You can get away, but you will lose this ring. 
Ali: [exhales and laughs] I- 
Jack: Uh- 
Ali: Go on. 
Jack: Hella has had lots of interesting ring encounters. Which ring is this?
Austin: Sorry. This is the ring that when she wears it, puts a sun in the sky. 
Jack: Ah. Oh no. Ah, it’s this ring. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Yeah, this- this is the one that she’s been holding on for for years as like, an emergency kit.
Jack: Emergency sun?
Ali: Yeah. Um-
Austin: You never know- Listen. Once the sun goes out once, you’re like- you know, we need a fuckin’ back up. 
Ali: Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Austin: TBH.
Ali: This is- this is the skeleton trying to steal Hella’s like, battery that- generator in her basement.
Janine: To steal her sunshine? [lightly sung] Sunshine.
Austin: There you go. Uh huh. 
Ali: Good job. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: Um-
Jack: Bad job. [Janine and Austin laugh] 
Ali: [exhales] I don’t want to lose it. What are my options here? Just stand there and take the hit, I guess?
Austin: You not getting- I guess- I guess it’s- Yeah, you would- You will get hit by this big dragon, yeah. 
Ali: Ugh. I mean, worse things have broken in a fight that can be recovered than a chain in some soil. 
Austin: Yes. 
Ali: Um, so I think that I am gonna get away. 
Austin: Alright. So, it rips off the ring. Um, and you manage to like, roll out of the way. The dragon’s- the dragon’s claw slams into the ground, and you- it- it would have hurt- it would have hurt you. It probably would have hurt you in a way that you don’t get hurt normally. I don’t know. Maybe I would have rolled a 1, and I’m a fucking liar. But it could have hurt you. [Austin and Ali laugh] In a big way. Uh, and you’re able to like skirt away from this thing, and it does its kind of anti-roar again. Are you now just like, running south? What are you doing? Are you gonna go like, yell for the guard? Like, what’s the play here?
Ali: Yeah. I- So, the thing about that is that like, I feel like at the point that there’s a giant dragon, I do not need to make attention. 
Austin: No, this is-
Ali: -on my own.
Austin: No- well, I mean. You know, it’s- it is now- you can probably hear the north- the guards on the northern wall start to like, react now that there is- now that there is something stomping around. 
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: But people are still just kind of getting- yelling and stuff. I think probably Lem, you’re up there. You’re up in the Lending Library, you probably hear people starting to yell. 
Jack: Yeah, just like, wakes up suddenly. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. But we’re talking about a matter of like, 25 seconds have passed. You know what I mean? Or 2 minutes. Like this hasn’t-
Ali: Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Austin: We’ve been recording for 20 minutes, but not for- [Ali laughs] You know, this has all been a matter of seconds.
Ali: Yeah, no, no, no. Yeah, I just mean I’m not running away. Um-
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: So, I think that- [laughs] Hella rolls out of the way, and then it’s like, still kind of low to the ground. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: And gets herself up so she’s like on her feet, but her legs are bent.
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: Um, and kind of like, holds the sword sort of horizontally in front of her, and then you know, lifts up and with that momentum goes for the skeleton that just broke the necklace chain. 
Austin: Ok. Give me a Hack and Slash. 
Ali: God, I’m just gonna keep rolling until I succeed. [laughs] 
Austin: That’s an 11. 
Ali: And that’s an 11. 
Austin: Nice work. Do you get the- your bonus thing is only for like a 12+, right?
Ali: I know. And I would have gotten a 12 if I had a-
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: If I didn’t have the minus 1. 
Austin: Go ahead and give me your damage. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Because you don’t- ah, or I guess, wait. Do you choose one? You choose one. Do you want to do bonus damage or do you want to ex- uh, or do regular damage or do you want to bonus damage but expose yourself to attack?
[crosstalking]
Ali: I think I’m gonna ex-
Austin: I’m gonna say- Go ahead. 
Ali: Expose myself. 
Austin: Ok, I’m gonna say that in this situation, the thing you’re exposing yourself to are the other skeleton attacks, not from the dragon attack. You know what I mean?
Ali: Ok, yeah. That’s what I thought, too. 
Austin: But all three skeletons will get- the skeletons act as a unit, so all of them will get to swing on you in this scenario. They all roll pretty low, but this is- this is the difficulty. If you expose yourself, you’re exposing yourself to a big group of enemies. 
Ali: Ok, yeah. 
Austin: Alright. Wow, that’s good damage.
Ali: Uh, it’s a 13. 
Austin: Yeah. [Ali laughs] And these are all counted separately, so you do 13. You just- What do you do to this first skeleton?
Ali: I think it’s just cut in half, right?
Austin: Cause you’ve killed-
Ali: Like if she’s-
Austin: Yeah, totally. Alright. So, that one is just- you cut it in half, and its bones scatter to the ground. Um, but as you do, I think it’s like- again, it slams its whole body into you as you- as you’re doing that. And the other 2- another- one of the other ones kind of like shoulder charges you. And one its like, its shoulder blade is sharpened, and like, pierces through the backplate of your armor. Um, so total you’re gonna take 6 dama- er no- you have 3 armor, right?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: So, you’re gonna take 4 damage between these- these 3 attacks. Another one had kind of like- swings at you ineffective- ineffectually. Um- Lem, you hear people out-
Ali: And that 13 doesn’t spread?
Austin: Wait, go ahead. Say that again?
Ali: That like 13 damage doesn’t spread to the other ones, too?
Austin: No.
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: That’s a special move that fighters can have if you’d taken that move. 
Ali: Yeah, fair. 
Austin: I guess like, cleave? Is that a move in this? [typing]
Ali: I don’t think so.
Austin: Maybe not. 
Ali: I’ll look into it. 
Austin: But no. You don’t get to spread damage around like that. Um, the- Lem, you definitely hear people starting to yell the word dragon as you wake up in a library. What are you doin’?
Jack: [laughs] Oh god. Well, like, for a moment, I think Lem thinks he’s dreaming. 
Austin: Right. Sure. 
Jack: And then you know when the sound of the alarm clock bleeds into your dream? In this case, it’s someone screaming the word dragon. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Um, and then probably the- well, the dragon doesn’t make a sound, does it?
Austin: No. 
[crosstalking]
Jack: It’s a- it’s a-
Austin: It stops the- It has- the- the ground is shaking.
Jack: -completely sound- It has a stomping sound?
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Jack: Ok. 
Austin: Cause the ground is shaking under its weight. But it is not making any roars, you know?
Jack: Right. Um, and so I think Lem just like- like sits up, slams the book closed, and then goes running for the um- for the like, bunk house. 
Austin: Hmm. 
Jack: Um, to get his stuff, and also just like, Lem is just running, calling out Emmanuel’s name to just be like, It’s not clear. I don’t know whether or not this is ‘Get up’, or ‘Where are you? Are you safe?’
Austin: Right.
Jack: But I think Lem heard someone screaming dragon and has decided to pass on [laughs] that kind of-
Austin: That- yeah. You’re now-
Jack: That kind of-
Austin: Town crier. 
Jack: That kind of tone. Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah, well then, at that point, I definitely think that starts to spread as you run south towards the dormitories. So Adaire, you also at this point can hear people yelling the word ‘dragon’ and ‘wake up’, if you’re that sort of sleeper, you know?
Janine: I mean- prob- probably.
Jack: Some people are just not dragon sleepers. [Janine laughs]
Austin: Yeah. Um, so [laughs] the uh, I guess back in the- y’all can get ready. Get your stuff ready. 
Jack: I just ran in the opposite direction to Ali. 
Austin: You did. Yeah. That is what you did. 100% 
Ali: Thanks. Emmanuel Haters Club. [Jack laughs softly]
Austin: [laughs] Oh my god. You’re just gonna bury my- Just, ugh, god. [Ali laughs] Hella, what are you doing? So, here’s the thing that’s happening. At this point, that big dragon is coming in again- dragon bone is slamming its claws back towards you again. Um, and is going to hit you, if you don’t get out of the way. What do you do?
Ali: Uhh [exhales] Ok. I’m looking at- [laughs] I have that dagger. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: I’ve held onto it for years. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: Can I try to throw it at that dragon’s face?
Austin: Sure. That is a Volley. [Ali laughs] I mean, actually, like yes. What do- what do you want to have happen here? What is your play?
Ali: I want to hit it in like, the eye, but does that seem… too…?
Austin: This is one of those moments where it’s like, I have knowledge that I don’t know if Hella has. 
Ali: It’s very specific, yeah. Um-
Austin: Um, I mean, you’re gonna throw it at it, it’s gonna hit the eye. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: And nothing happens. It bounces off. Because there isn’t really an eye. It’s his eye socket. 
Ali: Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Austin: It’s a big skeleton. Like, it’s- this is not like an undead- this isn’t like a Dark Souls dragon. Do you know what I mean? Like- I mean, it is. It is a Dark- it is a Dark Souls dragon, but it’s not a Dark Souls dragon that‘s like- ‘Ah, yes. The- the un- the Lord of Undead, Dracala. Undead Lord of Dragons and Drakes.’ Like, no. It’s a- it’s animated dragon corpse is what it is. Um, and-
Ali: Ok, can I use this opportunity to Discern Realities to try to figure out how I could weaken this dragon?
Austin: Totally. Give me that roll.
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: That is a wisdom roll. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: But we do get you throwing that dagger, and hear like, ‘clink’ and bounce. [Ali laughs] And then like, it slams down, and you’re able to get out of the way briefly. Or like, back off a little bit. 
Ali: God. Just using my whole inventory tonight. [Jack laughs] 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: I’ve been that person in Breath of the Wild. 
Ali: [overlapping] It’s a 6. 
Austin: That’s a 6. Um, the ring is embedded in its claw, in the bottom of its foot. It like, slams its foot down at you, and you dodge out of the way- or you move out of the way, and it uh- actually, you failed this roll. No, you don’t. [laughs lightly] You’re like, “What’s going on here?’ And it’s like, ‘Dragon. Me. I’m a dragon.’
Ali: Uh hm. Uh hm. Yeah. 
Austin: Uh, and it does 7 damage, three of which is piercing. Um, so take 4. 
Ali: Down to 15. 
Austin: Down to 15. Uh, and it has the ring embedded like- we get- we probably get like, the shot of this. If this was the anime, we would straight up see the ring glow for a moment and then like, embed itself in the base of the- of the dragon’s bone foot. 
Ali: How did it attack me?
Austin: With a big claw. Like it just like, [foley] ‘Bwraaa’ claw. Um, and so yeah. Like, do you- Are you trying to block it? Like, how does that go bad for you? Do you just not get out of the way in time? Like-
Ali: I- I think… and I don’t know if I’m allowed to spin this, but I think that I am. Um, cause I definitely get hit by it, and I think that I take the hit, and try to break off the- the like finger that has the ring on it?
Austin: It is un- it is on the base of the foot. It’s like as if you stepped on it. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: So, you cannot- It’s foot is on the ground, so you cannot just like, hit that part right now. That can be a thing you try to do in the remainder of this exchange. 
Ali: Ok. Yeah, I was thinking like, if the- if the claw like, lands on me or near me-
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: -and hits me, and then I just like grab it and push it back. 
Austin: Yeah. It is like-
Ali: You know? Just crack it.
Austin: So, it is like- Imagine- So, its foot is like, bigger than a car. 
Ali: [laughs] Ok. Uh hm. 
Austin: Do you- That’s why- Like, I’m- when I say it’s huge like-
Ali: Yeah, yeah. 
Austin: -it’s huge. It’s not- it’s not like, ‘Oh, yeah. It’s big. It’s in our room.’ You know what I mean? 
Ali: Right, but-
Austin: Like we couldn’t have this dragon over. 
Ali: Yeah. No, no,. No, no. 
Austin: So, yeah. So you-
Ali: But I feel like… Hella is capable of lifting like, a tree. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: And if a toe is the size of tree-
Austin: It is a-
Ali: She could crack that, right?
Austin: I don’t think it’s on the toe. I think it’s on the bottom of the foot. 
Ali: Fair. Fair, fair, fair. 
Austin: And it’s a huge dragon. 
Ali: I think I’m still doing this. Yeah. 
Austin: So- so, yeah. Give me- Then give me a Def- a Bend Bars, Lift Gates. Cause that- if that’s what you’re doing- 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: With the note that you will get hit while doing this. [Ali laughs ‘Uh huh’] Ok. So, give me Bend Bars, Lift Gates. 2d6+
Ali: But- Ok, that’s the hit that I just took though, right?
Austin: No, that was the hit from failing Discern Realities. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: I’m- I’m saying that you can like, do this, but… it’s gonna hurt you to do- to get in front of a dragon and try to like, lift its foot up and grab this thing. 
Ali: Ok. Ok. I- I’m not gonna. Ok, I’m not gonna argue.
Austin: I get what you’re saying, but you failed that roll. 
Ali: Yeah.
Austin: I make a move as hard as I want. 
Ali: Ok.
Austin: If you’re gonna do a thing that’s gonna put you in danger, like, I have to-
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: I have to- It’s a big dragon. It should be scary. 
Ali: [laughing] Ok. I- Ok. Yeah, I’m willingly staying in danger to try to-
Austin: Yes, to fight a dragon, an undead dragon by yourself. You got a-
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: You got a 12. Nice work. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Alright, so uh, choose 3. It doesn’t take a very long time. Nothing of value is damaged. It doesn’t make an inordinate amount of noise. Or you can fix the thing again, without a lot of effort. I don’t think you care about fixing this foot, right?
Ali: No. I mostly just want to deal any sort of damage. And I think that Hella knows in her head, like, ‘Oh, if I broke a bone in the middle of a fight, I would be hurt.’
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Um, and animals do that, too. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: So, yeah. I don’t think it takes a very long time. 
Austin: Yep. 
Ali: Um, I would hope that nothing of value is damaged. 
Austin: Yep. 
Ali: And maybe it doesn’t make a lot of noise? I don’t know that I care. 
Austin: Yeah. That’s fine. Um, you- Yeah, you shatter one of the- Like, you do shatter one of the core bones on this thing’s foot, and the ring falls to the ground again. Um, but it doesn’t seem to take damage from this. Like, its bone shatters, and it just like, ‘Alright.’ Um, and it’s gonna try to lean down and bite you. Um-
Ali: [whispering] Oh, that’s too bad. 
Austin: What do you do? Because you succeeded here, I’m gonna let you try to react to this. If you had failed, you absolutely would be gettin’ chomped. 
[0:45:00]
Ali: Ok, fair. Can I try to… Can I try to grab my sword and like, make it stuck in its face, you know? Like, if it’s opening its mouth to bite me. 
Austin: Yeah, yep. Totally. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Give me a Hack and Slash. 
Ali: [blows raspberry with mouth] We are in it. Um-
Austin: Uh huh. That’s a 10.
Ali: That’s a 10. 
Austin: Nice work. So, do you want to do extra damage or do you want to prevent this thing from hitting you. 
Ali: I would like to deal my damage and avoid the attack.
Austin: Ok. Go ahead and give me your damage. 
Ali: Ok. [laughs] 
Austin: Um-
Ali: It’s 2. Just kidding. 
Austin: Yeah, it stabs up into the- like the top of the mouth, and it- you can feel like it would give way, but it bounces around the teeth inside of the mouth and can’t quite find- find purchase. Those two other skeletons are also now back to being around you. Um, and are like, boxing you in. We get like, that shot, and then I think- at that point, we cut back to Lem and Adaire who are- Lem is- You have your stuff. Adaire? How’s it goin’?
Janine: Um, I mean, Ad- Adaire has her stuff. I don’t think Adaire- Adaire doesn’t seem like the kind of person who like, when she sleeps like, puts everything in a separate room and like, gets into a nightgown. 
Austin: Yeah, sure.
Janine: And like-
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: Uh, she’s-
Austin: Yeah, Adaire’s ready to go. 
Janine: Yeah, she’s probably got her knives under her pillow. She’s probably that kind of girl. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Janine: Uh, I think Adaire is gonna go find some rope. 
Austin: Ok. 
Janine: Probably like- a lot of like, decently heavy rope.
Austin: Ok.
Janine: That’s what I want.
Austin: Um, you might just have that, right? Do you have dungeon gear? Dungeoneering gear?
Janine: Um, I did. Did I not put it in this new character sheet?
Austin: Maybe. 
Janine: We all did. And I don’t think I ever used it. [laughing] I don’t think any of us ever really used it all that much.
Austin: Yeah. No. No. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, I would say yeah. You can go ahead and add yourself a set of whatever it’s called. Dungeoneering gear. What is it actually called? Adventuring- adventuring gear?
Ali: Yeah, adventuring gear. 
Jack: Adventuring gear? Dungeoneering gear is maybe better. [Austin and Ali laugh lightly]
Austin: Yeah, that-
Ali: Is this still this special moth rope? Is this moth gear?
Austin: You have that moth stuff. I don’t know where- why you have that and other people don’t.
Janine: We had moth rope?
Ali: I do.
Austin: Hella has- Hella has moth adventuring gear. [Ali laughs] Which someone must have given her. 
Janine: Oh, it’s because… I think- I think Hella had to like, get rid of her adventuring gear or something for some reason, and then restocked while we were with the moths. 
Austin: At the moth’s- That makes sense. 
Ali: Oh, right. Yeah. 
Janine: It was just their- Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Ali: I think I lost it on the- [laughing] the hot spring trip?
Austin: That makes perfect sense. Yeah. [Jack and Ali laugh] Uh hm. So, then yeah, those come with 5 uses, so go ahead and just drop to 4 uses on that, Adaire. 
Janine: Ok.
Austin: And write down that you have rope. Yeah. Um, Lem, you have your stuff, are you now heading back north to where the dragon is, or are you like, not doing that?
Jack: Um, I think I want to- I think Lem’s- I think Lem knows that he doesn’t have a super great chance against a dragon, in the same way Hella does. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: So is already thinking like, ‘Can I do work to maybe get people out of the range of this dragon?’ But I would like to check in with Hella before making that decision. 
Austin: Sure. 
Jack: Um, so I’m kind of- I’m running up towards the cemetery. 
Austin: Ok. Cool. Hella? 2 skeletons behind you. 1 dragon in front of you. 
Ali: Hmm, ok. Um, god. Just how much am I fighting to my death? Um… god. It’s so funny because I… am eligible to have a move right now. [laughs] 
Austin: Did you not take one?
Ali: I haven’t yet, and I’ve already blocked it for something that could help me here that I want. Yeah.
Austin: [laughs] Oh buddy.
Ali: Uh hm. Um, unless I looked at other cla- I’m not doing that right now. 
Austin: Right, right, right. I gotcha.
Ali: [laughs] Can I Dead Eyes the dragon?
Austin: So, I thought about this- Uh, I don’t think you can. It is not-
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: -alive. It is not-
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: It is not a living thing, and it’s not an undead thing. 
Jack: Well-
Austin: Which is an important note. None of these things are undead. These are animated bones. 
Jack: Animated things. 
Austin: Yes. These are animated things.
Jack: Ok, so while we’re on kind of- ontological questions, 
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: -can they hear?
Austin: The skeletons certainly can. I think they all can all hear, yeah. Yeah. 
Jack: Ok. Without ears. That’s- that’s the magic. 
Austin: Yeah, it’s magic. Right? They can sense. They have- they have the ability to sense. They are sentient. I don’t think that they are sapient. Hmm.. they might be sa- They have- they have- they’re like well-programmed AI. 
Jack: They know what they’re going for. 
Austin: They have- they have a thing that they’re going for, which is pretty obvious at this point. 
[crosstalking]
Janine: Do they have greater-
Jack: Can they hear the violin?
Janine: Sorry. 
Jack: Oh no. 
Janine: I was gonna say, do they have greater or lesser than animal intelligence?
Austin: They have greater than animal intelligence, but they are not-
Janine: Ok, right. 
Jack: Ok. 
Austin: But they are not- Yeah, uh huh. But they are not um- Uh, see depends. I don’t know, right? Like- hmm- they have different than animal intelligence. What they have is a- like does radiant AI have greater or lesser than animal intelligence? From like- Bethesda games?
Jack: It’s like a different thing, right? It’s like-
Austin: It’s a different thing. That- that’s what I’m saying. Yeah. 
Jack: I’m hesitant to be like, it’s not really intelligence, is it? It’s like- it’s goal-oriented action [somewhat inaudible] or whatever it is.
[overlapping Jack]
Austin: That is what they have.
Janine: You say- Is that the kind of intelligence that you would assign to automatons?
Austin: Yes. Yes.
Janine: Ok. Well, then that’s- I’m gonna read you this- Ok. 
Austin: Yeah, you have a move of some kind, I guessing. 
Janine: Yes, uh, specifically my fear daggers. The description on the fear daggers is ‘These daggers do not affect entities with less than animal intelligence’ Then in brackets, ‘magical constructs, undead, automatons, and the like.’
Austin: So, no. So, yeah. So, it does not affect those, unfortunately. Right? Is that what it’s saying?
Janine: This- I mean, this is why I’m asking do they have greater than or less than animal intelligence because this is defining less than animal intelligence as magical constructs, undead, automatons, and the like. 
Austin: Yeah, it’s definitely in the collection of magical constructs, undead, automatons, and the like. Yes. 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: Yes. 
Janine: But you also just said they weren’t undead. So, I- you can see where I wanted a clear-
Austin: No, but they are- But they are- they are automatons. They are magical constructs slash automatons, yes. They are not- We have a different definition of undead than Dungeon World does. Because our undead are not just like, ‘Buh brains.’ Do you know what I mean? That-
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: This book, zombies have a very like- If you look up zombie in Dungeon World, I think it’s like, thing- its instinct- It has an instinct instead of being a person who has thoughts. All it has is an instinct. And it is- it literally- the instinct in the book for zombies is brains. ‘Braaiiinnnss’ is how it is written out. That is not our- our concept of zombie. 
Jack: Hmm. 
Austin: Um, so- So, cause fear would work on undead in our world. This is just not what we mean by undead in our world. 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: So- good to know, right? Like, so if you ever wanted to cause fear on Emmanuel, you could do it. [laughs] Or Corsica, right?
Jack: Ok. Ok. In that case, I might- Like, do I have an opening here to maybe make a move?
Austin: Let’s- let’s- I’m gonna say we get one more moment of Hella before y’all get there, and then you can be here. 
Jack: Ok. 
Austin: Hella-
Ali: Ok, yeah. 
Austin: What is that moment?
Ali: Um, god. What is it? So, the dragon in front of me, skeletons behind me?
Austin: Yeah, and at this point, whoever you’re not dealing with is gonna be able to get a hit in on you. 
Ali: Yeah. Oh boy. 
Austin: Or sorry- whoever you’re not dealing with is going to be able to pursue their goals. [Ali laughs quietly] That is what I actually mean to say. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Which given the ring is very clearly a goal is something you should be concerned with, right?
Ali: Oh. Um, can I- I’m a professional. Can I um- can I like, bait the dragon to an attack in such a way that it’ll hurt the dragon- er the skeletons?
Austin: Maybe. Um, how are you doing that? What’s that look like? And then we’ll figure out if there’s a move that fits it. Cause I think there probably is. 
Ali: Um, yeah. [laughs] I think that she like, after breaking off a toe, like even if it breaks into piec- it probably breaks into pieces, so she does that, and she like, takes-
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: -a part of it, and like, throws it at it again. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: Um, hoping that she’ll get like, another hand swipe.
Austin: Right. 
Ali: -and will be able to like back up while she’s doing it, you know?
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Into where the skeletons are. It’s very risky. Um- [laughs]
Austin: Oh yeah. 
Ali: But that’s uh, yeah.
Austin: I think this is a Defy Danger.
Ali: Sure. 
Austin: And I think it’s a Defy Danger charisma? Or intelligence. It’s- I think this is intelligence. This is like, quick thinking. 
Ali: Oh. Isn’t intelligence, the magic one?
Austin: No, intelligence is also the magic one. Intelligence def when you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it, and roll. And then there’s a list, and with quick-thinking is intelligence. Charisma is charm and social grace, and this is not charm and social grace, This is quick-thinking. 
Ali: Are you sure this isn’t dexterity to get out of the way. 
Austin: Not is the pla- It would be to get out of the way-
Ali: Right. 
Austin: -but to like, set up a thing where you’re trying to do damage to skeletons? That’s a plan. That’s some Adaire shit
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: That’s intelligence. 
Ali: I sometimes get really good rolls in very- [laughs]
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: -risky situations. 
Austin: What is your- what is your intelligence? I know it’s your lowest, right?
Ali: It’s zero. 
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: It’s not negative. 
Austin: It’s not negative. 
Ali: It’s just a 9, so-
Austin: Yeah, 2d6+ zero. That is a 5.
Ali: [whispers] That is a 5. Ok. 
Austin: That is a 5. Alright. Um-
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: It does the thing. It does do a swipe. Um, it’s just- it like- You’re like, ‘Swipe with your right hand. Swipe with your right hand.’ And it doesn- it swipes with its left hand. Um, so I’m gonna do its damage. That is 10. Take 7. 
Ali: Oh my god.
Austin: As its claws slam into you. And as one of the 2 skeletons runs up and grabs the ring from the ground. 
Ali: [quietly] No. 
Austin: At this point, Lem and Adaire [laughs lightly] you reach the bottom of this hill and can hear the dragon stomping around. And you, at this point, can- there are- there is- I think you probably even hear again the sounds disappears as it roars. Um, Hella, where are you at on HP?
Ali: Uh, 8 out of 26. 
Austin: That 26 just disappears real quick once a dragon is here. 
Ali: Sure does. Yeah. 
Jack: Wow. Ok. So, how many- how many targets are we looking at?
Austin: We’re looking at 3 things. A big-
Jack: 2 skeletons and 1-
Austin: 2 skeletons and a big, bone skeleton. 
Jack: Ok. I think I’m gonna call out to Hella, and I’m just gonna say, 
Jack (as Lem): Which one? [Ali and Janine laugh]
Jack: Oh Jesus!
Austin: I didn’t mean to make that bone skeleton so big, but you know. 
Jack: Hella, have you seen the skeleton take the ring?
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: Uh, oo. Good question. 
Ali: No. No. I mean, I think- I think it’s a priority to me enough that I recognize it going for it?
Austin: Right. 
Ali: Um, but I am at the lowest health that I think I’ve been in 10 years. So- [Jack, Austin, and Ali laugh]
Jack: Ok. I’m gonna extend- I’m gonna continue the question. I’m gonna- I’m gonna go, ‘which one?’
Janine: I mean, there’s 2 of us and 2 skeletons. That seems like- right?
Jack: That’s- yeah.
Ali: The dragon. The dragon. 
Janine: I know, but also the dragon, but first, you know- the little things that die super easy and then maybe the thing that’s gonna take a lot of fuckin’ work to do anything to. 
Jack: [laughing] Little ones first? Or big thing first?
Janine: Little thing with hands that- that grab rings is- I guess we don’t see that yet, but-
Austin: No. 
Jack: Do you reckon you can take the skeletons, Adaire?
Janine: Uh… I mean, part of my concern here is, not if you shout and make them look directly at us. Then it becomes much harder for me to do the thing that makes me good at killing. 
Jack: Hmm. 
Austin: ‘Look over here!!’ [Jack and Ali laugh] 
Ali: Wha- I mean-
Janine: My killing style relies a lot on people not looking at me. [Ali laughs]
Ali: Um, the thing here is that Hella nearly knocked out and poisoned is just yelling ‘The dragon!’ over again. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: So you can do whatever you want and can probably do it sneakily. 
Jack: I might be able to kill 2 birds with- Hmm. [laughs]
Austin: God, we actually get- We get that great moment where it’s like, ‘The dra-’ and then it cuts away cause the dragon is roaring. 
Jack: Oh yeah. 
Austin: Like, and then it un-roars, and you’re- you know- she’s still shouting, ‘The dragon! The dragon!’. Like, but we do get the moment where it roars and cuts off your- the sound in the area. 
Jack: Ok. I’m gonna try and roll Wolf in White Van, I think. Which is a move that Lem hasn’t rolled for… like, actually decades now, right?
Austin: Uh huh. Yeh. 
Jack: Which says-
Janine: What was that move name again?
Jack: Wolf in White Van.
Austin: It is not the real name
Janine: Oh, I didn’t mishear it. Ok. [laughs]
Austin: No. Yeah, it’s- [Jack laughs] We, being nerds, named it after a John- a John Darnielle song- uh, book rather. 
Jack: Which is in turn, named after a message that is hidden in a song. 
Janine:  Hmm.
Austin: Right. Which leads to some negative things happening. 
Jack: So-
Austin: What is the actual name of the book- er the move?
Jack: Oh god. I have no idea. That’s not- I don’t- Uh-
Austin: Ok. Uh- It’s- It is ‘It Goes to Eleven’.
Jack: Ok, so also, you know, it’s reference city-
Austin: Uh uh. 
Jack: -here with this move. When you unleash a crazed performance, a righteous lute solo or mighty brass blast, maybe-
Austin: [laughs] This is why you don’t-
Jack: I’ve used this- I’ve done so many horrible things with this move. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: Um, choose a target who can hear you and roll+ charisma. On a 10+, the target attacks their nearest ally in range. And on a 7-9, they attack their nearest ally, but you also draw their attention and ire. Um… 
Austin: So, who you choosing?
Jack: So, I can actually be pretty specific with who I target here.
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: Um, there’s not a danger of me- of it jumping, like some of my other moves.
Austin: Unless you fail a roll, and then patterns do pattern things.
Jack: Ah ha! That’s how it happens. Ok. Um-
Austin: Just putting everything out there, you know?
Jack: Yeah. Well this- Yeah, this is a very dangerous move, but also I’m watching Hella get killed by a dragon. 
Austin: Oh no. No, totally. 100%. I’m just showing gun barrels over here, you know?
Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Austin: I got rules. 
Jack: Uh, so I think that like, I’m probably gonna target the skele- uh, the dragon. 
Austin: Ok. 
Jack: Um, to pull it off Hella if only for a moment. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: Um, and I’m gonna make a roll. So, we just get like- we get an image of like, Lem clambering up the- Is it is like a barrow? What are we looking at? Is this like a hill?
Austin: It’s like a hill, yeah. 
Jack: Yeah. Uh, kind of clambering up the hill like, pulling the violin off his back. Um, just- like striking the strings hard with the bow. Like, none of this is a pleasant sound. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Like a thing I think a lot when Lem does combat moves is like, this doesn’t necessarily sound good. 
[1:00:00]
Austin: Uh hm. Right, it’s not a nice song. It’s not a- It is not a quote, unquote crazed performance in the sense of like, like a Woodstock, Jimi Hendrix guitar solo. Which is what I think a lot of people do with bards. This is- You’re hitting certain strings, at certain notes, at a certain rhythm, in a certain order or whatever.
Jack: Yeah, like all of us have worked with audio at some point. And I think we’ve all experienced the thing where we do something accidentally and the computer makes such a startling and horrible noise-
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: -that we pull our headphones off. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Um, like that’s this. [Austin laughs] Uh, let’s see how it goes. 
Austin: What is your charisma?
Jack: My charisma is… 16, so I got a +2. 
Austin: Plus 2, ok. 
Jack: Uh, roll charisma. Boop. [laughs] Oh my god. 
Austin: That is a 12! Look at you. Hell yeah. Aright. It uh- What’s this look like? Like what’s it-
Jack: Oh wow. 
Austin: What’s- what’s it do to this nearest skeleton?
Jack: I’m targeting the dragon. 
Austin: I know, but what’s it do to its nearest ally which is a skeleton. 
Jack: Oh! Oh! I think this is just like um- Lem has never done the pattern on a living thing or on a- on a being this massive before. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: And I think at first, Lem doesn’t even know if it’s like worked. The dragon kind of doesn’t really respond until it just takes a side-swipe and obliterates one of the skeletons. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: And Lem’s just like-
Austin: Well, we’ll have to do damage. Let’s see. It probably will do that.
Jack: It’s a dragon, right? Unless it really goofs it. 
Austin: It does. It does. It does. 
Jack: Yeah, so like, a skeleton just explodes. 
Austin: I think it- Yeah, I think it like, yeah. The skele- the bones just go shattering against grave stones and other trees and stuff, you know?
Jack: Which one did he destroy?
Austin: Let’s roll a dice. Let’s find out. Odds, it’s the one with the uh- the one with the ring. Evens, it’s- I mean, I’m just gonna roll- I’m gonna flip a coin, so 1, it’s the one with the ring. Uh, 2, it is the one without the ring. Come on-
Jack: Oh no. That’s a 2. 
Austin: Oh, that’s a 2. 
Ali: Hmm.
Austin: Um, you will see at this moment also that the first dragon- [laughs] the first dragon- the first skeleton is also slowly beginning to put itself back together. It’s not quite a person again yet or a figure again yet. 
Janine: Oh, we got to kick their heads into the river. That’s how you do it. 
Austin: Into the river. Uh huh. 
Jack: Yeah, pick them up. 
Austin: Pick them up. Get ‘em out of there.
Jack: Put them into a river.
Austin: Adaire, what are you doin’?
Janine: Uh, I should deal with that other skeleton. Um, am I like- Where’s the skeleton looking? [laughs lightly] 
Austin: At Hella. 
Janine: It is important. 
Austin: At Hella. 
Janine: Where am I in relation to Hella is the like-
Austin: South of Hella, I think. I think it’s- Oh, let me get rid of one of these skeletons- Let me just move this skeleton over here for now. Um, uh I’ll drop y’all on this little sheet, and we’ll zoom in a bunch. And we’ll talk about where people are. 
Ali: Oh yeah. [laughs] 
Austin: Choo-choo-choo. Make these- make these skeletons smaller so it’s like, more to scale. Make this dragon bigger. 
Janine: I hate that dragon’s tail cause it’s got like a-
Austin: I know. 
Janine: -clampy-
Ali: Yeah. 
Janine: -part on it that I don’t care for. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: It’s like a um- like one of those um-
Janine: Earwig?
Ali: Grab toys. You know the claw machine toys?
Janine: Hmm. 
Austin: Yes. 
Ali: I want a dragon with a claw machine tail. [laughing] That owns.
Austin: Um, Alright, so like, you tell me where you are. You came- I know you’re coming from the south, but like, this is the basic structure, right? There’s a skeleton between-
Janine: Yeah, this is fine. 
Austin: Lem and- yeah. 
Janine: I’m fine with this. 
Austin: Um, and it’s facing Hella, right? So, it’s like-
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: Like this, but not-
Janine: [laughs] Sorry. 
Austin: But not like that. [Janine laughs] You get it. 
Janine: It’s just funny seeing it rotate in place. 
Austin: Actually, there we go. That- that makes it easier. Boom. 
Janine: There you go. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Janine: Um, the way it’s tail gets thin in the middle is also weird. 
Austin: I didn’t draw this dragon, alright? Uh, you know, sometimes dragons just-
Janine: Why didn't you draw a better dragon, Austin? I thought you said you prepped for these.
Austin: I didn’t- I stole this dragon from the internet. I did a search for- for dragon and found the first one that was bones. 
Janine: That’s- Ok. Um, yeah, I want to backstab the skeleton. Very like-
Austin: Ok. 
Janine: I just- I just want to like, run up on that skeleton with my rapier out and fuckin’ like, get it in the back of the skull or something. 
Austin: Ok. Um, is there a- Do you have Backstab as a move? I always forget this.
Janine: Oh yes. I have Backstab and Cheap Shot. 
Austin: What do those do?
Janine: It’s very confusing. Um- 
Austin: [laughs] Ok. 
Janine: When you attack a surprised or defenseless enemy with a melee weapon, you can choose to deal your damage or roll + DEX. 
Austin: Hmm, ok. 
Janine: And then it’s like- and then Cheap Shot triggers on one of these. Cheap Shot is-
Austin: Uh. 
Janine: -when you using your precise or hand weapon, your Backstab deals an extra 1d6 damage. 
Austin: Nice, ok. 
Janine: If I’m- If I make damage, then I get extra damage. 
Austin: Right, so the thing that you’re getting is- The way that Backstab works is like, ‘Hey, it’s- it is surprised or defens’- It’s surprised right now right? Um so- because it’s facing Hella. So, you can just do your damage, if you want to, which will give it- will also do an extra +1d6 damage or you can roll DEX which would prevent you from- which would let you choose between… um, god. You- So, you could roll DEX [laughs] and succeed which would give you an extra 1d6 damage and you get to choose 2 of these. Or if you get a 7-9, you get the +1d6 damage and you get the 1 of these other ones, which is either you don’t get into melee with them, you deal another 1d6 damage, you create an advantage, plus one forward to any ally acting on it, or you reduce their armor until they repair it. Um, so it’s like you could just do damage. If you just want to do damage, you can just do damage, you don’t have to roll for it. 
Janine: Yeah, these skeletons haven’t been like super sturdy, right? So, it’s-
Austin: No. Uh- sturdier than like, those bandits that they fought last week or like, the bird guards, but not that much sturdier.
Janine: Yeah. So, I would get my damage plus my Cheap Shot?
Austin: Yes. Totally. 
Janine: Or I can roll and do-
Austin: Even more. Yeah. 
Janine: Hmm. I have good DEX.
Austin: Cause what is your- Your normal damage is d8? Yeah. You do have a good DEX. It’s true. You do have 18 DEX, the highest it gets. 
Janine: I mean, I have 18 DEX. I should probably just do this, and if it goes bad, well then that’s just the day we’re all having, right?
Austin: Uh huh. Give me that- that roll. [Ali laughs] 2d6+3. 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: There you go. That’s a 10. 
Janine: That’s a 10. Alright. 
Austin: Alright, so you’re already gonna do d8 plus d6 damage. What of the other 2 things do you want to do? Not get into melee with them? Do another 1d6 on top of that? Create an advantage to an ally- for an ally? Or reduce their armor. 
Janine: Uh, I want to create an advantage for Hella. 
Austin: Ok. 
Janine: That seems like the thing to do, and also the thing that makes the most sense. 
Austin: Uh hm. We’ll fill in what that advantage is in a moment, but mark it. And then?
Janine: Uh… if I do an excessive amount of damage, can I also destroy their skull? If I like, really really overdo it?
Austin: I’m gonna say, yes you can do that. That will not kill this thing. 
Janine: Oh. 
Austin: It isn’t like- there isn’t a brain in there. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: That you’re waiting to destroy. 
Janine: I thought we’re doin’ Breath of the Wild rules.
Austin: I know. I know. I love Breath of the Wild a lot.
Janine: [sighs] Um- do they have armor? They’re just bones.
Austin: Um, the thing- They have 1 armor. Yeah. They are magic-
Janine: We have bones, and we don’t have- Ok. 
Austin: You are not magically animated. 
Janine: [laughing] I know. I know. Um-
Austin: Um, the person who would be able to do something really good here if you rolled really well was Hella who has that thing that’s like, when you Hack and Slash and get +12, then you get to do blah-blah-blah. 
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: So, that’s like- The reason I’m like, ‘ah, you don’t get anything extra there’ is because that is a specific move that a specific class has. I’m not gonna like, undercut that move by passing it around. 
Janine: So, like- Ok. So, hmm. This is a mechanical question that I don’t know if you can answer. If it has like, 6 hit points, and I take- and I get like, 12, does it just bottom out at 6, and then it restores itself? Or is there-?
Austin: It bottoms out at- You mean- what do you mean? Like it will die, and then I- and then it will continue to try to-
Janine: And then come back. 
Austin: -to try to bring itself back together. Yes. 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: There are- I have rules for how that functions
Janine: So, so overdoing it doesn’t really benefit me at all?
Austin: Not particularly, no. Um, I think like, you know like, I will- I will take note of the fact that that skull is gone. There are ways in which that could benefit- That could benefit your situation. I’m not gonna say it wouldn't benefit your situation at all. 
Janine: I’ll just reduce it’s armor. 
Austin: Ok. So then, so d8 plus d6.
Janine: How do I roll…?
Austin: Uh, so slash- slash roll d8 + d6.
Janine: I was just gonna roll them separately cause I have my move for cheap shot. 
Austin: Yeah. Also fine, yeah. 
Janine: Which I think should work?
Austin: Uh, I think that will roll- No, that’ll just do your-
Janine: No, that-
Austin: t just tells you what the move is. [Janine sighs] Uh, you can just hit your dice- your damage roll up top, if you want to hit that. Oh, you-
Janine: I did. That was- that was my first one. 
Austin: Oh. Ok, then-
Janine: That was what I got for the 7. 
Austin: Gotcha. Gotcha. 
Janine: And a 1. 
Austin: And that’s an 8. Alright. 
Janine: Er, 8. Wait, what?
Austin: Um, which is an 8 total. 7 plus 1 is 8. 
Janine: Ok, sorry. Yeah. 
Austin: Totally. Um, so yeah, I think- I will now tell you, these things have 7 HP. You- you hit that on the nose cause it has 1 armor, which you strip away, and also you kill it anyway. So, um, and what is the advantage you’re creating for Hella? So, yeah, you smash this thing or you stab it or whatever you do. It falls to the ground, and the ring- the ring also falls to the ground and like, rolls a little distance away and stops. 
Janine: Um… Hmm. That’s a good ques- question.
Ali: Um, I think Hella right now- at an opportunity um, would probably like, roll on the ground towards the ring, and grab it. And then probably like, get into the fetal position. [Austin and Ali laughs] Cause she is really hurt-
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: -and her friends are here.
Austin: Um, you should- you should- if you want, you can take that +1 forward to getting to the ring safely. 
Ali: Ok, cool. 
Austin: Right? Actually, you know what? You don’t even need that right now because- because Lem’s thing um, has the- had the dragon distracted for a second. So, you’re like- You are not being actively tar- you will be again targeted actively in a moment. But in this moment, I’m gonna let you get that ring without having to roll for it. Um, but you’ll still get a +1 forward, so maybe it’s just like, ‘Oh shit. My friends are here. Ok. Ok. Ok.’ 
Ali: [laughs] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um- yeah cause I really- I don’t know- She’s not- I don’t know that she’s making another attack right now. Um-
Austin: Yeah. Also, really quick, just for some color, like, some arrows start hitting this dragon from the wall as people are lining up with bows and arrows, and the arrows aren’t doing shit. The arrows are like, blink- plink plink… plink. Plack. And just like, falling off. Someone has the bright idea to shoot a fire arrow. It doesn't do anything. Like, again, it just like goes in one side of the dragon and out the other. And also, it’s- the other thing is like, shooting arrows at a big bone dragon is hard because it’s just- like, there’s gaps all through it, you know?
Janine: Yeah, should really be going rocks or something.
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Yeah. So, we all get hit by arrows. 
Austin: You all get killed. 
Ali: End of the game. 
Austin: End of the game. The end. Boy, the- when fuckin’ Alcyon party comes back, they sure are gonna find a different home. Um-
Ali: Dragon lives here now. 
Austin: [laughs] What do the three of you do as this dragon, again, roars at this point? And then like, re- does the thing where it like- it does like a quick pace back and forth, and kind of addresses itself to you. And spreads its wings out extremely wide. And then like, takes a fighting stance.
Ali: Ugh. [Janine laughs] 
Jack: Jesus. Did- Wha- [sighs] Did you have a plan with the rope, Adaire?
Janine: I did, but I feel like we should- I feel like it’s an incredibly bad plan that will get me killed because I only have 15 hit points. [laughs] 
Jack: What’s the plan? I mean, let’s just- Ok, I guess I’m just calling this over to you. 
Jack (as Lem): What’s the plan, Adaire?
Janine: Uh, real quick. Who has the best INT?
Jack: Let me check. 
Ali: Not me.
Janine: I have 13. So, I have like, a +1. 
Austin: You and Lem both have a +1. 
Jack: Yeah, I also have 13 in INT. We are equally INT.
Janine: I was already thinking like, If someone could spout some lore about bone dragons that we got while passively reading at the university or whatever. 
Austin: You could- Someone could spout lore, for sure.
Ali: If it’s a bone dragon, does that count as being- it only counts as if it’s Adelaide’s spot, right? It’s not just like, dead things in general. 
Austin: Yeah, it is not just dead things in general. [Ali sighs] 
Jack: I’ll give a shot at spouting some lore about this dragon. Lem, ever the optimist. 
Austin: Uh huh. [Janine laughs] 
Ali: Yeah. 
Jack: [laughing lightly] Just be like, let me tell you about this dragon. Um, jeez. Ok. When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something- I love this cause-
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: Lem is an amateur dragon seer. He is- he is- [Austin laughs] He has understood that dragons exist, but has had- I don’t- This might be the first time Lem’s seen a dragon, right?
Austin: Yeah. It is. 
Jack: Ok, in that case, I think this is- This plays to an advantage cause Lem is very excited, as well as- [Austin and Jack laugh lightly] as well as being afraid. 
Austin: Great. 
Jack: Um, so I’m gonna roll my INT. Uh, let’s see how this goes. 
Austin: Yep. That’s a 9. That ain’t bad. Um, so I’ll only tell you something interesting. It’s on your to make it useful. Um-
Jack: Oh my god. Why did I roll spout lore 26 times?
Austin: Oh my god. Why did you-?
Ali: [laughing quietly] Oh my god. 
Janine: Did you like, click the thing instead of expanding it?
Austin: Wait. Ok, wait. I can’t count that 9 then because you rolled- Ok, 8.
Janine: The first one was an 8, so it’s- it doesn’t matter. 
Austin: Ok, you’re fine. You’re good. You’re good. You got a bunch of successes in a row. 
Jack: And 1 failure. 
Austin: And 1 failure, but we’re not gonna count that one, so something interesting. It’s up to you to make it useful. Um, this is a magical dragon. This is a magical bone dragon. 
Janine: Wow. 
Jack: I think Lem is relaying this [Austin laughs] with this level of expertise to Adaire. 
Jack (as Lem): This is a magical dragon. [laughs] 
Austin: It is- um, alright. So, it is an automaton. Like, this is the thing is you’re- I’ve said to you about the world, I’m telling you you now know it about the dragon. This dragon is not a thinking being. This dragon is a-  is an automaton that has been uh- it’s basically the bones are being held together by a spell and animated to act the way a dragon does. But currently, in its current form, it is not a sapient being. Um, and it is serving some other master. 
Jack: As far as we can- ah, I’m not allowed to ask follow-up questions. 
Austin: No, how do you know this, by the way?
Jack: Um, hmm. Oh, I know.
Janine: Lem did fall asleep with a book. 
Jack: Uh, I did fall asleep with a book, but this goes way further back. Which is uh- when Lem was a kid, he saw a senior semioticians at the Archives play a trick, like make a trick. 
[1:15:00]
Austin: Hmm. 
Jack: Where they um, empty a matchbox onto a table and animate it- animate the matches-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: -into like little horses or like a dog or like a tiny match dragon. Um, and I think what Lem puts together is like, it’s just that. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: It’s- it’s-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: It is just a match stick horse, except it’s like, the size of a building, and it’s killing my friends.
Austin: Yeah. There is something very funny about this encounter, by the way, that I will explain once we’re done. 
Ali: Hmm. 
Jack: [laughs] Ok. I think- Do I get the sense that this spell is coming from somewhere? Or was it that person who Hella killed and the spell is just continuing?
Austin: You don’t know enough from here. You couldn’t say. 
Jack: Ok. 
Janine: I was gonna hogtie the dragon. 
Austin: Great. 
Ali: Hmm.
Jack: Yeah. Let’s do it. Let’s do it. Let’s do it. 
Ali: Yeah.
Jack: The only thing worse than a dragon is our dragon, and he hates us. [Austin laughs lightly]
Austin: Mom! I foun- Mom, I found a dragon, can I keep it? Please?
Jack: Awful silence roar, ground shakes. 
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: Can I- Just while we have the space, can I Discern Realities from the floor? Just so we have a- we’re acting on as much-
Austin: What’s- Uh huh. 
Ali: -possible knowledge as we can?
Austin: Yes, you can totally do that. With a note that a failed roll again, blah blah blah. 
Ali: Oh my god. 
Austin: Discern Realities with wisdom. 
Janine: Hella tries to think and then dies. [Janine and Jack laugh] Is that the implication?
Austin: Well, it’s like- it’s like- Discern Realities means you’re like, looking at stuff, right?
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: You’re like, I’m not acting. I’m gonna do my best to just like, get an understanding of the situation. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Stuff- Clocks tick. 
Jack: What’s my wisdom? Is this a situation where uh, Aid and Interfere might-?
Ali: Oh, I- Yeah, I have people here to assist me now. 
Austin: Yes, you do. 
Ali: Ok, so I’m just gonna roll it, cause yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Yeah, I have 1 wisdom, so, worse comes to worst-
Ali: Ok. And if it happens, we all have bonds, and [laughs] you can assist me if I fail. It’s a 9.
Austin: It’s a 9. So, yeah. Do you just- does someone want to help to see if we can pump that up to a 10? Oh, you have plus 1 forward. That’s a 10. 
Ali: Ok, cool. 
Austin: Yeah. You have the safety basically of- of having your friends here. You’re like, ‘I can do this. I can fucking see through this’. So, go ahead and ask me 3 of those questions. 
Ali: Ok. [whispers] Jesus. 
Austin: And remember to take +1 forward when acting on the answers. 
Ali: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, what here is useful or valuable to me?
Austin: [breathes deep and exhales] Um, I- So, the obvious thing is this ring, right? You know that they want it. 
Ali: Wait, I only get one question?
Austin: No, you get three. You get three cause you got a plus 1 on this. 
Ali: Ok, ok, ok. 
Austin: So, yeah. So, it’s this ring, but there’;s also something- Well, it’s like, this ring, a way out of here- um, the big one is, I think this is a moment where you realize like, ‘I bet dragon bones are really good.’ [laughs] Like, for build- like, you think about- you fucking stabbed that thing on the interior of its mouth, and it didn’t do damage. like, obviously you don’t know- It didn’t- it didn’t draw blood. It didn’t break through. Dragon bone must be made of tough stuff. 
Ali: Uh hm. 
Austin: That’s not necessarily valu- useful in like, the ‘and this is how I can beat this dragon’, but it is- it is valuable in that like, ‘Oh, dragon bone seems like a rare and valuable resource.’
Janine: Also, it’s green with a red iridescence. [Austin and Ali laugh quietly] That’s a Dragon Age joke for all-
Austin: Uh huh. Yeah, I got it. Uh huh. 
Ali: Ok, um- Thank you, Janine. [laughs] Uh, what here is about to happen?
Austin: Um, [exhales] it is going to attack you and try to get the ring. And then probably try to leave. Um-
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: You get that by like, watching its pacing in the way that it is like, you know- it isn’t trying to formulate a plan the way a- I mean, it is trying to formulate a plan the way a person does or the way, again, a very advanced computer would. Where it’s like running scenarios in its head, basically. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Uh, trying to think of anything else- The other- Here’s the other one- Here’s the thing that you actually think about. If it goes in any direction, it’s going to start hitting the refugees who have camped all along the outside of your walls. That is the other thing that is about to happen. It is a gigantic dragon, and there are lots of innocent and um, you know, unprotected people in between you- in between this dragon and basically any direction that isn’t north. 
Ali: Ok, um, and just, you know, for sh- for fun, what here is not what it appears to be?
Austin: Um, hmm. I mean, I guess it’s worth giving you this, which is like, these are… these are the bones of Samol. This is not Samol. This is not the person, Samol. This is not a mind controlled Samol. Whatever that spell was turned Samol’s body into its dragon form and then animated its bones. Or those bones. Um, but like, there should be no part of you that is like, ‘Oh, but what if this is secretly Samol.’ No. 
Ali: Right. 
Austin: This is a collection of bones that are valuable to someone, right? Um, and maybe there’s a moment here where like, it even- [laughs] it like,snatches up its broken foot with- with its jaws and almost like- like puts it inside of its own mouth, almost like for storage, as if it doesn’t want to leave any pieces behind. Which makes you start thinking like, ‘Oh, is this a bone heist?’ [light laugh] 
Ali: Hmm. Oh, yeah. Hella’s very familiar with bone heists. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Um, I remember the old magical bone job in ‘003’.
Austin: Uh huh. [laughing] 
Ali: Um, god. Ok. I’m fully- I’m glad to have this information. I am fully team hogtie dag- the dragon. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: And with my positioning, I think that I with my 8 health points, I’m willing to… act as a distraction. 
Jack: You’re willing to consider?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Ok. 
Jack: To consider plan hogtie the dragon?
Ali: Yeah. 
Jack: Can we heal Hella in combat? Are there any mechanics for healing in combat in Dungeon World?
Austin: Jack. I really want you to look at your sheet. [Ali laughs]
Jack: Austin. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Now, here’s the thing.
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: [pauses and laughs] Here’s the thing. 
Austin: What’s good?
Ali: Uh hm. 
Jack: You know, when I-
Austin: I can open a move for you, if you want me to. 
Jack: No, no, no. I don’t- I do not need that at this stage. I might have done 15 minutes ago. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: Um, when I think about healing in an RPG-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -I think about a red potion.
Austin: Yeah.  [Everyone laughs]
Jack: And I- I do not have any red potions. What I do have however-
Austin: [overlapping] Is that true? Do you not have- You might have some red potions in here. I don’t even know. No, you don’t have any red- red potions. 
Jack: That I have some red potions?
Austin: No, you don’t have any of those. But you do have Arcane Art.
Jack: Also-
Austin: And Invigorate. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: Which are both things that help people. 
Jack: Wha- eh- [blows out air and laughs] Arcane Art is a terrifying spell. 
Austin: Ok. Yes. 
Jack: Uh… but I- Hmm. Here’s the thing. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: I could try and heal Hella.
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: But try is a very operative word here. Um, Hella, do you know the risks of this move?
Ali: Wel- I assume we’re making a team action to hogtie this dragon. 
Jack: Yeah, but I wanna- I want- I want you to be in fighting fit state for dragon hogtying. 
Ali: Oh, fair. Yeah. Ok. Um, what are the risks that I should be aware of, Lem King?
Jack: So- [laughs] That’s- Yeah, that’s on my business card. Um- [Ali laughs] On a 10+, the ally gets the selected effect which in this case would be healing. 
Ali: Uh hm. 
Jack: Um, and on a 7-9, the spell still works, but I draw unwanted attention or my magic reverberates to others targets, affecting them, as well. GM’s choice. 
Ali: That’s risky.
Jack: So, I might be able to make you stronger, but I would also make dragon stronger. 
Janine: The dragon hasn’t really been hurt at all though, right? Other than its foot got smashed?
Ali: Yeah, I- I can.
Austin: Yes, the note that I think Jack is making really quick is that Invigorate, which gives you +2 forward to damage-
Janine: Oh. 
Austin: -would also affect the dragon on a 7-9. 
Janine: [sighs] 
Ali: Well, that’s the thing- I don’t- I don’t want a dragon- I don’t want to damage this dragon right now. I want to do Jurassic Park [Austin and Jack laugh] which is run away and make a dragon chase me so you can hogtie. 
Jack: Aw, let’s do Jurassic Park. [Ali laughs] Ok. Ok. So, if anything, that move would- would help you in that case, cause you’d get- you’d have the health needed. And it doesn’t matter what the dragon’s health is. 
Ali: Right, because it would be hogtied. I think? [laughs] 
Janine: It actually would be more helpful if you could have run in circles, so we don’t run into the other- [laughs] building. Like, big circles.
Ali: Yeah. I- I so deeply- [laughs] I so deeply don’t want to risk invigorating a dragon.
Janine: Yeah. 
Jack: So-
Austin: So, you’re just gonna run for it. You don’t want to be healed?
Ali: Yeah, I guess.I- In- [laughs] In terms of risk-reward here, I either run away hurt- and I run away and I’m hurt. And my intention was to run away, and it’s fine. Or I run away healed, but the dragon is stronger. 
Austin: Hmm. Hmm. 
Ali: And I’m running. 
Austin: Well, that only happens if Jack gets a 7-9/ If Lem succeeds, gets a 10, then that doesn’t happen. You get stronger. 
Ali: Right.
Austin: But that’s it. 
Jack: The other thing is like, Austin, how effectively could I make a case that what- what is being described in the 7-9 of Arcane Art would not affect Invigorate?
Austin: Uh, I don’t think there’s any chance. You could make that-
Jack: Ok. That’s not worth-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: That’s not worth- [laughs] devoting any time to?
Austin: Your magic- your magic reverberates to other targets-
Jack: Yeah, that’s what I thought Yeah. 
Austin: -affecting them as well. GM’s choice. It even says GM’s choice. 
Jack: It’s GM’s choice there that’s the problem. Ok.
Ali: [quiety] Yeah.
Austin: I get it. 
[crosstalking]
Jack: So, if-
Ali: I-
Austin: If you’re playing- if this was not such a- This is supposed to be scary, right? Like, I want you to be scared right now. You should be. This is a good-
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: -interesting dilemma. 
Jack: The tone of this scene is-
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: -is fear. Yeah. So, I guess we- we actually get Lem just like, bow to strings looking at Hella to be like, ‘do you want me to do it?’
Ali: [laughs] And then, no, I think that she- she shakes her head and she gets into like- She’s not a runner-
Austin: Right, but she’s wearing that Nike-
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: That Nike Fit, so-
Jack: Yeah. 
Ali: There’s a very specific like, tips of fingers on ground-
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Knee bent. 
Jack: Oh yeah. 
Ali: Like, yeah. I- you don’t have to do it. This is the plan now.
Austin: [quietly] Oh man.
Ali:  [laughs] Um, and yeah. 
Austin: Um, alright. So, what you’re trying to do is distract this thing so that they can better get it, right?
Ali: Uh hm. 
Austin: I think this is Defy Danger DEX, right? Because you’re trying to run fast. 
Ali: Uh hm. 
Austin: With the note that on a- I mean, we’ll just talk about it when you roll, but- but-
Ali: Ok.
Austin: This will be helping them. It’s producing the opportunity, but depending on your level of success, it could also literally give them a bonus.
Ali: Ok, cool. 
Austin: Your DEX is 2?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Alright. Let’s do it. 
Ali: Defy Danger is on charisma which is wrong. DEX. It’s a 10.
Austin: Hell yeah. That’s a 10. Alright. 
Jack: Woah. 
Austin: So, what’s this look like? You just like, sprint?
Ali: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think she just starts running. 
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: Um, I- I don’t know what direction she runs in because… there are a lot of places not to be running.
Austin: I’m gonna tell you-
Janine: I think Adaire’s just off to one side like, making a circle hand gesture. [everyone laughs quietly] Like- kind of like, an umpire bringing everyone home kind of thing. 
Austin: Uh huh. Yeah, where are you going? You tell me. You can see the map. You can see where there are people. You can see- you can make decisions here.
[crosstalking]
Ali: And the- the glow here is- god, this is the star shield and not the-
Austin: Yeah, the outer, orange wall is the star shield. 
Ali: -the wall-wall. Ok.
Austin: The grey wall is the wall-wall. 
Ali: Um, cause I feel like, end of the road, it’s running towards the water, but it’s like north through these tents to avoid them, right?
Austin: That’s you’re- you’re saying that’s what you want. You want to go north through the star shield- like you want to like, up and around?
Ali: No, because- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
Austin: Sorry. 
Ali: Because that’s away from Lem and Adaire, so that doesn't make any sense. I think the thing that I do is, I take off towards the- If it’s- if it’s diagonally towards- if it’s diagonally like, between the temple and the trading house, that would be towards Lem and Adaire. Like, through Lem and Adaire, so the dragon-
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: -would go towards them, and then they can do whatever rope-
Austin: Yeah. Totally. 
Ali: -tripping. 
Austin: Ok. So, you’re going southeast, but kind of like, letting them do a tripwire type thing. 
Ali: Yeah.
Austin: Take +1 forward, Lem and Adaire, on your attempt to hogtie a bone dragon. 
Janine: Ugh. 
Austin: I guess, it’s gonna take multiple rolls? I think there is a- You’ve got the- the ‘you’ve got the rope on it’ roll, and then there’s going to be a much harder, ‘I am stronger than a dragon’ roll. 
Janine: Yeah, so like, my- [laughs] my plan hadn’t- I don’t- I don’t know if the tripwire is a better plan than the one I had. 
Austin: Wait, what’s your plan?
Janine: My plan was to jump on a dragon’s leg, tie the rope around its knee, and then like, go to another knee. 
Ali: Ohh.
Austin: No, yeah. Totally. 
Janine: And then like, drawstring it. Or clothesline it. 
Austin: That’s- Right. Both of those, there will be a moment at which strength-
Janine: Yeah, but I- what I’m saying is, I don’t know if that’s a better or worse plan-
Austin: Oh, I see. 
Janine: -than the other thing cause also this is a winged dragon. [laughing] So, I feel like there a chance it’ll just fuckin’ fly over the thing.
Jack: It’ll just go.
Janine: Um, I’m not really sure what- like, cause I don’t-
Austin: Yep. 
Janine: I was gonna ask, how does this- how has this dragon been mooing- moving? 
Austin: Uh hm, mostly like a dragon so far. 
Janine: Or do the wings works if there’s no like, webbing?
Austin: I- You- That’s a roll. That would be one of those things where if you had spouted lore and gotten a 10, I would have told you. 
Janine: But like, observedly, it hasn’t yet. It still could?
Austin: It has made some big leaps. You have not seen it-
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: You’ve seen it display its wings. You’ve not- Like, you have seen it do like, ‘Oh, I’ve got big wings.’ But you have not seen it fly. It’s not been doing dive bombs attacks, you know?
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: If Fero had turned into this, it would have been 7 dive bomb attacks by now. If it can fly. 
Janine: Sorry, my- I have to- Uh, god, yeah. Ok. So, I- What do we think the better option is here? Jumping on and doing stuff or like, tripping it and doing stuff?
Ali: It feels like they could be combined, right? Whereas like, as soon as-
Austin: Yeah, y’all got rope, right?
Ali: Yeah.
Jack: Yeah, like as soon as it goes down, we like-
Janine: What if- ah god, what if- I’m gonna regret this so much. What if the roll is, me and Lem are each holding an end of the rope, and we’re trying to trip the dragon. And when the dragon falls, we each have to like, do a loop around and then tie on a joint.
[1:30:00]
Austin: I mean that- That can totally work-
Janine: Because then that’s three rolls, right?
Austin: I- I am- I am- One, I don’t want to talk about what the rolls look like until we know what the thing is. We should be going fiction first, and then defining that with rolls. But the thing that I want to note is like, the thing you just described feels like a strength thing because pulling- not just being thrown away by a huge dragon- like-
Janine: Yeah, that’s the other reason I was thinking that the thing to do is like, climb on it because that’s DEX. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah, that- Climbing on it would definitely be DEX. I think setting up a trap where you’ve- you’ve set up a set of- um, a set of tripwire- er like, you set up as like, a tripwire- you tie it around something that you think is sturdy enough to hold- to actually trip it. 
Janine: We’re on a- we’re on a grave hill. There’s nothing here, but graves.
Austin: You’re on a grave hill. And trees.
Jack: There’s a tree. 
Ali: Oh, there’s other trees, yeah.
Austin: There are trees.
Janine: Where’s the tree?
Austin: There are trees on this hill. 
Janine: Ok.
Jack: It’s the- the tree. 
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Jack: Samol’s- The tree Samol’s buried under.
Janine: Right, right. Yeah. 
Austin: I mentioned that there were trees on here before. 
Janine: Yeah, ok. 
Austin: Um, and then- and then, there are mausoleums and graves and stuff. Like, that are probably tougher than either of you holding a thing. Um, or yeah, climbing on it is definitely a thing. Uh, you could try to lasso it, but like, at some point, it feels like strength is going to get involved in this plan. I just want to make sure that that is- maybe the situation where it’s like, you know at that point, Hella, who is strong, can probably- can maybe get involved. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: Right?
Janine: Yeah. Ok. So, the smarter thing then is the- [exhales] using DEX to get it off its feet and then strength to keep it off its feet. 
Austin: Right. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Janine: Like, we should be looking for a plan that does- that accomplishes that. 
Austin: Both of those, yeah. 
Jack: And like, I’m not Hella strong, but I’m fairly strong. 
Janine: Stronger than me.
Jack: I’m stronger than I am dexterous. 
Austin: Right. Right. 
Ali: Yeah. And I can certainly- if this happens successfully, I could wrap back around to help with the-
Austin: Yeah, definitely. 
Ali: -the second part of that, yeah. 
Austin: And y’all get a plus 1 forward on this, right? The thing- the one place where I’m- the thing that I- I- Yeah, so I think- I think what you just said is the right play. The thing that I was just thinking was like, I shouldn’t even let you just try to like, ‘You hold one end. I hold the other. We’ll be strong enough to stop it.’ Cause that’s not true.
Janine: Yeah, no. No.
Austin: There’s no way the two of you are strong enough to do that. That’s not a roll. But climbing up- running at this fucking thing and trying to jump on its legs as it runs past is a wild-ass plan, and I’ll let you try. [Ali laughs] Um, so you each jumping to one leg? Or is one person gonna try to do one and then the other?
Janine: Um, I wasn’t gonna make Lem do the jumpy one. 
Austin: Ok. 
Jack: Good. 
Janine: Maybe… Hmm. Well, no that wouldn't work. 
Austin: Jack, you just shot arrows? Why did you volley?
Jack: It’s because- so here’s what I keep doing.
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: I keep trying to expand the moves-
Austin: I see.
Jack: -by clicking the name instead of the little circle. 
Austin: The arrow, yeah. 
Ali: Oh. 
Jack: Those weren’t real arrows. I don’t have a bow, and if I did, I wouldn't know how to use it. 
Austin: Ok. Good. 
Janine: I think- Ok, I think- I think I have the thing. I think the thing is to jump on one leg-
Austin: Yeah. Yeah.
Janine: -tie the rope around the joint, but use the middle of the rope-
Ali: Yes. 
Janine: -so there are 2 long, loose ends. And then, Hella and Lem can get those loose ends and like, yank it off its feet, and then we finish the job. Right?
Austin: So, you’re just gonna tie it around one leg, and you’re like, yank!
Janine: Well, yeah cause-
Austin: Like a snare.
Janine: -There’s like, loose ends, so like, we could tie one end-
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: -to something strong and then use the other to bind up the rest of its legs or something like that. 
Ali: Right.
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[crosstalking] 
Ali: Yeah, we just want to get the rope on it-
Austin: First. 
Ali: -sturdy enough that we can-
Austin: Yes. 
Janine: And also-
Ali: -tie the other legs. Yeah. 
Janine: Yeah, if- if we succeed in getting the rope on there, then initial points of failure can- [exhales] There’s- it feels like there’s a little more room to adjust the plan.
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Go ahead and give me that DEX then.
Janine: -if shit goes terribly wrong. Ok. 
Austin: 2d6 plus- plus your DEX is 3, right?
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: Plus 3, plus 1.
Janine: Did that roll correctly? Oh, It’s a 12. 
Austin: That-
Ali: Oh, a 12. 
Jack: Woah.
Austin: It sure did. That is a 12. Adaire, what’s this look like as you jump on this dragon leg?
Janine: So, I think Adaire uh- from the start of this, she- she’s like, ‘Ok, dragon. I’m probably gonna want this rope.’ Um, I think she has wound the rope around her waist and like-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Janine: -like- since she’s been here, so it’s out of the way, but still accessible. Um, so I think the thing that she does is as the dragon is like, trying to follow Hella, she like, runs up alongside the- the sort of back legs. I keep looking at that nice bent one that looks very climbable. 
Austin: [laughing] Uh hm. 
[crosstalking]
Janine: Or that straightened out one. Like, you know, that like-
Austin: I didn’t draw- this is not. Ok. [resigned] Oh boy. [laughs]
Janine: What? [laughs] 
Austin: It’s not an exact replica of this sketch. [Ali laughs]
Janine: [laughing] I know. I’m just- I just- I’ve just been like, staring at it, so it’s all I’ve got right now. 
Austin: Ok. 
Janine: Um, so I think it is like, you know, she uses the various intersections of bone as a like, as a foothold and then you grab the spur on the back there to get a good handle, and just like, haul herself up there and like, probably sits on the little- the little like, back spur-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Janine: I should say. This illustration has like, a little bone spur thing jutting out of the back of the- the leg joint. And I can just so easily imagine Adaire sitting there like a fucking mountain climber taking a lunch break. 
Austin: Right. [laughs]  
Janine: [laughing] Trying to tie this- tying this rope around. Um, yes. 
Austin: Alright. 
Janine: It’s probably hell to do in skirts, but whatever. What are you gonna do?
Austin: Yeah, I’m here for it. Alright. It’s on there. You are good on that. Now what? [laughs] You’ve tie- [Janine laughs] So, you’ve tied a rope around a bone dragon leg. 
Janine: Uh hm. 
Ali: The thing that I like about this plan is-
Austin: Love it. 
Ali: -that [laughs] 
Austin: [makes the chef’s kiss sound] Mwa!
Ali: So, if we get the rope around the rest of the limbs, and it is trying to break apart the hold, it is going- that pressure is going to go on that first leg, right? So, it’s gonna be like a loop, where t either cracks or the rope breaks. But like, the leg is gonna be damaged.
Janine: I mean, there’s a reason I definitely tied these around- around like, sort of joint areas. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: Yeah. Um, so me and Lem are now… taking the long parts of this rope and trying to loop it around? With enough strength to-
Janine: So, there’s like a- there’s like a choice here of like, because it has one leg that’s sort of tethered um- do you like, tie one end to something strong and immovable to pin the dragon in place? Or do you like, try and jerk the leg out from under it, so it falls over? And then you can tie up the other legs?
Ali: Oh. 
Janine: Right? Um-
Ali: Huh. 
Janine: I feel like jerking the leg out from under it so it like, topples, and then-
Ali: Right, cause Hella would be giving-
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: -Lem an opening in that case. 
Austin: Or no. 
Ali: And then it’s like a hopeful-
Austin: Oh, are you- So, I mean, I guess you both have 2 strength, so yeah. Either one of you could try this certainly Or no, wait. Lem only has- plus one strength. 
Jack: Uh, no. I just have 1 strength. 
Austin: Ok. [Ali laughs] This is really hard. I think this has to be more than one person on the rope. No one person can pull this dragon out from under it. Like-
Jack: Right, we’re trying- [overlapped] the easy option-
Austin: Or Hella at full strength maybe could have, but not with poisoned lower strength. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Jack: Yes. 
Janine: Oh, we also had a plus 1 for rope antics, right? Is that already used up on my-?
Austin: It was plus 1 forward. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: That was like, you got-
Jack: I haven’t used mine yet though. 
Ali: Oh, cause we all got one, yeah.
Austin: Uh, yeah. I’ll let- I will let Lem continue to have one. 
Jack: Um, ok. So, do you want to yank it down and then send me in to try and tie up its front legs or something? Or-
Austin: [firmly] No one person can- can yank this thing out. 
Jack: Oh. [laughs] Ok. Right. Sorry. 
Ali: Right.
Janine: Yeah. 
Ali: Can- can we have said that we- cause we spoke about it before about like, having already attached it to a strong thing?
Austin: Sure. I think that is- would be a Defy Danger intelligence of some sort, right? To like-
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: ‘I’ve picked the right one. I’ve picked something strong enough. I figured out the thing. The tree with the roots deep enough. [Jack sighs] The stonework that is made of sturdy enough stuff that will not just shatter’, you know? When it comes times. 
Ali: Ok. Yeah. 
Austin: I’m fine with- I’m fine with like, us getting the intercut shot of that happening as Adaire is clim- is dragon’s dogma-ing around this thing’s leg. 
Jack: Yeah, what’s your intelligence, Hella?
Ali: Zero. [laughs] 
Jack: Ok, I have a 1. 
Ali: Oh. 
Jack: So, I could try and identify a target. But I would also burn my plus 1 forward. 
Austin: It’s true. But this will help. I think if you do this, one person can try to yank the leg out from under it.
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Because that object would be equivalent- would be basically being the other-
Jack: The other person. 
Austin: -the other person, right?
Jack: Right, ok. 
Janine: But is it smarter to use that plus 1 on an intelligence roll hare you have 1 versus on a strength roll where you have 2?
Jack: No, I have strength- I have strength one and intelligence one. 
Janine: Oh, ok. Ok. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: So, nevermind then. It doesn't matter. 
Jack: And I’m not charisma-ing my way out of this situation. [Janine laughs] 
Austin: No, I don’t think so. I don’t think so much. 
Jack: Um, other than with some pattern magic. But this is not- I don’t have any rope pattern magic unfortunately. Ok, I’m gonna roll my INT.
Austin: [quietly] Oh man. Give me the- 2d6+2.
Jack: Uh, yeah. 
Austin: Plus 1. Plus 1.
Jack: I just clicked the plus 1 forward box. Will that do it automatically?
Austin: That will do it automatically. Yep. It should.
Jack: Incredible. Incredible. 
Austin: I’m also gonna make sure- Hey! That’s a 10. 
Ali: 10. 
Janine: [quietly] Nice. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: It totally did it. So, what did you- what did you tie it to?
Jack: A mausoleum.
Austin: Ok. 
Jack: Um, I- I tied it through um- it was like a… it’s like a large tomb. It’s not a full scale building. But-
Austin: Can it be- can it be Morbash’s tomb? They would have built that thing real fuckin’ strong. 
Jack: Damn, I mean- I will say yes, if you promise that you’re not gonna destroy this tomb because like-
Austin: Well, I can’t promise that cause all of this could be destroyed if the next roll is failed. Even Morbash’s tomb. Even if you don’t tie it to Morbash’s tomb.
Jack: Ok, that’s true. Basically- but what I want to ensure- what I am bargaining for here, isn’t that the slack- the rope goes tight and the tomb just-
Austin: Shatters. No, you got a 10 on this, which is why that will not happen. You found-
Jack: Ok. 
Austin: I’m saying you found the strongest tomb, and it happens to be Morbash’s tomb. 
Jack: Yeah, it’s 100% Morbash’s tomb. Lem doesn’t know this in the moment. 
Austin: No. 
Jack: Um, it’s just like, ‘Oh, that one.’
Austin: But the camera does. Alright, nice. Alright. 
Jack: Oh, Morbash’s tomb. Do we know what it looks like?
Austin: No, tell me. 
Jack: I just- I don’t want to miss the opportunity of getting-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -Morbash’s tomb on screen. Um, it is uh, like it’s incredibly solid. That I would say is its defining characteristic. [Ali, Austin, and Jack laugh] But on top of that, it has um, wooden and stone carvings and inlay of just like, everything. I think, in death, Morbash’s grimmest role is still played out-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -which is a- He is surrounded by things that he has gotten. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Um, legitimately or not. [Austin laughs lightly] So, his tomb is built from the carvings of bones of- of his conquests, basically. 
Austin: Yeah, I like it a lot. Um, alright. I guess, is this the moment, Hella, you gotta pull that fuckin’ thing?
Ali: Yeah, I just have to roll strength, huh? That’s it? And then we see if we all succeeded. 
Austin: And we see if we all succeeded. We see if this thing gets pulled- I mean, this will have pulled it out from under it, right? 
Ali: Oh, please don’t fail this. 
Jack: Yeah, we’re not even to the end of ‘get the dragon’ yet.
Austin: No. This is going very well though. 12-10 is not a bad set of rolls. 
Jack: Don’t say that Austin. 
Janine: Yeah, why would you say that?
Austin: Cause it’s a good set of rolls. 
Jack: Hey, why would you say that, Austin?
Austin: Cause it’s good. Y’all doin’ good. 
Janine: You just want us to fail. [Ali exhales] 
Austin: I don’t.
Janine: You just want this dragon to become the new fuckin’ baron of this place.
Austin: That’s it. [Ali and Austin laugh] Uh huh. [using deep voice] “It’s me, Baron Dragon.’
Janine: We needed a name for this place, and now it’s called Dragon Baron. 
Austin: [laughs] Good name honestly.
Ali: Ok, I’m just gonna roll. 
Austin: God, can you imagine if we started the next game- if I started the next game with the other group and they- I opened the world map, and I just erased Last University and had written Dragon Baron there. [Janine laughs] What’s going on in that-?
Jack: If we- if we get a dragon, that might be cause for renaming a place, to be ex-
Austin: Famous last words. [laughs] 
Ali: Ok, I’m rolling. 11. 
Austin: Yo! 11, alright.
Janine: Yay!
Jack: Yes!
Ali: Oh my god. 
Austin: Nice work. What’s this look like?
Ali: I don’t know. I don’t know that I know anymore. I don’t even know that Hella really knows anymore, right? [Two people laugh] Like she’s
Janine: One end of a rope left and Adaire’s like, 
Janine (as Adaire): Pull that fucking rope, Hella. 
Austin: Yep. 
Ali: And she does. And I don’t think she even sees the dragon like, in terms of like, how far she’s bleeding out at this point, right?
Austin: Yep.
Ali: But like, pulls on it. It doesn’t yank back. 
Austin: It doesn’t yank back. 
Ali: She- [laughs] 
Austin: I think we see it go taut, and like, it pulls for a second, like it’s like, ‘uh oh’, but then it does. Morbash’s tomb holds and between the two, it can’t quite, move and you yank it, and it slams into the ground. And it’s- it’s- You’re holding it there. It’s being held on the ground in this moment.
Jack: Oh, Jesus.
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Oh, so now there’s a-
Austin: It’s like snapping in the air.
Jack: It’s scary, right? Like, we have-
Austin: Yeah, dog.
Jack:  We’ve managed to- We have like- we’ve made a terrifying loose thing into a terrifying captured, or semi-captured thing. 
Austin: Semi-captured. 
Jack: But that’s like almost worse. 
Austin: Yeah. Well, no. It’s not almost worse.
Jack: Ok.
Austin: Worse was a big undead dragon, for sure. 
Jack: Walking around. Yeah.
Austin: Yes. 
Janine: You need to get those other fuckin’ legs. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Jack: Ok, let’s go. Is this just a scramble at this point? We’re just like-
Janine: This is probably a fuckin’ scramble. I can’t imagine, even good rolls aside that this dragon is just gonna hang out on its back or side for a while. [laughs]
Austin: This is- This is a- No. No. No. [Jack laughs] No, you have to take care of this right now if you’re gonna get- Yeah. You’re doing extremely well. 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: Here’s what I’m gonna say is like, basically, no matter what happens at this point, that has given y’all an XP, for sure. [Ali laughs] Like, for sure. That whole maneuver. [chef’s kiss foley] Mwah. So good. Love it. Love to paint word pictures. [Janine and Ali laugh] God.
Jack: Oh Jesus. Ok.
Austin: Fuckin’, I can’t believe you- you snowspeeder AT-AT’ed- [Jack laughs] AT-AT tow cabled a dragon in the fuckin’ cemetery, goth boy clique. What’s good? 
Jack: Um, I’m seeing if I have any pattern magic that might help at this point. 
Austin: Good.
Jack: Um, to just like, fuck up the dragon, as we go in.
Austin: Sure. Right, there’s the other thing is like, you could kill this dragon. You could try to kill is still a thing on the table.
Janine: It’s way easier to kill it when it’s immobile though is my- 
Austin: Sure. 
Janine: That’s my number one goal here. [Janine and Jack laugh]
Austin: Uh hm.
Jack: Um, so like, running through the options here. I have Wolf in White Van which makes enemies attack other enemies. 
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: Not super useful right now. 
Austin: No. 
Jack: I have Metal Hurlant which does damage and deafens targets 
Austin: Yeah 
Jack: But it also has a high risk of- of damaging people kind of nearby. 
Austin: It’s if- Yeah, if you get a 7 to- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. Yes. 
Jack: Alternatively, I could try what I was thinking of earlier with Arcane Art, but instead of healing, I could get um- So, a nice thing about Arcane Art is I can make it- when someone- the next time someone successfully assists the target with aid, they get +2 instead of +1.
Austin: That’s nice. 
Jack: That might be useful if I target one of us. Um, that’s kind of my- the menu. 
[1:45:00]
Ali: Hmm.... I-
Austin: I’d say go-
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah, I’d say go with you gut here. What’s- what’s Lem doing in this moment?
Jack: Why I’m just working out like, what is- what’s Adaire’s next move?
Janine: Tie a leg up. Tie another leg-
Jack: Tie a leg?
Janine: Yeah.
Jack: Just go in for the leg?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Tie a leggy.
Jack: Ok. A- [laughs softly] tie a leggy.
Janine: She‘s just gonna keep tying those legs, cause I’ve got DEX 3. I’m gonna keep- I’m gonna use- I’m gonna-
Austin: Yeah, that’s what you got. 
Janine: -ride that into the ground. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Janine: I did not-
Jack: Gotta keep tying those legs until there are no more legs.
Janine: I did not pump my DEX up this high to just be like, ‘Nah, I don’t know. I’m gonna go have a sandwich.’ [Austin laughs] My job is done.’ 
Jack: So, what about if I target um, Adaire with Arcane Art and Hella could possibly assist. Or I could also assist which would- would get us a plus 2, instead of a plus 1. 
Austin: Wouldn’t you be targeting- Oh yeah. Yeah, that would totally work. Yeah. Go ahead and- go ahead and do that. What’s that look like? Do you play and-
Jack: Uh, let me just go over again here the magic reverberates to other targets, affecting them as well. GM’s choice. 
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: Um, hmm. 
Austin: Which I know what that looks like, by the way. Even though-
Jack: Good. 
Austin: Yeah, uh hm.
Jack: Um, I think that this is, you know- this is rally. There is- there is momentum to this performance. And it is- it’s the momentum of like, ‘Alright. Ok. Now’s the- now’s the time.’ You know, if Adaire were to picture the montage sequence of this going as well as it could, this would be what would be playing in the background. 
Austin: Gotcha. Alright, give me the roll. 
Jack: But we’ll see how it goes. 
Austin: 2d6 plus 2 for your charisma. 
Ali: [nervously] Oh.
Austin: Uh hm. That’s an 11. 
Ali: 11!
Janine: Oh my god.
Austin: Look at that! Alright. The music is- The fuckin’ music is rallying. Uh-
Janine: What’s the effect from that?
Jack: Next time someone successfully assists you with aid, they get a plus 2 instead of a plus 1. 
Austin: Or you get a plus 2 instead of a plus one. 
Jack: Oh yeah. The target is they in that sentence yes. 
Austin: Yeah, yeah. 
Ali: Ok. And I guess the assist that I am doing is like-
Austin: Oh yeah. 
Ali: -if- if we have a- like, I have a part of the rope that’s like the most mobile at this point. 


Austin: Uh hm. 
Ali: And if I start to loop it around the other limbs, Adaire can close that circle, right?
Austin: Yes. Totally. Totally. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Um, Adaire? Do you want to make this DEX roll?
Janine: I do. [sighs] Ok. [Ali laughs]
Austin: Uh hm. 
Janine: Uh, oh, I should do- plus 1. 
Austin: Plus 1 from?
Janine: From Hella helping?
Austin: Or no, Hella should roll to help, if that’s-
Janine: Oh, right. Hella, yeah.
Janine: Ok. I should do that first. 
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Ali: I wasn’t sure if you roll and I assist you after. Um-
Austin: Uh, 2d6 plus 1 from you having-
Ali: Ok, that’s gonna-
Janine: That’s a 7. 
Ali: -be an 8.
Austin: Alright. So, this means that you are also exposed to danger, retribution, or cost depending on how this next roll goes, but honestly this is gonna be 2d6 plus 5, so it won’t- I mean, it could still go rough, but it won’t go- It can’t, even on a 1-1, it’s a mixed success, right? Cause 2d6 plus 3, plus another 2 from your aid. So-
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: 2d6 plus 5. 
Ali: God.
Janine: I would have to really fuck this up to- I don’t think it’s possible for me to actually fail that- 
Austin: Oh my god. 
Jack: Woah.
Janine: That’s a 15. 
Austin: That’s a 15. Yeah, there was no way you were gonna actually fully fail, but you rolled a 6 and a 4. 
Janine: I would have had to get two 1’s, it would have been a pass anyway, so it’s-
Austin: Yes, exactly. Um, alright. You loop this thing up, and you’re- you’re tying it down with this rope. It’s- it is- You’re using a lot of rope. This is the thing I am gonna say is, you’re gonna burn through three- three adventuring gears worth of rope. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: Like this is rope that is meant to let you climb a wall, you know?
Janine: Here’s the secret. I- I absolutely know that I used adventuring gear at some point. I did-
Austin: Yes. 
Janine: When we went um- underground, I used rope to- Everyone was floating away, and I tied rope to Kodiak. 
Austin: Yes. Yes. 
Janine: So, the thing is I used adventuring before. I’ve only ever used it for rope, so the idea that Adaire’s adventuring gear is maybe-
Austin: So funny. 
Janine: -just all rope, totally makes sense. 
Austin: Maybe different types of rope, but it’s all rope.
Janine: Yep.
Austin: That’s very good. 
Jack: What else do you need?
Janine: What else do you need?
Austin: Um, perfect. Yeah, it’s tied down in this moment. Um, it is- it is- You have a- you can all take a breath. Like, you don’t know how long this is gonna last. You don’t- You do not know. Like, I cannot- It is not like, ‘Oh, I’m done now. I’m gonna take a nap.’ [Jack laughs] Like, it is still struggling. And here’s the big one, you cannot go near its face. It will bite your head off, right?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, and it’s like, rolling and trying to break free. But you have all of its legs tied up. Also, its tail is- is still writhing and like- So, its head and its tail are both very dangerous still.
Jack: In this moment, could we get a quick look at what the other citizens of the university are doing?
Austin: Yes. There are a number- Corsica’s guards have already begun to- Or so there’s like the city- In my mind, there’s the city guard and there’s the military guard, right? There’s like, Corsica’s military, and then there is like, Hella slash Throndir’s city guard. Um, and the guard has been shooting- or so, in general, what I want to say is, for people not looking at the screen, there are again- there are hundreds of little tents all around the city representing an influx of thousands of refugees over the last couple of weeks. 
Both the city guard and Corsica’s military have been living and like, patrolling among those refugees to make sure that like, fights don’t break out and to make sure people have food. And they’re doing their best to basically be civil servants. But also, people genuinely and generally don’t like to just have cops walking around- [laughs] in- when they’re like- it feels- it has made most of the people who’ve gotten here feel like they’re under surveillance, right? Especially cause they’re like- there is not enough room inside of the walls for a lot of these people, as more permanent structures are being built and more permanent solutions are being figured out. Many of them are just living in tents. Many of them are eating very cheap food. And so, to also have this feeling of like, ‘oh, you’re all under surveillance’ is rough. 
And I think, in this moment, the groups to the northwest and the northeast, which are nearest to you, kind of like north of the Outhouse and Rix and Rowe’s hovel- That group and also the group to the northeast of the cemetery temple and north of the range, those groups are being evacuated in this moment. People are being like, those- the military guard and the city guard are both like, pushing people away and like, ‘hey, there is a- there is danger over here. We have to get you further away.’ 
So, it’s moved a lot of people- Anyone who is inside of the star wall has been moved outside of the star wall and far enough away that like, if this thing breaks through and goes in those directions, those people will be safe. Uh, I think likewise, the people inside of the like, food, shopping, and homes district- the like, outside the wall- second city where the Outhouse- where Fero has rebuilt the Outhouse to be a giant building- [laughs] It’s gigantic. Um, is- those people mostly are moving inwards to the safety of the city wall, right? Or the campus wall.  
[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” begins playing in the background] 
And the other- and then like, the northern half of that campus has now been filled with soldiers. And I think at this point that it’s tied down more soldiers are now finally coming off the wall, down the wall, to come try to help you. So, I’d say probably like, 5 people have shown up so far and more are taken to the wall now. Um, people are scared. This is a very scary thing. There was a- there is a good chance this could break really bad. 
[Music plays out to end]
