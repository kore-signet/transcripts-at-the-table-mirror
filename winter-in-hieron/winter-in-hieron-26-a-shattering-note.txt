Winter In Hieron 26: A Shattering Note


Transcriber: Lu


AUSTIN: Before you see anything at all, Lem, you hear the sound of barking. There's one dog, very close to you, and then another one or two off in the distance. And, as you eyes clear, you first see yourself reflected back in a cracked mirror. And then you see, reflected in that mirror, a big familiar dog. It’s Kodiak. What do you do?


JACK: Uh, I drop to my knees? [awww from AUSTIN] And kinda put my hands out as if to sort of reach for Kodiak, for support? 


AUSTIN: [laughing] You reach for him for support? Okay. Uh… he kinda looks at you and nuzzles briefly? And then looks back at the mirror, and then back at you? 


AUSTIN (as Kodiak): [barking noises]


JACK (as Lem): Oh, Kodiak. [laughs] Oh, you didn't go through, did you? 


AUSTIN (as Kodiak): [sad puppy noises]


JACK: Oh, uh… I'm sure he’s okay. Ephrim’s there I think. And… Fero is there. There-


AUSTIN: He like, puts his head in the mirror and pushes it once or twice?


JACK (as Lem): No, buddy- that's not- uh… believe me, if I- actually hang on.


JACK: And I'm gonna put my hand against the mirror, and push against it.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh! Kodiak barks again, and then falls sideways, into the ground, disappearing. And then the mirror shatters.


JACK: [amused] Lem just leaps up, and shouts. [laughing]


AUSTIN: Uh, there are two more dogs barking in the distance still, when you shout they answer your shout with barking. You realize now you're on like, the bank of a kinda- not a forest, but there are a couple trees around. You are like, here, standing between these trees looking northward. And waaay off in the distance you see a boat, which is where you think the dog barking is coming from. They bark for a little bit more, and… then you realize the boat kinda drifts out of your view, you can't really keep an eye on it? You- you notice the familiar glint of a looking glass? You see maybe ten figures on the boat. And then it kinda disappears. And then a moment later, there is a sound. A “pop!”. And a black smoke tail kinda zips upwards into the sky, and you follow it, and as you follow it you kinda take in… The Buoy. or kinda like, this environment. You take in all of the weird towers, and the weird double tree thing, and the House of First Light, and all the other things that are around you. And then you also notice that the strange white tower of starlight has smashed through the sky here- as if the sky itself is mirrored, and the mirror has broken, and the white towers that you saw above? That are kind of closing in, the heat and the dark? Those have sprouted through here too, in beautiful- like, curves. Beautiful arches, a sort of geometric shape that only the greatest artists could achieve.


AUSTIN: And then that smoke tail pops again, and there is a puff of dense, black soot. It is, without a doubt, a signal, and it hangs there just near this island. Behind you, is a house. What do you do?


JACK: D-Do I recognize the house? Does the house remind me of anything?


AUSTIN: Hm… I don't think so, does it? You haven't heard the stories, you haven't read Uklan Tel’s book


JACK: No… and I think that-


AUSTIN: [overlapping] As far as I know.


JACK: -The part of Lem that could evaluate this stuff critically, is not functioning right now! Umh… and so I think that- wait, sorry, is that just a mirror there, between these trees?


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: Huh.


AUSTIN: Just like leaned up against one of the tree trunks. Like a tall standing mirror, with rusting metal… and some really fine engravings of blossoming trees.


JACK: So I think what the shot is- is of this broken mirror and of the signal in the sky, the explosion. And Lem’s standing there, for a moment? And then just turning and kinda running through the trees, haphazardly, towards the house that he can see?.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh. There's a front door that's been left open- I imagine its a screen door. Like a porch with basically a screen door- and you go inside?


JACK: Yeah, I think I'm gonna go inside and call out?


AUSTIN: You're in- you kinda open up into this living room, where there are kinda… deep maroon couches- which again, kinda have this floral pattern in them- and you hear people talking in the next room over, as you call out. Hey everybody, Lem just called out! You'd been taking a break from hearing the story from Samol, who is now serving you dinner- or, who’s about to serve you dinner- and the last thing that you… y’know, you all went out to do different things, get- put your stuff down, get water, whatever. And Throndir wandered off outside, to take Kodiak for a walk. And now Lem is yelling from the living room! [chuckles] What do yall do?


ALI: Can I get up?


AUSTIN: Yeah! Yeah, no one is keeping you here.


ALI: Yeah, I…


ALI (as Hella:) Lem??


[someone laughs]


ALI: And I like [laughs] charge towards the living room?


ART: Hadrian’s like a little more put out? Like, Hadrian is super into the story, but like- [ALI giggles] stuff’s happening, I'm- yeah, he follows.


AUSTIN: [amused] Uh, Lem is in the living room!


JACK: I think i'm just kinda frozen. And I think that as Hella comes through the door, [stuttering] I don't know how to… begin to express what Lem is saying? I suppose it just doesn't make sense, at first? [laughing] It's just not sentences. 


[AUSTIN laughs]


JACK: It's just not- its not a description of a thing,


JACK (as Lem): there was a mirror, Uklan Tel was there, there were dand- it happened to Sunder and then it happened to me! I've got Throndir- I mean, they've got Throndir!


ALI (as Hella): Wait-


AUSTIN: Um, you're also- we should note that also Lem is a little wet? Head to toe?


JACK: And I don't have any armor on? [ALI chuckles]


AUSTIN: Or your backpack? Uh, you have-


JACK: Or my pack.


AUSTIN: You have your fiddle, which is clearly water damaged, and a couple of the lines on it have broken? A couple of the- the… [pause] What are the words for-


JACK: Strings?


AUSTIN: Strings! Strings. Uh, and-


JACK: [overlapping] Am I just carrying it in one hand, rather than on my pack? 


AUSTIN: -And in the other hand, is the fucking mask of Samot! [ALI laughing] Those are the two things you showed up with!


JACK: Yep!


[pause]


AUSTIN: Good times. 


ALI: [laughing] Oh…


AUSTIN (as Samol): Dinner’s just about ready. 


AUSTIN: You hear Samol from the other room.


JACK (as Lem): [panicked] Is this real?


ALI (as Hella): Maybe? Just-


JACK (as Lem): [more panicked] What? No! Don't- [ALI giggling] Not a good answer!


ALI (as Hella): Just.. I- I heard- you're actually Lem.


JACK (as Lem): Yeah??


ALI (as Hella): Okay, just-


JACK (as Lem): Who else would I be?


ALI (as Hella): I don't- where’s Throndir?


JACK: He's in the- the room! He's in the- he’s in the room with Zhan!


[pause] 


ALI (as Hella): Why don't you sit down… Come on- I-


ART as Hadrian: [overlapping] Did- did you say jam??  


[everyone laughs, loudly]


JACK (as Lem): Zhan. No, I didn't- Hadrian! [laughs]


[INTRO “Inside” STARTS PLAYING]
AUSTIN: Uh… Samol comes into the dining room, with a… a fucking feast, y’all. 
[laughs] It is like sunday dinner time here, right now. There's a bunch of stuff that he’s grown in the garden, he’s got some chicken made up, he’s got some greens- like, its- hieron has southern cooking, it might only exist in this room, but here it is! [JACK chuckles] And its good. Uh.. it smells incredible and- he doesn't fucking bat a lash at you being here, Lem.


AUSTIN (as Samol): Take a seat!


JACK (as Lem): O- Okay. Uh… Hella, is anyone sitting here?


ALI (as Hella): No, no no no. Sit down, please. 


JACK (as Lem): Okay…


JACK: And I'm gonna sit down, but I'm gonna sit still carrying the mask in one hand and the violin in the other? [AUSTIN laughs] Just with my hands by my sides?


ALI (as Hella): Do you want me to… hold on to that stuff for you?


JACK (as Lem): Uh, yeah I’m…. [pained tone] Oh, don't put the mask on…


ALI (as Hella): Uh? [ART laughs] I wasn't gonna- okay!


AUSTIN (as Samol): Alright everybody. Kinda seems like a... strange thing do to do say grace, so I'm just gonna pick up wherever we left off. It's been fifteen years since the forces of the Boy-Traitor Samot were turned away from Marielda by violent ingenuity of the Artificer-Divine Samothes. Thousands died in the final battle of the war, and so, the people of Marielda gathered to rebuild again; except now, with the esoteric machines of the Father Inventor, Marielda regained itself at speed. And with speed, it changed.


[INTRO STOPS PLAYING]


AUSTIN: Welcome to Friends at the Table, an actual play podcast focused on critical worldbuilding, smart characterisation, and fun interaction between good friends. Today we’re continuing our game of Dungeon World, by Adam Koebel and Sage LaTorra, which is a hack of D. Vincent Baker’s Apocalypse World! My agenda is to portray a fantastic world, to fill the characters lives with adventures, and to play to find out what happens. I'm your host and GM Austin Walker, joining me today Jack de Quidt


JACK: Hi! Uh, I'm Jack, you can find me on Twitter @notquitereal or buy any of the music featured on the show at notquitereal.bandcamp.com!


AUSTIN: Janine Hawkins


JANINE: i'm @bleatingheart on Twitter… and I'm also sick this week, so… sorry.


ALI: [laughs] Ow…


AUSTIN: [amused] That laugh was Ali Acampora


ALI: Uh, hi! My name is Alicia Acampora, you can find me on @ALI_west on Twitter and you can follow the show over at @Friends_Table


AUSTIN: And Art Martinez-Tebbel.


ART: Hey, hi!


AUSTIN: I did it, I did it.


ART: [laughs] I wasn't gonna call attention to it, I was just gonna- it felt rude! But you can follow me on Twitter @atebbel


AUSTIN: And I'm, again, AUSTIN Walker, @AUSTIN_walker on Twitter- I realized I didn't throw my twitter, so…. Uh, if you haven't listened to Marielda, which was like our micro-season in- between Counter/Weight and Autumn in Hieron, [amused] now is the time to do that. That is what happens, right now. I guess- technically the first two episodes of that, played before this episode but after the last forest party episode? And now Samol is going to lead in to talk about The Six, and the story of The Six! And all- what happened with Samothes, and Maelgwyn… all of that. So, if you don't know that stuff like… today is the day. Also, speaking of today being the day, there is an announcement- I guess two announcements. One is, I can now announce the post mortem date for this season, ‘cause we- we are wrapping it up! It is going to be-


ALI: June.


AUSTIN: Twenty fourth? And we are going to do it on Twitch, at twitch.tv/friendsathtetable. And, if you want to, you can send us questions that we will answer during the post mortem. You can send those to friendsatthetable@gmail.com, and in general the sorts of questions that we answer range from, y’know, what our favorite scenes from the seasons were, to what the process was, going into some of our preparation or certain sequences or scenes… um, even to y’know “hey, I didn't understand x” and obviously somethings are meant to ba a lil bit unexplained? But other ones I tend to wanna answer straight up, ‘cause I want everyone to be on the same page, so. Again, that's friendsatthetable@gmail.com. And then… also, the other thing I wanna announce is that one of our fans, Jay, @tanoreth on Twitter, is organizing a Marielda Charity Fanzine! Its called City of Light, an unofficial illustrated concordance of Marielda, and its a charity zine that will be raising money for Avenues for Homeless Youth, which is a Minnesota based charity that provides emergency shelter, shortcome housing and supportive services for homeless youth in a safe, nurturing environment. And you can find more info about that either at Marieldazine.tumblr.com on Twitter @Marieldazine. If you don't know how to spell Marielda it- it was the season that I just said you should go listen to, its M-A-R-I-E-L-D-A. Marieldazine.tumblr.com or on Twitter @Marieldazine.


AUSTIN: Alright!


ALI: Do we wanna go over any of that…?


AUSTIN: Yeah, definitely. Uh- let me just set up one other thing and then we’ll pivot back, briefly. Uh, I think Samol gets through dinner and then after cleaning up plates and y’know, dishes and baskets filled with biscuits and all that, he comes back out and says like


AUSTIN (as Samol): We should move back into the living room, I just gotta take care of something first… Everyone hold on to something.


AUSTIN: And he pulls up- there's like a pair of wooden blinds that he opens? And then like, nods briefly to the fact of that boat that Lem saw before, and the signal flare? And then the house shakes for a moment, and you see that the ship is moving further away from you. And then you see that the northern shore- or the blocked path, in The Buoy? Is also moving further away from you. Because you, and this whole island, are moving. Its as if he’d unanchored the island itself, and is now fleeing away from the boat. So that's good, right?


ALI: We’re in it, aren't we?


ART: [overlapping] Sure…


AUSTIN: You're in it.


ART: Are we literally falling? Is that gonna happen?


AUSTIN: No, so you get to the edge, where the fucking… waterfall is? And then there's a shake for a moment? And then… you- it turns, there's a turn. [laughing] Did you watch when GiantBomb did the Kerbal series? Uh…


ART: Yes


ALI: I did not…


AUSTIN: Uh, there's a thing that happens, when you launched into space, you knew that things were okay when the view turns? And you've kinda reached orbit at that point. That happens here [laughs] and there's just like this really disorienting moment, and then- then everything kinda reorients itself. And then yesh- now is when everyone retires to the living room, and gets comfy, and over the next… week? Samol gives you this story. So there's definitely time for all of us to ask questions and try to remember what happened in that, and then also there's going to be time to ask- to literally ask him questions. Uh, Ali do you wanna give us like, the very quick version of what happened?


ALI: [laughs] Sure?


AUSTIN: Or Jack, the people who- you and Jack are the two who were in that game, on this call.


ALI: Right, yeah.


AUSTIN: And me, but like- I talk a lot, so.


ALI: [laughing] Fair… Marielda- oh god, [off-mic meowing] Where do we start with Marielda?


AUSTIN: [excited] Wait no- is that a cat? Was that a cat?


ALI: Yeah, yeah [laughing]


AUSTIN: So you start with a cat- I think we started with a cat!


JACK: Yeah!


AUSTIN: In The Six, right? like , that's-


JACK:[overlapping] There were like five...


ALI: [overlapping] That was the first shot in Marielda, was a cat on a trainyard.


AUSTIN: Of- of- yeah. What is it like-


JACK: [overlapping] There's like five thieves, who- 


AUSTIN: [laughing] What I actually love is that Lem showed up and missed the worldbuilding episodes?


JACK: -are bad [laughs]


AUSTIN: So he’s like “wait wait wait- what is this place? [laughing] Why is there fire surrounding it?? [ALI giggles] What [JACK overlaps] do you mean fish rocks?? Fish rocks??? That doesn't make any sense!”


JACK: [amused, overlapping] That seems frankly impossible.


[pause]


AUSTIN: So yeah what's the- what’s the deal with Marielda?


ALI: [laughing] I… the shortest version of Marielda that I can say is that six thieves… are trying to rob knowledge, to give to people in the town of Marielda. And one day-


AUSTIN: [overlapping] Which was what is now the Town of First Light, where Samot is the king, presumably. At the time Samothes was.


ALI: While he was at war with Samot? Which I guess you just said?


AUSTIN: Yes, yeah.


[ALI laughs]


ART: It’s weird how calling it the town of First Light is like, weirdly diminishing. 


AUSTIN: [amused] Wait did I say town? I meant city.


ART: I know, but its just- its funny.


AUSTIN: I know, yeah


ALI: Uh… they eventually go to a college? And steal… and find the first prince?


AUSTIN: They find… Maelgwyn. They find a gauntlet that has Maelgwyn, who is the child of Samothes and Samot. They also learn about the Heat and the Dark, which is… the thing that came before Hieron, which is just like a void of nothingness that by mistake produced Samol, who is the person feeding you dinner, and who is also the continent of Hieron [laughs]. 


[ALI and JANINE laugh]


AUSTIN: Our fucking world...uh… What else happens? There's a civil war.


JACK: We learn that... we are essentially hired- or they're essentially hired- by a god to try and acquire something? Uh, and the way you acquire it is that Samothes has to die


AUSTIN: Right. There was kind of a- a number of mixed... [struggling] hm. A bunch of different people want a bunch of different things to happen, that results in-


JACK: We can maybe do this as a pickup!


[AUSTIN and ALI laugh]


AUSTIN: No, I like the messiness of it! like this is- this is- I know what happened here but it's hard to briefly say it, which is why if you're listening to us now, struggling to catch you up, you should just go listen to Marielda. That said, if you have questions about Marielda, people on this call that are like, fact questions that you would know after hearing Samol tell the story? You can ask me, and that's not gonna like- that's not even you asking Samol, unless in-character your characters don't understand. Which is different, and you should do that


JACK: So…. Both in character and out of character there's something that I want cleared up, which actually dovetails pretty well with what's something that Lem would want? Which is… during the kinda- the finale of Marielda, the group of mages, masked mages, began to take fairly direct action against the party?


AUSTIN: Correct.


JACK: Claiming to work for Samot. What is the nature of those masks? And how do they work? [pause] Says Lem, holding the mask.


[everyone laughs]


AUSTIN (as Samol): masks like that were built for… [sigh] for folks that Samot trusted. Direct line of communication. And.. well. Those mages realized that that was a particular piece of technology they could use for their own devices. And they used this to intercept the one that… the boy Maelgwyn had. They sent him to do a terrible thing. 


JACK (as Lem): This mask that I have… is it genuine?


AUSTIN (as Samo)l: Let me see. 


AUSTIN: And he reaches his hand out. And you can see when he reaches his hand out, his like- he has like a button up shirt that pulls up on the arm a little- and you can see that his veins are like, popping out a little bit? You can see hes... really thin and the veins are like a deep purply red. But he takes the mask and, like a counterfeit bill, holds it up to the light? And he turns it left and right in his hand?


AUSTIN (as Samol): [tsks] That's the real thing. 


AUSTIN: And he hands it back.


AUSTIN (as Samo)l: that's the one you got from the tower, right? Severia’s?


JACK (as Lem): Yeah. I took it off somebody in the tower, a soldier.


AUSTIN (as Samol): Yeah. That's legitimate.


JACK (as Lem): I've worn it.


AUSTIN (as Samol): A lotta people have. Don't get me wrong, things like that are rare, but… he's a king, he has to talk to a lot of people. Now i'm gonna go have a smoke. If y’all need me I'm gonna be on the porch.


ART: [laughing] Oh, I didn't know he was only gonna take one question…


JACK: [laughs] Oh, but now's the porch questions!


AUSTIN: [overlapping] Oh, he- he is around. Yeah, the next ones are porch questions. I wanna not have this conversation in a boring living room, when we are in this cool underground world! 


JACK: Descending a waterfall like, reverse Zora armor.


AUSTIN: Yeah, exactly! Um… He like goes outside and lights a little fire out- he kinda- I guess he probably has like a little stone…  I don't even know what that would be like- not a campfire, obviously, but- like a little stone stove on the porch? That he lights... and takes a seat. And there are some rocking chairs, some like- there's a nice like… what do you call that? Like a bench that's like a swinging-bench, that's attached to the top of the porch? It's nice, it's a nice place. Uh, does anyone follow him out? Like, what's- what's everybody doing? Oh. y'know- before he goes he also says like


AUSTIN (as Samol): Y'all can leave your things in the bedrooms there.


AUSTIN: And he like, gestures to the southern half of the house, which- which would make sense to you now, when you first came in- forest party- this place did not make much sense? And now you've been it long enough that it just- its not confusing in any way to you anymore. And you each have a bedroom, if you want one.


ALI: [long sigh] So at this point we've heard the whole thing?


AUSTIN: Umh-


ALI: Or is there like a middle part.


AUSTIN: I guess this is like a middle- this is like- I don't know… I feel like- it's a little of A and a little of B? I kinda wanna sketch-


ALI: Okay. Yeah, yeah.


ART: All my big questions are gonna come out after it's all over, so.


ALI: Yeah…


AUSTIN: So a lot of people have-  . 


ALI: I feel like if he's alone I want to get some like, Tristero questions in? [laughing] 


AUSTIN: Sure! I like that, that's a good- this is a good time to do it too.


ALI: Yeah…


AUSTIN: You go outside after him?


ALI: Yeah


AUSTIN: Okay. So as we go further down, the boat- first of all, the boat isn't the only boat- sorry the island isn't the only thing on this river at this point? Like, every now and then a riverboat passes, or a canoe? There are people that take this pass to and from the Buoy, and also just like, through various parts of the kinda underworld- or whatever the- through the strata, right? And you… are literally out there when- you kinda go and pass all of this versions of the world? And its soon after you step out there, while he's smoking a pipe, that you see…. I guess you go from seeing where the one sun is, in- where the buoy was? And suddenly you like, cross into a different space, and a different sun is in a different place where its setting, and suddenly the water turns to glass? And instead of moving smoothly, like flowing, the boats move like snapshots. And in that place you can see, in the distance, the tall towers of Nacre. And with each snapshot? They get unbuilt, bit, by bit, by bit, as you go further and further in time.


[pause]


ALI: [laughing] Okay…


AUSTIN: And he's there, sitting in his rocking chair, smoking his pipe.


ALI: Yeah, I… it's tough to kinda nail down what Hella’s approach would be?


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


ALI: ‘Cause it's gotta be a little reluctant? [laughs]


AUSTIN: Sure!


ALI: [laughing] I think- what's the like, outside of the house- like, it a porch, does it have… it there like a wooden fence kinda thing? Or are there just like-


AUSTIN: There are bannisters out- yeah yeah, there's like bannisters around it. I mean- you get to lean on it, y’know what I mean?


ALI: Yeah, cause I- [laughs] imagine her kind of like, leaning on one kind of across from him but like a little to the side, kind of adjacent to him- like, crossed over arms, and then after waaaaay too long of silence, [laughing] being like 


ALI (as Hella): So you're… a god?


AUSTIN (as Samol): Folks call me one.


ALI (as Hella): Uh, okay… umh… do you- I mean you've been telling us this whole story but do you…[struggling] have you kept up with current events?


AUSTIN (as Samol): [scoffs] oh y’know, there's a- a feeling you get sometimes where part of your back itches. That's what current events is like for me. [ALI chuckles] What causes that, I don't know, but also if I wanna know, I can. You see?


ALI (as Hella): s- okay. Uh, I don't but- I guess that makes sense. 


AUSTIN: He grins.


AUSTIN (as Samol): I keep up.


ALI (as Hella): I just… I think you're the only person who would know this? And I apologize if its a little… [sigh] forward? But, uh… when I [pause] when I met Tristero.


AUSTIN (as Samol): Uh-huh


ALI (as Hella): Do you know why... he wanted me to do that?


AUSTIN (as Samol): [sigh] I mean… imagine his life. Alone in the dark. Not a person to talk to, forever. Frankly, I… the old boy in me, more light than- than not. What do you mean, why you?


ALI (as Hella): [laughs] I… I guess its a silly question. I did it, right? So that's not the important part of it, I know why I did it. It could've been anyone right?


AUSTIN (as Samol): [scoffs] No, not the way you did. [pause] I mean… someone with ordennan steel could have done it. Someone else with-


AUSTIN: And he like nods


AUSTIN (as Samol): -that sword, sure. But you gripped my nephews throat, and closed it. That ain't something that just anybody can do.


ALI (as Hella): [laughs] I- I'm learning that more and more day by day.


AUSTIN (as Samo)l: [sigh]


AUSTIN: He like sighs and kinda gives into the fact that you're gonna stay here until he fucking lays it out, y'know? [ALI laughs]


AUSTIN (as Samol): Wonder Avis. Her name was Wonder Avis. She was a… a mage from the University, in the old days. She was from Nacre, her whole family was. The whole Avis family was… clan of royal advisors. They were friends with the royal family of Nacre, with Tristero himself. And the thing is, Avis Wonder was gone, when Tristero brought up that shroud. And to most folks, when he did that, Nacre just vanished. Disappeared entirely.


AUSTIN: And we can see in the distance the towers of Nacre, undoing themselves.


AUSTIN (as Samol): But for her, well. She’d been to school, y'know? She knew what from what. She was on her way home… and uh, let's just say she and the new king Tristero had differences. She was not thrilled with what he had done. I- I love my kin but… [laughs] there weren't a vote! He didn't say “y’all wanna disappear from Hieron?” that's just a thing he did. So…. she and some others gathered up, the people who disagreed. And they set up west.


AUSTIN: And he like taps on the little bit of floating flesh orbiting his body.


ALI: [pained laughing]


AUSTIN (as Samol): And they found themselves a home… [silence] And that was the last great migration out of Nacre till… all this bullshit.


ALI (as Hella): [sigh]


AUSTIN (as Samol): I don't know. The Avis bloodline was very close to Nacre’s, if you know what I mean.


ALI (as Hella): Uh-huh… um, well...thanks for dinner, it was great. Uh- I should let you get to it


ALI: [laughing] And then Hella like- I think she just like, retreats [keeps laughing]


AUSTIN: As she's like, walking away, he says


AUSTIN (as Samol): Avis… betrayed Nacre. At least by how the nacrens tell it. And then, when she dropped Avis, and just became Wonder, they say she betrayed Ordenna too. I ain't saying it's in your blood, but… something to think about, hm?


ALI: [laughing] Hella just like… uh, god. She does a thing where like- I work at retail services so I've done this a lot, where like after someone BL’s at you, and then you're like “have a good day!” [loud laughter from AUSTIN and ALI] It's just- she's just kinda like, guess I'll not smile, and an okay symbol, and like just goes through the door?


AUSTIN: Uh-huh!


ALI: And then goes into her bedroom and shuts it, and that's the last anyones gonna see of her tonight, probably. 


AUSTIN: [laughs softly] That's really good… fair.


Hadrian: I've got something but if anyone else wants to go they can go. Or he can tell me that its closed for the night…


AUSTIN: No, it’s not.


ART: Uh... Hadrian comes out, he sits down and he's kinda like, looking at his hands a lil bit. And he says


ART (as Hadrian): What happened? To… to the pala-din? Why am I here, why am I not… like Castille? Or rather why is someone like Castille not doing what I do?


AUSTIN (as Samol): I mean…. One, plenty of folks like Castille still. You met that man Tabard, hm? 


ART (as Hadrian): Yeah…


AUSTIN (as Samol): But I know what you mean. History is long, and so is the story i'm telling. Let's just say there was a changing of the guard. And at some point, the word came to mean something a little different.


ART (as Hadrian): Hm…


AUSTIN (as Samol): You ask me again when we’re done, and ill tell ya’.


ART (as Hadrian): Alright. [sigh] Thank you.


AUSTIN (as Samol): [amused] Puff


ART: [laughing] Hadrian like waits a beat for him to say something else, but when it's clear that he's not he just… [AUSTIN laughs] Stands up and goes back in.


AUSTIN: Oh, god… I think at some point he… like finishes his pipe and goes in, and then starts dusting the stuff in the living room? He's very… like, not just clean? But very presentational? Again, he has guest, he wants to make sure it looks nice [laughs]. And… again, he's just like, there. He's just there, lifting up a book and dusting underneath it, and like- making sure the books are in the right alphabetical order, and… straightening a painting that's hanging on the wall, just like that.


JACK: I have a question.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


JACK (as Lem): Uh… we met a woman called Corsica? She has an army, uh… and they're dead. But they're dead in a- they're dead in a different way? I don't know. I don't know how much this means to you. Or to me. Uh… I've seen dead people before, and I've seen ghosts, but there's something going on there that I don't- that I don't understand.


AUSTIN: He pauses for a second, as if he's trying to find a memory? But it isn't- he’s like- like zeroing in whoever the fuck you're talking about.


JACK (as Lem): She rides a horse, its covered in armor…


AUSTIN (as Samol): Yeah, I got it. There's lots of ways to be dead. There ain't nothing to it.


JACK (as Lem): That's the answer? 


AUSTIN (as Samol): I mean, what's the question? You saw Nacre. You saw… the bandits. You've seen ghosts, I told you about ghosts


JACK (as Lem): But I mean wh- [sigh]  There's this guy called Emmanuel. We’re kind of… right.


AUSTIN: Smirk.


JACK (as Lem): He… when he died- I don't know how he died, you don't really talk about that. When he died, he became this thing that he is, right? And when Corsica died, or when the man we met on the road died, they became- they became that, and I don't know- I don't know how- how do you choose?


AUSTIN (as Samol): Let me tell you about a…. So, you know reconfiguration, right?


JACK (as Lem): Yeah? Sounds weird as hell, but- yeah


AUSTIN (as Samol): It is. You know, every time that Samothes, or Samot, or me or Severia or Samantine… any time one of us wanted to bring a new culture into the world, we didn't just snap our fingers and say “ah! Lizard people. Lizard people what know how machines work!” Stuff takes time. We needed to do reconfiguration so that there would be that time, so that the culture could build around it. Nacre’s been around a thousand years, in the way it is! More! It wasn't always ivory towers, and… nice smellin’ bread. Corsica’s got a good head on her shoulders, she knows the right perfumes, but… she don’t know how to treat the skin, not yet. Stuff like that… it takes time.


JACK (as Lem): Okay! [sigh]


AUSTIN (as Samol): Y'know…


AUSTIN: And he swallows.


AUSTIN (as Samol): It is tempting, to snap your fingers and make something happen. And… every now and then [pause] I worry that someone did just that. 


JACK (as Lem): Hm…


AUSTIN (as Samol): I got a lotta family [laughs]. Anyway… you have a good night.


JACK (as Lem): You too. Umh… actually, wait- sorry. This is- this might be disrespectful, I'm sorry…


AUSTIN (as Samol): I'm very old, it’s hard to disrespect me.


JACK (as Lem): You were dusting under book, umh… With a duster.


AUSTIN (as Samol): Uh-huh


JACK (as Lem): Couldn't you just snap your fingers and then the house is clean?


AUSTIN (as Samol): No. what?


JACK (as Lem): Well, you're a god, right?


AUSTIN (as Samol): Boy, I am the land you walk on, and I am the mountains, and I am the sky, and I know them all very well. But the problem with being material is, i- its material. I don't get to make it so there isn't dust!


JACK (as Lem): Yeah… yeah


AUSTIN: And he coughs a little bit


AUSTIN (as Samol): We all got things we can't control. Don't ever let anyone convince you otherwise. Someone tells you they've got all in order? That's a liar. Or a fool, or both.


JACK (as Lem): Thank you for talking. Uh… i'm gonna try and sleep now.


AUSTIN: He nods. Does Adaire have anything or is Adaire like- [laughs]


JANINE: [laughing] I was just typing in chat “I'm feeling very attacked right now”


[everyone laughs]


AUSTIN: Oh… god.


JANINE: I mean, the thing is like- this has, at least from Adaire’s point of view, this has so little to do with her. She like, [laughs] she doesn't really understand a lot of like, the stuff that has led her to be in this situation where the earth is making her dinner?


AUSTIN: Uh-huh. Fair.


JANINE: It's mostly just like “okay I signed up for this job, and now I'm here, and now we've been on this island for like some days? And I don't know that I wanna be on this island for some days? [laughing] But I don't really have a choice, so...”


AUSTIN: What are…


JANINE: It's like, probably a little bit alarming but Adaire doesn't like- does not react in a way that would be alarmed, I guess


AUSTIN: Where are you, in the house? Do you like, stay in the public spaces during all of this, or are you just like-?


JANINE: I think- I think a thing she is often doing is like, when there's a moment to do a thing, like right now, she probably goes outside and just walks the perimeter of the island. Like “Yes, this is all still… a floating thing, I can't do anything here, okay. [laughing] I'm still stuck in this weird situation, I guess i'll go listen to the other story”


AUSTIN: The- the water turns back to water by the time you're out there, like- to kinda get through this threshold space where everything is kinda glassy and weird. And, uh… the world around you at this point is- it's like you're going through… a canal, almost? Instead of a river? And you're basically in Velas, it's like the velasian style, right? Except, what if Velas was Venice? And also as big as like… Rosemerrow, plus Velas, plus the City of First Light, plus the New Archives- it's like the whole northwest is a huge thing- one huge velasian mega-city. And you're just one of many ships passing through its wide canal. Uh… and in taking that in, and the lights, and the words down here- the people down here, suddenly Samol is there with you. And if you don't ask him a question, he will ask you one. Which is


AUSTIN (as Samol): Tell me about your family, Adaire.


JANINE (as Adaire): Uh…. I was just gonna say this place started looking shittier… [AUSTIN laughs]


AUSTIN (as Samo)l: This place is alright.


JANINE (as Adaire): I- no it’s not… Velas is a shithole.


AUSTIN (as Samol): There's lots of shitholes, it’s- it’s one of many.


JANINE (as Adaire): Yes, but- [laughs] exactly. It’s chief among shitholes, I don't- what do you wanna know?


AUSTIN (as Samol): I just wanna hear you tell a story! How were your folks like? They do an alright job?


JANINE (as Adaire): [laughing] No!


AUSTIN (as Samol): I don't know, [JANINE overlaps] you- in this-


JANINE (as Adaire): [overlapping] If they’d done an alright job, I don't think I would be on this weird island, underground. [laughs]


AUSTIN (as Samol): Oh, you think they would’ve done a better job if they’d raised you to stay in that shithole. That's what good parenting looks like?


JANINE (as Adaire): Uh… look there's- it’s like you said, there's a lot of shitholes. I- I don't know… they did what they could, but I don't think that was enough, it isn't good enough. 


AUSTIN (as Samol): What would’ve you done different?


JANINE (as Adaire): I mean, I did what I did different. I left.


AUSTIN (as Samol): No, I mean if you were them.


JANINE (as Adaire): [pause] I probably wouldn’t have gotten into that situation in the first place.


AUSTIN: He smiles, and like. Shakes his head


AUSTIN (as Samol): Life is winding up in places you did not intend to wind up in


JANINE (as Adaire): They shouldn't have had so many of us, then. Or they should’ve covered their tracks better. Or, they should’ve paid off the neighbors. Or… any number of things.


AUSTIN (as Samol): But you got out, so. Good on you. I hope you find some place you don't think is a shithole one day, even if it is one. Speaking on that…


AUSTIN: And then he starts to walk away. Uh… and then you see a light in the distance, on… you can't quite see the ship, but you can see a light, it's a torch. It might be a number of torches? But it's getting closer, and glowing more brightly. What do you do?


JANINE: Uh… is it like big?


AUSTIN: Its- its really hard for you to focus in on it with just natural sight. The lights are like, dancing in the distance, a little bit. Like- you can't quite keep your eyes on the lights themselves, and you can't see the boat at all.


JANINE: Uh… I don't know that Adaire does anything.


AUSTIN: Okay


JANINE: Like that's kind of where she's at right now,is just like- this is all just happening anyway, what am I gonna do? Run inside from the lights? Like-


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


JANINE: This is all just happening.


AUSTIN: That's fair. Okay, as everyone- or, do you go back inside eventually? Presumably?


JANINE: Yeah, yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah, okay. Umh… as everyone has settled in for the night, there is a loud crash coming from the… the front of the house. There's like a loud noise of something falling, and then another one. Does anybody have- I guess, does anybody have a move that like, is about them not getting surprised or anything like that?


JANINE: That's literally- yes.


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: Okay. That's good.


JANINE: [laughs] I have a move that's literally “you're never caught by surprise”, so…


AUSTIN: Okay. You're up- then what you hear is… the noise of wood being chopped. Not- and it's not one person, that's the thing that makes Adaire stand on- like, its not Samol is cutting down some wood? Its like multiple people are cutting down some wood, and they're doing it quickly. And then the first tree falls, what do you do? I'm gonna give you this moment when only the first tree has fallen, everyone else will kinda wake up at that second tree falling.


JANINE: Uh… this place fucking sucks… uhm. I probably like go to the- knock on the masters bedroom door or something? Like-


AUSTIN: Uh… as you- yeah, so you knock on that door, and there's- nothing happens


JANINE: [quietly] Oh, fuck… it sucks cause, if it's just some sort of normal weird god bullshit, it's like “okay you woke us up for nothing, thanks” or…. Hm.


AUSTIN: Oh- you're Adaire. Something is wrong. Like- [ALII laughing] I would not have activated that-


JANINE: I’m going to Hella. I go to Hella. Go to Hella.


AUSTIN: [amused] Okay.


JANINE: I’m going to Hella. [laughs]


AUSTIN:  Huh.


ALI: [laughing] Hella is like- you didn't knock on the door, and she is like opening it? As you- [laughs] 


[JANINE chuckles]


AUSTIN: Yeah…


ALI (as Hella): I- do you know what's going on? What's up?


JANINE (as Adaire): [laughing] I have no fucking idea what's going on… for a week now, I've had no idea what's going on.


ALI (as Hella): Yeah, right. Okay, stay behind me. 


ALI: And I like approach where the sound is coming from?


AUSTIN: Oh, it's coming from outside, its coming from outside the front door.


ALI: Outside the front door, okay. I get in front of Adaire, [laughs] and I open the front door?


AUSTIN: Alright! So- give me one second here… the trees outside have been knocked over and set on fire.


JACK: Oh, jeez!


AUSTIN: And…. As you open the door, you reveal two figures. [pause] Sorry I need to move things around real quick. Uh… okay. Let's bring all this into the map layer! Boom!


ALI: Oh, my-


JACK: Holy shit…


AUSTIN: Okay. So, there's fire from this trees that have been knocked over and set ablaze by a group of eight anchor. Three to the north, three to the south and then a couple who are- [amused] who are literally on the porch as you open the door! [laughing] And they're like, as stunned as you are, for a second? Umh… what do you do?


JANINE: Is there a ghost dog? What is that?


AUSTIN: Y- We’ll find out, won't we?


JANINE: Oh, god...


JACK: Wait, wheres is the ghost dog..? Oh my god, yeah!


JANINE: It’s behind the- yeah! [ART overlaps] I thought it was like weird tail...


ART: [overlapping] Well Forest Whitaker was looking for a movie to be in.


[JACK and JANINE laugh]


ALI: Um, there are two of them in front of me?


AUSTIN: There are two of them literally right in front of you, yes.


ALI: I… probably don't have any of my stuff


AUSTIN: Yeah, you kinda just ran out here, huh?


ALI: [mumbling, unintelligible]


JANINE: [overlapping] Oh my god...


ALI: -honest, and say that I don't have any of my stuff-


AUSTIN: I appreciate your honesty!


ALI: I- so I see the two of them, what's behind them?


AUSTIN: Uh… you see two- there are two humanoid figures? And there's a little dog, a little white dog with them. And one of the two humanoid figures is drawing a bow and pointing it at you


ALI: Okay, umh…


AUSTIN: Or pointing at the door, not at you, but at the door. Through the fire


ALI: ‘Cause I was- I was gonna… kind of like, elbow them out of the way?


AUSTIN: Hm…


ALI: And then walk to the edge of the porch, and be like “hey what's the meaning of this?”, ‘cause I think that I'm a cool strong person- I bet that I'm not. So [laughs]


AUSTIN: [amused] Okay so your goal is just to get past them.


ALI: [laughing] Yeah…


AUSTIN: That sounds like a Defy Danger, strength to me?


ALI: [pained] Okay…


AUSTIN: You're just trying to get past them really quick. 


ALI: Yeah. To interact with these people, defenseless.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


ALI: And that's a nine…


AUSTIN: That is a nine. That is a nine, umh… you're able to do it, but they're gonna- you can get past them? But it means having one of them hurt you on the way past. Like, as you move past them, one of them… you don't have anything on you, right? You don't have like, any of your equipment or anything?


ALI: Yeah, but I also literally haven't taken an HP hit this entire season, so [laughs]


AUSTIN: Well, guess what? You're gonna take-


JANINE: Also- can I roll to aid her, to maybe get her to ten?


AUSTIN: Yeah! You can totally. How are you aiding?


JANINE: Uh- okay, so she's…. She's- sorry, explain like, what you're trying to do? [laughs]


ALI: [laughing] I think she's like, kinda trying to side-swipe them? But also nudge them to the side, y'know?


JANINE: I think in that case the best thing Adaire could do to try and aid is like, do something that would startle them and get them to not pay attention for a second, while Hella is like shoving them or whatever?


ALI: [amused] I appreciate it, but I think you should be closing that door like I told you to…


[JANINE chuckles] 


ALI: [laughing] but it's up to you!


JANINE: I mean, I should maybe get the others…[laughing] ‘cause it seems like a situation made- maybe need other people for…


AUSTIN: Yeah. Umh.. alright, so. As you try to move past them, one of them- you elbow the one on the way, you elbow the other one on the way, and then that second one turns and does a slash at your back with a handaxe. And you take two damage.


JANINE: Is Hella wearing her armor?


ALI: No...


AUSTIN: No, she just woke up.


JANINE: Uh, okay. Right, that's fair…


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


ALI: I left my plate inside…


AUSTIN: Right- [amused] it also takes a while to put on plate armor, like it ain't just a thing-


ALI: No, I mean my like, thing that can control them…


AUSTIN: Ohhh, that plate. Yeah, you did, huh?


ALI: Uh-huh…


AUSTIN: [murmuring] -switch to this fire. I'm switching fires, I don't like the fires that I have here.


ALI: [laughing] Okay. Jeez, he’s just making the fire bigger, everyone-


AUSTIN: [overlapping] I'm not- its-


JACK: Yeah.


[everyone overlapping]


ALI: [laughing] He's choosing the fire that he's just also-


JACK: Also its so much- [unintelligible]


ART: [overlapping] From a medium sized circle to a very big line [laughs]


[AUSTIN mumbling in the background]


JACK: Yeah, Austin switched from a fireball to a wall of fire? Which is not an improvement!


JANINE: Wow…


AUSTIN: Well the ball of fire- the ball of fire had a weird white outline, this one has like a nice white-red outline, which is a little easier for you to ignore...


JANINE: You mean pink?


AUSTIN: Uh- sure.


[JANINE laughs]


AUSTIN: I was zoomed out all the way, I couldn’t really see… uh- So what do you do at the edge of this thing?


ALI: I was gonna call out to the people and be like “what are you doing here?”


AUSTIN: Uh- do you have anything that would identify you?


ALI: I… I might have like a necklace, right?


AUSTIN: Yeah, its- its dark though…


ALI: Yeah? [laughs]


AUSTIN: One of them calls out and says that-


ALI: [overlapping] Can I tell them what my name is?


AUSTIN: Uh- sure.


ALI: ‘Cause I know they're ordennan, right?


AUSTIN: Yeah, what do you say? What do you do? I mean they have anchor, right? Like they have- these are metallic- these are metallic anchor, you recognize the design as being- well, we kinda established before, the anchor are made from a bunch of different houses, a bunch of different trade houses in Ordena- this ones are really like, round and bulbous? And are… kind of like, the favorite of- the last time you saw them was with Tavira Shal, and Stornras Glasseye would have inherited her anchor.


ALI: Right. But I know there's a bunch of them around, so like anyways-


AUSTIN: [overlapping] Yes


ALI: -Right?


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah. But this specific design you recognize as being like the ones you fought in… Rosemerrow-


ALI: Ohhhh okay


AUSTIN: Not in Rosemerrow, but in- there were a group of this with Tavira Shal when you met her in Twinbrook. 


ALI: Okay. So they're that familiar. So i'm really rolling the dice here, but. Uh, the last interaction I had with some of those people was fine so, um, yeah. So I step to the edge and I identify myself. I think she just calls out, like


ALI (as Hella): My name is Hella. I'm Hella the queenkiller, of Ordenna, what are you doing?


AUSTIN: Give me a Defy Danger, charisma


ALI: Cool… I have good-


AUSTIN: The- the danger is this guy shooting you with an arrow.


ALI: Yeah, yes it is. [AUSTIN snorts] that's a seven.


AUSTIN: Oh, that's a seven. He says…


AUSTIN (as man): Come- let one of my anchor bring you to me and we can talk.


ALI (as Hella): I'll just… walk over there, but okay...


AUSTIN (as man): no. 


AUSTIN: And one of the- he like shouts the order for the anchor to arrest you. And you can come closer- he will not shoot you, if you accept being shackled and brought over to him.


ALI: [laughing] Sure.


AUSTIN: They bring you over to him, and his dog, and the other guy who has- who has hatchets, to other little hatchets… and then the other anchor is just like banging on the door with his sword- or, his hatchet? And like. Can't break down this wood. And you note the fire I also not quite jumping into the wood the way you would’ve expected it to. Everybody else inside. Adaire, what are you doing?


JANINE: Uh… shouting a lot probably? To… I mean-


ART: What are you saying?


JANINE: [laughing] Fucking… get up, get your shit on!


ART: Well putting on armor takes a long time, so it's probably running out with weapons and nothing.


JANINE: Well put on- put on a core piece or something and just go! And then maybe also stopping on Hellas bedroom to get the- the plate.


AUSTIN: Oh, yeah. Okay


JANINE: That seems like a smart thing to do, maybe? Even though I can't do anything with it, but… [AUSTIN overlaps] what's one supposed to do-


AUSTIN: I mean, you could! you're allowed to use that sword


JANINE: Wait, did she not have her sword either?


ALI: No!


AUSTIN: No, she doesn't have anything.


JANINE: Ohhh! I should definitely also get the evil sword then!


AUSTIN: Okay… everyone, as you're getting up you notice you have no idea where Samol is, and you can see the fire from all the windows. [laughs] Hella. You can now make out these two people, they both wear- one of them is just an ordennan scout, like from the military arm? From the- the Impetus? And the other one has the badge of a Justicier Ajudent? Which is like, the position that Stornras used to have before he became a proper Justicier Capitan. Uh- and so this is like, the one with the axes is the one who is just like an ordennan soldier, and ordennan scout from the army? And the other one is the one who is affiliated with the Justicier. And he's the one with the bow. 


AUSTIN (as soldier): What are you doing here?


ALI (as Hella): I'm on the same mission that i've been on since I left Velas. Its-


AUSTIN (as soldier): And that led you… here.


ALI (as Hella): Yes. 


AUSTIN (as soldier): [sigh] The Living Blood of Fire and the Living Blood of Steel have reason to believe that the corruption originates here, deep underground. Maybe even from this house.


ALI (as Hella): How- did you guys come in through the tower? Or the building that was supposed to be a tower?


AUSTIN (as soldier): We came in through the tower.


ALI (as Hella): [laughs] Since I've gone through that door, I haven't seen any talk, or evidence, or anything of the curse.


AUSTIN (as soldier): We've seen otherwise.


ALI: [quietly] Oh, fuck.


AUSTIN: The dog is like, growling at you a little bit.


AUSTIN (as soldier): In fact, our dog seems to think that maybe the curse is right here


[pause]


AUSTIN: Sorry- let me redo that. Uh… what's a good ghost dog name? Umh...hm. It's not really a ghost dog, its not, it's just a white dog that kinda blurs a little bit at the edges [ALI laughs quietly]


ALI: Wait- [ART overlaps] so its a real, actual dog.


ART: [overlapping] Y’know I've never met one of those, to really know what you would call that?


AUSTIN: Yeah, I guess you would kinda need to have a dog like that to know… I think this dog's name is Barbelo? And so he says


AUSTIN (as soldier): Barbelo here seems to think the curse is right in front of us...


ALI: Wait, is the dog actually a ghost or is it like-


AUSTIN: No, it's a dog, its a white dog. [ALI laughs] But it does have a- it does produce light! It is like a white bright weird dog.


ALI: Okay. Uh…


JACK: But not ghost weird. Just weird.


AUSTIN: [amused] Not ghost weird, just regular weird.


ALI: [whispering] Where’s my… kitty… come back here…


AUSTIN: [chuckles] Everyone else inside, there's a guy with an axe hitting the door… over and over and over again?


ART: Yeah I think I'm trying to get my sword, and grab as much of Hella’s stuff as I can and get out there.


AUSTIN: Okay, you open the door and there's a pala-din, there's an anchor with an axe just swinging it back, you step back and just barely- y’know, it misses you but there- it's right there, blocking the doorway..


ART: Um... how did I do that thing once?


[pause]


AUSTIN: [amused] Good question, what? 


[ALI and JANINE laugh]


ART: I was able to like, make one stop in the woods…


JACK: Oh, yeah!


ALI: Oh, just with your arm!


ART: Yeah, I was able to like, control it, I was able to extend…


AUSTIN: Was that season one or was that this season?


ALI, JANINE & ART: [simultaneously] It was this season.


ART: -it was on Old Man’s Chin.


AUSTIN: Did you do- did you use an ability for that?


ART: No, I think it was some manner of Defy Danger, just because I was trying to do what Tabard did.


AUSTIN: Right, correct, correct. Yes, and the thing to remember though was, that you succeeding in the thing you did was like, make it move its arm a little bit? You weren't doing full commands but, this could be an extension of that.


ART: I mean I don't need the full command, I really just need it to… move back a foot.


AUSTIN: Yeah. [JACK overlaps] go ahead and-


JACK: [overlapping] Also, didn't Hadrian get it to work on the dam? I may be making that up


AUSTIN: Yeah…


ALI: No- but I think he- he like- Jack is right, he cornered one in the woods by itself, and then made it go work on the dam before he even did that agreement.


AUSTIN: Hm… okay! So yeah, I'll stick to that. It's been months since we did that, I just don't remember what- where my headspace was with that? So. [ALI laughs] But ill- ill stick to it. So yeah, go ahead and give me a Defy Danger, charisma. 


ART: Um… alright. And what I'm trying to do is I'm like, focusing and tryna make it like- just like move, move out of the way. And… there's my dice.


AUSTIN: There's a… there's a nine.


ART: -there's a nine...


AUSTIN: That ain't bad. Uh… it- it moves backwards a step, but it still blocks the stairs off of this porch? So you can move out onto this porch, fine. But it's like, not stepping back further than that, and it still has its axe up, like it isn't- it hasn't ceded you the ability to get closer, to get to Hella? But you can all make your way out into the porch now


ART: Okay, I go onto the porch…


AUSTIN: [laughs] And the fire lights this group. There are 8 total anchor, plus the white dog- Barbelo- plus the ordennan scout and the ordennan justicier ajudent . 


JACK: Can I maybe try and find a weapon somewhere in the house, very quickly? I’d be prepared to roll for it... 


AUSTIN: Yeah, what are you- [JACK overlaps] what are you doing?


JACK: [overlapping] ‘Cause I don't have one….


AUSTIN: Tell me what that mens to look like, describe what that looks like


JACK: So I think when Lem realizes that Samol doesn't seem to be around, and also there's fire visible through the windows? And also the anchor? Which- have I seen any anchor? Did I see any in Rosemerrow?


AUSTIN: Yes, absolutely.


JACK: Oh, at the- at the ordennan-


AUSTIN: [overlapping] At the gala, at the- well and at the… New Old Museum.


JACK: Oh, yeah! Totally.


AUSTIN: You saw Ephrim fight a bunch like- yeah, you've seen these.


JACK: Umm. I'm gonna go running into the dinning room, and the kitchen, and possibly the study to just look for something that vaguely approximates my weapon? Which would be a long, big blade or blunt object?


AUSTIN: Right. Yeah, totally, give me…. I think its just fine for you to find this thing. You find a pair of swords, above the fireplace in the living room.


JACK: [laughs] Okay…


AUSTIN: They are not your type of weapon at all? They are very clearly- like rapiers, they are finesse weapons?


JACK: Well, what tag do they have?


AUSTIN: What what do they have? Oh, they have… they probably have the thing rapiers have…


JANINE: I think that is finesse…


AUSTIN: It is, its close-precise, which means you use dexterity, you don't use-


JACK: [laughing] Oh my god, my worst- my worst stat [JANINE laughs] Its okay! One might consider them to be cursed weapons, that's fine [laughs]


AUSTIN: Ohhh, they've been through a lot. 


JACK: Yeah, so I'm gonna take both of these, I think?


AUSTIN: Okay. Close, precise, one weight each.


JACK: Okay


AUSTIN: Wait- they're dueling rapiers, which means close, one piercing, precise, two weight. That means that-


JACK: So four weight


AUSTIN: Yeah, four weight. They go through armor.


JACK: Okay. I got them. So I'm gonna run out onto the porch as well?


AUSTIN: Okay. Lem just showed up with two fucking rapiers [laughs]


JACK: And a violin.


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: And a violin, that has not been restrung! And is probably watered-


ALI: [tsks] He's had time...


AUSTIN: It's probably been watered- wait where did he get the strings?


ALI: There are- Samol has like, guitar strings?


JACK: [AUSTIN overlaps] I don't think that would work!


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: [overlapping] I- I wanna see that scene before- yeah, I would need to-


JANINE: [overlapping] Those are completely different.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


ALI: [laughing] It's just- they're just- its fine…


AUSTIN: [uncertain] Hmmm.


JANINE: [laughing] Oh my god…


ALI: It's just a pattern… Like-


JACK: It’s just- yeah!


AUSTIN: Oh, that's all! Yeah! Uh-huh!


JACK: [laughing] Just put them on, it will be fine!


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


JACK: Wow, Lem’s music sounds terrible! [AUSTIN laughs]


AUSTIN: And Adaire, did you come back out too?


JANINE: Uh… [uncertain] yeah….


AUSTIN: [laughing] Do you just have your arms filled with Hella’s stuff?


JANINE: [chuckles] I probably went for the- the command plate and the sword.


ALI: Okay.


AUSTIN: Hella is like, thirty feet away from you-


JANINE: Very far away.


AUSTIN: -in shackles, so.


JANINE: Yeah…


AUSTIN: That's good. I think there are eight of these anchor.


JANINE: I don't know, what if I stab this anchor with Hella’s rad sword?


AUSTIN: Okay.


JANINE: Is that-


AUSTIN: That's a pretty dope scene! Like-


ALI: Yeah! [laughs]


JANINE: [laughing] This is all a- this is all a fucking nightmare anyways, so let's just-


AUSTIN: [laughing] Adaire’s just like fuck it. Good!


JANINE: Yeah… this is-


JACK: [overlapping] The one on the porch?


AUSTIN: Yeah!


JANINE: -I have to get to her, so!


AUSTIN: [laughing] Fucking- give me a Hack and Slash- what's your bonds? Can we go over bonds?? What's your bond with Hella


ALI: Yeah, we didn't go over any of the things.


AUSTIN: We didn't… we didn't, we should- let's take a moment, before you- we pause, as this blade is going towards this anchor!


[JANINE and ALI laugh]


AUSTIN: Um… Adaire, what are your bonds?


JANINE: My bonds are…”Church or not, Hadrian has more use than most of his sort”. Uh… “Throndir knows some things I can benefit from” which is not super useful right now-


AUSTIN: Nope.


JANINE: And “Hella’s loyalty is a tremendous and unreliable asset, cultivate it actively”


AUSTIN: [laughing] Yeah! That adds up! Let's just go over bonds, as everyone makes a move in this scene, so. Go ahead and give me a hack and slash, as you try to stab that robot with that sword.


JANINE: That's strength, right?


AUSTIN: It’s- yeah, it’s Hack and Slash, strength, correct. [pause] hey! That's an eight!


JANINE: Okay!


AUSTIN: Wow- Y’know what we haven’t done in a long-ass time? It’s Hack and Slash! [everyone laughs] “On a 7-9, you deal your damage, but the enemy is also able to make an attack against you” 


JANINE: Fair


AUSTIN: Ummm… that's fine. You're just gonna trade damage here. So you will be dealing- Hella, does your sword give like a bonus to damage? What’s your sword do?


ALI: Umm, so-


AUSTIN: [amused] I know what- let me be clear. I know what your sword does


ALI: Mh-hm?


AUSTIN: So it plus two piercing, so it goes through two armor by itself. Which is good. So give me your damage roll, Adaire.


JANINE: Uh…. [amused] So, I don't attack much?


AUSTIN: Yeah, so there's a- there's a roll at the top of your-


JANINE: Alright, okay.


AUSTIN: [overlapping] It says damage, yeah.


JANINE: Gotcha…[pause] it has literally been a very long time since Adaire fought.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


ALI: Is that low for you?


AUSTIN: That's low…


JANINE: Um… that's low for me, yeah [laughs]


ALI: Do you wanna reroll it?


AUSTIN: Is that a thing you can do??


ALI: I- that's a- [laughing] so, remember when I told you about that move, that I just get as a human that I literally never had the opportunity- well, i've had opportunities, I just haven't used it…


AUSTIN: Uh-huh?


ALI: But, just because I'm a human fighter, literally the first- the first session of this game… “Once per battle you may reroll a single damage roll, mine or someone else’s”. And I feel like, narratively…


AUSTIN: Yeah…


ALI: This one works.


JANINE: Yeah, that kinda makes sense.


AUSTIN: Totally.


JANINE: Like, I'm using your thing.


ALI: Yeah!


AUSTIN: So go ahead and give me another damage roll.


JANINE: Oh, this better not be a one, wouldn't that suck?


ALI: I like, pray to god that it's not a one or a three.


ALI, AUSTIN & JANINE: [simultaneously] Hey!!


AUSTIN: That's a seven! Went from a two to a seven!.


JANINE: Nice.


AUSTIN: Alright, so, uh…. So you- I mean, its gonna hit you also for… one damage! That's not so bad!


JANINE: That's totally fine! Would I be wearing my armor? Cause its like, leather.


AUSTIN: [uncertain] Uh… I don't think so, you're-


JANINE: It's like a vest…


AUSTIN: You have that thing that no one gets the drop on you, so I'm gonna give it to you, but that's…. That's- yeah. That's the only reason.


JANINE: That's maybe- okay, sure. [laughing] I was gonna say that's very charitable.


AUSTIN: It's pretty charitable… uh- but I want that move- that's a move that you don't get to use that often, so. Alright, so, you do seven damage and this thing…[laughs] the blade goes through it, and you see that the engine at its heart starts to glow? And then you see the blade starts to glow? And then the engine stops glowing, and the body of the anchor just crumbles into metal at the ground. At that moment, the guy with the bow pushes you down into the ground, Hella? And releases a shot across the bow at Adaire. What's everyone on the porch do?


JANINE: [softly] Fuck…


ALI: [shocked] Wh- come on! Hey. [laughs]


AUSTIN: You're shackled, dawg…


ALI: I have legs!


AUSTIN: Okay. This guys gets to go, you can do stuff in a second.


ALI: B- I would like to interfere while he's doing that though?


AUSTIN: Okay. Uh- you can aid whatever Adaire does. Or whatever anyone else on the porch does


JANINE: Yeah, I was gonna say, do I get to go? Or does someone else-


AUSTIN: Yeah, you can- you can counter, [ALI overlaps] you can try to get out of the way or something.


ALI: [overlapping] Also, the- I- I thought the camera was gonna go back to me and the sassy thing that Hella says is “anything they can smell on me is the blood of their queen” so thank you…


AUSTIN: Good. Good.


ALI: [laughs] Anyway. Adaire is gonna get shot.


[JANINE laughs]


AUSTIN: Uh… y’know! You don't stab an anchor without there being repercussions.


ALI: Yep, fair.


JANINE: That's fair.


AUSTIN: so, how do you get out of the way? Or, do you get out of the way…?


JANINE: I would attempt to get out of the way! [laughs]


AUSTIN: Paint me that picture.


JANINE: Ducking… diving, like-


AUSTIN: Okay.


JANINE: That seems like a thing- another thing I haven’t had the chance to do in a while, that is a good choice right now. Diving the fuck out of the way!


AUSTIN: Teah. Let's say Defy Danger… dex, yeah, for sure.


JANINE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: And then Hella, how are you aiding?


ALI: Um… so he pushes me down?


AUSTIN: Mh-hm


ALI: Like, onto my back?


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


ALI: Okay, so what i-


AUSTIN: No- sorry, just to your knees. He like kneels- he pushes down with his forward hand? That's also holding the bow? And like, is stabilizing using your shoulder. Y’know what I mean?


ALI: Okay.


AUSTIN: It's like that Fury Road thing with the rifle, except- he's using your shoulder with a bow instead.


ALI: Can I try to headbut his knees? Like-


AUSTIN: Oh, definitely! 


ALI: Yeah…


AUSTIN: Give me a… an Aid or Interfere. I would raise this from a nine to a ten, so..


ALI: Sure-


JANINE: That’d be nice, yeah.


ALI: I have bonds with Adaire, [amused] which is gonna give me a plus one, do you want me to-


AUSTIN: What are your bonds! Tell me your bonds, tell me all your bonds.


ALI: Yeah! Hi. okay, so...finish with Adaire’s, but…


AUSTIN: Okay.


ALI: [laughs] My bonds are “I know Hadrian wants to see the best of me, but these days I can't afford not to defend myself”? “I am no bright-eyed adventurer, and neither is Throndir. I am not going out of my way to protect him” which is very convenient.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh!


ALI: [laughs] And then I also have a bond that is “The more I see of the world, I wish I could see it through Lem’s eyes” [JACK laughs]


AUSTIN: Aw… [pained noises]


ALI: Yeah… hi Lem.


AUSTIN: That meant something different like three weeks ago [laughs] than it does today!


JACK: Uh-huh.


ALI: Yeah… and then Adaire’s is “If I can learn anything from Adaire, it’s patience. I'd like to teach her to stop meddling”


AUSTIN: Sure.


ALI: And then roll… that's just a 2d6 plus one right?


AUSTIN: Uh-huh [ALI gasps] That's a six, so you don't help in fact.


ALI: Oh my god… I didn't


AUSTIN: In fact, you are the person that causes the thing to happen! You move his arrow? And, Adaire yeah, you totally miss. Uh… Lem gets hit instead.


JACK: Oh, wow!


AUSTIN: Adaire, you're able to get out of the way but… but boy.


ALI: [pained noises]


JACK: What should I roll?


AUSTIN: Ah- You're just gonna get hit, you're gonna take damage is the thing that happens.


JACK: Oh, okay.


AUSTIN: [laughs] Sorry.


[JANINE laughs]


ALI: [pained noises continue] Mean….


AUSTIN: Hey! You take one damage, that's not so bad.


JACK: That's down to six...


AUSTIN: Oh, you're at six, you're at six HP! You're at six HP?


JACK: Yep.


AUSTIN: Okay!


JANINE: Ohhh.


ALI: Dinner! He had dinner, come on!


AUSTIN: Yeah, you should do a smaller heal, there's a- one second.


JANINE: Also, he was sleeping! We were all sleeping here!


ALI: Yeah, he’s been here for like a week.


AUSTIN: Yeah, that's not- that's still not how this works yall. [laughs, JACK overlaps] You get-


JACK: [overlapping] Also like- it's been a bad like, four or five hours for Lem.


AUSTIN: Well it's been a bad- it's been a bad couple of days, remember? It's been about-


JACK: Oh, right. Sure.


AUSTIN: Oh- wait! You're totally right, this is still the first full day… its been days for them cause they got the whole Marielda story, then we stopped for… [JACK laughs] we stopped for a little bit, and then he fled. So they had more days to heal up than you did.


JACK: Yeah...


AUSTIN: I would take half of your HP back, I'd say that you were able to settle in and rest once? So… as long as- so, half your max HP you shouldve gotten back.


JACK: Okay.


AUSTIN: Also consume a ration to do that. Or I guess he fed you, you don't have to consume a ration.


JANINE: He fed us, but only using our own food.


AUSTIN: [chuckles] Right.


[ALI laughs]


JANINE: He uses all our rations- [AUSTIN overlaps]


AUSTIN: [overlapping] Since you got here, exactly! Um… att this point the anchor are fanning out- or rather- not fanning out, they are leaving their fires that they're setting and they're closing in on everybody? There are… there should only be eight total, so there's one too many here, okay. So there are seven left. Lem, you've been shot.


JACK: Yeah, I think Lem… I mean- where have I been shot? Have I been shot in the shoulder or something?


AUSTIN: Yeah I think the shoulder, you took one damage, right?


JACK: Yeah, I think Lem goes down? And then tries to get up as quickly as possible?


AUSTIN: [amused] Okay…


JACK: I don't think getting shot in the shoulder necessarily is the sort of thing you can just stand there, and be like “oh! Oh, no!”


AUSTIN: Right.


JACK: “A shot in my shoulder!” Um…. and so I think Lem kinda stumbles down the steps of the porch? And into the kinda, semi-circle made by these anchor? Here. And holds up a hand with one of the rapiers in it and says 


JACK (as Lem): Stop! This is a holy place!


AUSTIN: Hm. What's your intention here?


JACK: Uh, essentially I want to try and de- my-


AUSTIN: Right, yeah.


JACK: De-escalate a conflict? Defuse a conflict?


AUSTIN: Yeah, that fair. What's your- let's go over your bonds and also your alignment, and we’ll come back to Adaire and Hella’s also.


JACK: Sure. So.. I am neutral, nominaly? I try to avoid a conflict or defuse a tense situation? Uh, and my bonds are “Fero's happiness at the destruction of Nacre is deeply troubling. I will seek to protect what he wishes to destroy.” 


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


JACK: “Ephrim should not have taken the blade he carries; I will seek to ensure his faith does not lead to other, rasher decisions.” Unfortunately, that didn't go well. And “Hella is a rock, let her presence anchor me.”


AUSTIN: That's some good words in that-


JACK: [overlapping] And I think-


AUSTIN: -Adaire and Hella, can I get your alignments too?


JANINE: Uh… my alignment is… neutral, make an ally of someone powerful.


ALI: And my alignment… is evil, to destroy something rather than understand it.


AUSTIN: Great. Give me a defy danger charisma, Lem.


JACK: Sure. I think this action is in part motivated by the avoid conflict thing? And also by my bond with Hella, right?


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: Like, Hella is just being taken capt- seemingly being taken captive… and I think Lem is trying to anchor himself in this situation by her?


AUSTIN: Uh-huh. Gimme that-


JACK: [overlapping] So I'm gonna roll… charisma. [pause] That's a seven!


AUSTIN: Uh… they say- the anchor all hear you say that and they stand down, but the three humans do not. Or the two humans and the dog do not. In fact, the one with the hatchet steps forward? And the dog steps with him? And then for a moment you see him, and then he’s gone. So you're able to de-escalate it by getting the anchor to respond to your plea that this is a holy place.


JACK: Who do I see, and then is gone?


AUSTIN: The- the guy with the hatchets. Like- they kinda take a step back? And then he steps forward and fades from your view.


JACK: He disappears??


AUSTIN: You cannot put your eyes on him!


JACK: Ohh, dear.


AUSTIN: The way the boat did before.


JACK: Ohh, dear. Okay. [laughs]


AUSTIN: Uh, Hadrian! The guy with the bow is now taking aim at you, clearly.


ART: Alright! Uh… charge him? Try to close that distance and put a sword in him.


AUSTIN: Uh, gimme… or, tell me what your bonds are really quick, and your alignment.


ART: Yeah, uh… “I trust Hella to carry me through troubled times, I don't trust her sense of direction”


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


ART: “Fun is fun, but fero would let my family die. Never trust him”


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


ART: “Throndir’s morality is a broken clock, I must lead him to the correct time” that probably would’ve changed in the end and bounced on us…


AUSTIN: Yeah…


ART: I mean that's not like a moral failure of his, that's not what I meant to imply… uh… “Adaire has a silver tongue, but metals are only sacred if they're blessed”


AUSTIN: Okay. Good. uh… what is this, you're just trying to close the distance before he can hit you?


ART: Yeah. Which I guess is dexterity?


AUSTIN: Yeah. Yes, you're going to need to close the distance to get into hack and slash distance basically, to get into melee range. So yeah, give me a dexterity check- not check, uh… Defy Danger, dex 


ART: Defy Danger, yeah… That was really bad.


AUSTIN: That was- that was terrible! That was a five… take five damage! That pierces right through your armor- or, what's- it would pierce one armor, if you have one armor.


ART: Oh, I decided there was no way- time to put on armor, so it pierces right through the clothes I was wearing.


AUSTIN: Okay! So take five, and you're able to get- you're able to get up to like, where Hella is? And he's like backpedalling- after hiring that first shots, you're not able to get into melee distance with him yet. Um… and then i'm gonna make these people disappear for a second. There we go. Adaire, you're the only one back at that porch still, how’s it going?


JANINE: Yeah… I- okay. The thing I wanna do immediately is, I wanna run up to Lem?


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


JANINE: And swap out one of his- one of the dueling rapiers for Hella’s sword?


AUSTIN: Oh, good!


JANINE: -’Cause he looks kinda clumsy? And that might help him more, but also I wanna stand really fucking close to him, because that dude is definitely gonna try to come back and surprise us!


[JACK laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah, correct.


JACK: Yeah…


JANINE: [laughing] So I feel like maybe that might be safer


AUSTIN: That's a move, that counts as your move for that round- that's what you're doing. Cool. Hella, you're still down on one knee with shackles on.


ALI: Oh… no, but we’re in it. So…


AUSTIN: Oh, you're in it. Oh, yeah!


ALI: It's time to fucking break these shackles.


AUSTIN: [quietly] Yes! What's that look like?


ALI: [laughing] I want to flex these shits off.


[JACK and JANINE laugh]


AUSTIN: Yes… mommy’s gotta go to work!


ALI: Yeah! I just fucking pull my wrists apart, no! Like, I was gonna talk to them, I put them on. Y’know, to be nice.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


ALI: No! No more!


AUSTIN: [amused] This sounds like Bend Bars, Lift Gates!


ALI: Yeah! Is that a strength roll? You're looking at it, right?


AUSTIN: Oh, yeah. Of course, yeah, yeah


ALI: Well, that's an eleven.


AUSTIN: That's an eleven, what’s good. She just fucking like “BRAH!” [ALI laughs] like this was- I was being nice! I let you put this on, as like a show of….


ALI: Right! And now they understand that, that they should like, talk to me. Um… and now they're not, and that's too bad.


ART: Whenever anyone travels with Hadrian they realize just how rude the fucking world is! That's- [ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: The- as you do that, the man with hatchets fades into view to Lem’s left? Uh, Lem! There's a man with hatches and he’s swinging them at youuuu! What do you do?


JACK: Uh, I'm going to- I'm gonna try and roll out of the way. And, ideally, stab him with one of the rapiers?


AUSTIN: Okay so it's that a- are you in melee? Are you like, trying to exchange blows here? Or are you protecting yourself first?


JANINE: Do it with Hellas sword…


AUSTIN: Okay, so- go ahead and defy danger first.


JACK: Okay, this is defy danger… what is like, a duck and roll…?


AUSTIN: Duck is dex, ducking and rolling would be dex.


JACK: Oof… [singsong tone] Lem’s about to get hit with a hatchet!


AUSTIN: you would be able to roll- so let me- before you roll. Unless you've already done it. You could roll hack and slash, and there's a chance you won't take damage? But there's also a chance you will. You could roll defy danger to get into a position where you can hack and slash safely? Cause he will be out of range.


JACK: Okay, I-


AUSTIN: I guess- you know what, I think this is just hack and slash, actually.


JACK: [overlapping] Yeah, I don't know…


AUSTIN: I think you are gonna fight? And that's caught up in the way hack and slash works, that like, if you roll well you don't get hin. So I don't think there's a defy danger here to not… if your end goal is to stab that dude, this is hack and slash.


JACK: Do I narrate before I roll, or…?


AUSTIN: You can start to narrate before you roll, and then you roll and-


JACK: So I think- think ducking is probably not actually what I want to do in this situation. Lem is tired, he’s had enough of this stuff, he is probably bigger than this guy? Um… who is a human?


AUSTIN: Ehhh, this is a big ‘ol human. This is a big ‘ol ordennan.


JACK: Sure.


AUSTIN: [struggling] Hmm…. But yeah, [JACK overlaps] I'm fine with it… you're an orc...


JACK: [overlapping] What I'm try and do is just like, catch his wrist as he swings his hatchet at me?


AUSTIN: Hm. Okay, I like that


JACK: Like, “Nope! Don't do that!” 


AUSTIN: So, is your goal to then counter attack once you do that?


JACK: Yeah, I'm just gonna go at him with the- uh…. This is-


AUSTIN: Uh-huh!


JACK: The rapier is… close, so yeah, I’ll try to hit him with the rapier.


AUSTIN: You don't wanna use Hella’s sword that Adaire gave you?


JACK: Ummh! I'm frightened of it Austin!


AUSTIN: Okay, that's fair, then use dexterity here!


JANINE: [laughs] Oh my god...


AUSTIN: Uh-huh!


JANINE: That's what I get for trying to help…
 
JACK: Would you- well, you killed that anchor with it. Uh…. okay.


JANINE: I thought you might have better strength than dexterity, is all.


AUSTIN: That is correct, right?


JANINE: [JACK overlaps, unintelligible] 


JACK: [overlapping] Alright, I'm gonna use- [laughs] I'm gonna use the sword! I think- because what happens is, Adaire steps forward and hands it to me in about this moment?


AUSTIN: Yes. perfect.


[ALI laughs]


JACK: And so Lem just kind of swings?


AUSTIN:  Uh-huh….


JANINE: Also, to be clear, a big part of this is also- [JACK overlaps] I wanna have this rapier-


JACK: [overlapping] Yes! Perfect!


AUSTIN: That's a six. That's a six! Is anyone… Adaire, are you helping at all?


JANINE: Yes, totally [laughs]


AUSTIN: Note that, again, as always, if you fail on an aid or interfiere, I get to make moves hard. If you get a 7-9, on an aid or interfiere [JACK overlaps] you are caught up-


JACK: [overlapping] Oh, I leveled! [laughs]


AUSTIN: Oh, nice. If you get a 7-9 then you will be also affected by the negative results of whatever the roll is. That is the- that is the question here!


JANINE: I wonder if it would be better for me to attack separately


AUSTIN: I- that's also a thing you can do separately. Um… but it means that- it means that I get to make a move right now, as hard as I want. Because Jack failed.


JANINE: Uh… I mean, I already did technically step forward in the hopes of like, helping Lem, so I should probably commit, right?


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


JANINE: Yeah. Oh, I don't have a bond with Lem, that's not good…


AUSTIN: Ugh… [pained noises from ALI] You barely know him, to be fair.


JANINE: I- that's true.


AUSTIN: This is how new bonds get written though, y’know? One way or the other, [laughs] either- either this is a moment where Adaire very clearly [JACK laughs] is out of her own skin, or this is a moment where she steps forward and didn't need to.


JANINE: Uhhhh…. Okay, I should aid.


AUSTIN: Hey! [everyone cheers] That's a seven, so that means that you… are- you're able to bump that six up to a seven, but that does mean that you are also a target in what comes next?


JACK: Okay.


AUSTIN: Like, you're able to aid… but also you expose yourself to danger, retribution or cost. In this case, that cost is…? Thit counter attack that comes in. um… we’ll roll your damage in a second, Lem, I just wanna paint this picture before we do this- this is gonna be the best of these following 2d10 dice… so that's five? That is two armor piercing? as this guy starts spinning at you with his hatchets. So you both take five here. Uh… Lem, what's your counter attack with the sword look like?


JACK: Uh… it's- it's useless, it's just like- the sword is in my right hand, and I just swing at the guy?


AUSTIN: [laughs] Okay, gimme damage. And also Adaire, how do you help, specifically?


JANINE: I mean, is this maybe the moment where I give him a blade he can use…?


AUSTIN: Oh, yeah, that's fair. That's the moment.


JANINE: Like is that when this happens? That we swap swords?


AUSTIN: Totally. Okay, go ahead and give me- just damage roll, Lem.


[JACK laughs]


AUSTIN: That's two damage, okay… [JANINE chuckles] Um… that has one piercing or two piercing or something, right? Maybe?


JACK: The- Hella’s sword?


AUSTIN: Yeah, Hella’s sword.


ALI: Yes, yeah.


AUSTIN: One or two?


ALI: Two.


AUSTIN: Oh, nice! Okay. So yeah, that manages to actually do a little damage.


JACK: I think it just kinda grazes him. Like, I think I stumble.


AUSTIN: Yeah, but it- it catches him. The numbers are the numbers.


JACK: Okay.


AUSTIN: You manage to like catch him in the arm, not enough to stop him from spinning at you with these hatchets and getting a couple hits on both of you? But that’s- that happens. Hadrian?


JANINE: Can I also attack, or..?


AUSTIN: Uh- let's- you are-


JANINE: Okay.


AUSTIN: You get your thing, which was handing the sword, so let's bounce up now to Hadrian and Hella, who are now standing side by side [ALI laughs], looking at this dude with the fucking bow. What are yall up to?


ART: I wanna hit this guy with my sword.


AUSTIN: Okay- he’s still out of range for you. Unless you make a defy danger again to get closer.


ALI: Am I close enough to him?


AUSTIN: Nah, yall are next to each other at this point.


ALI: [tsks] Oh, I guess he stepped back…


AUSTIN: Right. He stepped back after shooting Hadrian [laughs] on the chest.


AUSTIN: Uh… yeah, I guess I'm still trying to get there, I'm still running.


AUSTIN: Okay… Hella what are you doing while this is happening, same thing?


ALI: Uh, yeah, I would like to attack him very much!


AUSTIN: Okay so- both of you give me a Defy Danger, dex.


ART: Boom!


AUSTIN: Hadrian closes in!


ALI: Ah-ha!


AUSTIN: Oh… this guy’s about to get fucked up. [ALI laughs] Y’all manage to close- I think it's just both of you coming at him super quick? He’s like “U-ahhh!”. And he fires off one arrow and then another one real quick, it's kind of impressive? But both of them miss completely. Both of you can go ahead and give me a hack and slash.


ART: Alright [ALI overlaps], it's the first with that new-


ALI: [overlapping] Do you want to do this like, in unison?


AUSTIN: Oh, yeah! Let's do a count in, let's [ALI laughs]- let's go to time.is- no, let's just… oh yeah, it's the first time you're using that new sword you have!


ALI: [gasps] Oh, lord...


ART: Well, I missed.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


ALI: I didn't.


AUSTIN: Okay so, Hella let's- gimme your damage first. You're gonna trade damage with this guy, ‘cause you rolled a nine. Hadrian rolled a six, Hella rolled a nine and then did TWELVE DAMAGE!


ALI: Uh-huh!


AUSTIN: But not with your sword, with your hands??


ALI: Uh… yes.


AUSTIN: Okay. You're just beating this dude?


ALI: I just fucking punch him in his dumb face! and then-


AUSTIN: You take four damage, as he like, daggers you again and again in your fucking stomach.


ALI: [sigh] Okay… [laughs]


AUSTIN: Uh… the blade- oh my god…. That blade is really bad… what's your damage, Hadrian?


ART: Uh… d10 plus 1d4 on a quest.


AUSTIN: Oh, you're on a quest! And then roll an additional d6. So roll 1d10, plus d4, plus d6. That last d6… does not care about armor. [laugh] Adaire in chat says “They call my fists the original Ordennan Steel” [ALI laughing off-mic] which is honestly a very Sean thing to say? I know you don't know Sean, but… uh, Hella take eleven damage as this blade of Samothes cuts into you


ALI: Uh, excuse me?


AUSTIN: Yeah. 


ALI: Hey what?


AUSTIN: Y’all tried to attack this guy at the same time! And… that sword did not do good things. On the plus side! This dude is dead.


ALI: Uh, I'm down to nine…


AUSTIN: Fair.


ALI: Just a heads-up. [pause] I should’ve saved that reroll but- we’re good.


AUSTIN: Hadrian, what are you at? 


ART: I'm at seventeen!


AUSTIN: Uh, you're at eighteen, ‘cause you did one at that last die.


ART: Oh, that's great!


AUSTIN: Uh-huh!


ART: That's encouraging! [ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: You just like… feel the anger of Hella run through you? And it's like- oh yeah, you're pumped.


ART: Oh my god…


ALI: This is bad- this sword’s bad? Hey-


ART: [overlapping] You ever wonder if we’re the bad guys?


[ALI and AUSTIN laugh]


ALI: They're burning this house down…


AUSTIN: Uh… Adaire. What are you doing?


JANINE: I'm gonna [AUSTIN overlaps] hit… this hatchet guy, I'm going after the hatchet guy.


AUSTIN: [overlapping] There's a dog barking… there's a guy who has hatchets... how are you- what are you doing? What's that look like?


JANINE: Uh… i'm gonna use this dope-ass old dueling rapier, [laughs] I just- i'm done with Lem, I guess.


AUSTIN: Okay. Yeah. 


JANINE: ‘Cause I know how to rapier, [AUSTIN overlaps] and this is a nicer rapier than mine.


AUSTIN: [overlapping] Gimme a hack and slash. Yeah.


JANINE: And I get to use dexterity for that, I believe.


AUSTIN: You do. That's a bad roll though! oh- no, it's a seven, you got there.


JANINE: Uh, yeah.


AUSTIN: Yt was marked with red for some reason, I think cause you rolled a one in there.


JANINE: And then four, too.


AUSTIN: Yeah, totally. Um… so. Gimme your damage and then we can co-narrate a little bic, because on a seven you kinda both…


JANINE: Uh-huh.


AUSTIN: -do your damage. Ugh, that ain't great.


JANINE: God, I…


AUSTIN. It’s piercing though! It’s piercing, piercing is good.


JANINE: And- its new, the weight’s off. The balance in mine is different….


AUSTIN: So you did two damage which gets through to him, and again you kinda like, poke in and get past some of his armor. Or that's- I don't know, I rolled 2d4 which is completely wrong for what this guy is doing, apologies [JANINE laughs] Um… you take ten damage. 


JANINE: Oh! I'm dead?


AUSTIN: Uh-huh?


ALI: [alarmed] Wait, what?


JANINE: That’s good…


AUSTIN: Adaire took ten damage.


JANINE: [laughing] I'm at zero now?


AUSTIN: Um, you like- [JANINE overlaps]


JANINE: [overlapping] I don't have a lot of health, and you already took five, [laughs] so…


JACK: Oh my god!


AUSTIN: Uh-huh! Adaire, we’ll come back to you in a second-


JANINE: Great.


AUSTIN: This is just like- Adaire stabs him straight in the chest? And then just like “slash, slash! Axe, axe! Dead”


JANINE: This is why I don't help people. [JACK laughs] This is what happens. 


AUSTIN: Uh…. Lem? Adaire-


ART: [overlapping] They were gonna burn everything down, [laughs] you were gonna have to do something. [ALI laughs]


JANINE: The house seemed to be doing fine, it was just the trees!


AUSTIN: Oh, you are not dead, that's not true! Right? Isn't it not true? You had armor on, didn't you? 


JANINE: I'm at… two then, cause I didn't take armor for the previous hit.


AUSTIN: Yes, okay.


JANINE: Okay, that's good.


AUSTIN: You're still ALIve. Close one! It ain't over, there's still this dog and this guy with axes!


JANINE: [overlapping] Yikes.


JACK: Wow…. Ohhh, man. Um… so. I'm gonna try and- can I use the violin?


AUSTIN: I don't know. You tell me. You can try to use the violin!


JACK: Sure, I mean I'll try to use the violin. I think that like- I think it has one or two strings. And I'm gonna try and heal Adaire with Arcane Art? Uh…


AUSTIN: Give me.. What do you do with the sword?


JACK: Hella’s sword?


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: I guess I drop it.


AUSTIN: Okay!


JANINE: Oh, boy…


AUSTIN: Uh… give me a roll. That's gonna be a minus one for the shape that the violin is in


JACK: Yeah. It's a charisma rol… that's an eleven.


AUSTIN: Okay, that's an eleven! That's still really good! So go ahead and…


JACK: Uh, 1d8 damage. And I get- is it me or them who get plus two forward to damage? By the move invigorate.


AUSTIN: I think they- I think they get plus two.


JACK: Ah, yes, they do. Yes. alright, 1d8. Here we go. [laughs loudly] that's a one!


AUSTIN: [amused] How’d you do, Jack? 


JACK: I rolled a one…


AUSTIN: That's a one! Uh-huh. How you feel?


JACK: I rolled an eleven, and then a one. 


AUSTIN: [sigh]


JANINE: The plus two is nice…


JACK: Pits and ladders… 


AUSTIN: [laughs] Huh… speaking of. Barbelo…. [sigh] God.


ALI: Wait-


AUSTIN: I just- what do you mean wait? No. You're over there, [ALI laughs] you just killed that dude.


ALI: But I have like my… thing where I look at somebody and they attack me instead… [laughs]


AUSTIN: That's… not the thing that's about to happen, you're good. There is a blurr again, and Barbelo and the guy with hatchets are gone from your sight. Also gone? The Blade in the Dark


[ALI gasps]


JACK: Oh, no!! [silence] noooo!


AUSTIN: I asked very carefully where you put it.


JACK: Yeah so- [sigh] Y’know, not to get too inside baseball, sometimes you have to make decisions because you think they're gonna be interesting, but then! Y’know! There's ways and ways of interesting, huh?


AUSTIN: Uh-huh! I know I'm not supposed to say my moves, but hidden hound here has a move that I wrote called “make something important invisible”, so…


JACK: Is he called hidden hound in your notes? Is that the official name for this dog?


AUSTIN: Yeah, I wrote- I wrote it, I wrote up this monster earlier. Its name is Hidden Hound. Its- its a dog…


JACK: Called Barbelo.


JANINE: It sounds like a cartoon show.


JACK: Oh god, so the blade in the dark has gone.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh, and the hatchet guy, and the Hidden Hound.


JACK: [laughing] I- I’d like to try discern realities, please Austin?


AUSTIN: Sure. [JACK overlaps] How does that look like?


JACK: Uh… [overlapping] to attempt to find out where that guy has gone. What that looks like is-


AUSTIN: Paint me a picture.


JACK: -is, Lem looks down to pick up the sword again? [AUSTIN laughs] And I think this is the first time Lem has kinda realized like, “Oh, I hit that guy with Hella’s sword! Oh, Hella’s- Oh. Wait a second” 


AUSTIN: UHHH [laughs]


JACK: And it's just- there's just the grass, and there's boot marks from the anchor in the grass, and there's fire- and it's just a lot of quick cuts of Lem like, glancing back at the house, and back at the treeline… and like the water moving?


AUSTIN: Yep


JACK: So I'm gonna try and roll…


AUSTIN: It’s wisdom.


JACK: ...wisdom, here.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


JACK: That's an eight!


AUSTIN: That's an eight! Which means you get one question. From that list.


JACK: Okay… [amused] Uh, let me just look at this list… [laughs]


AUSTIN: [amused] What happened here recently? What is about to happen? What should I be on the lookout for? What here is useful or valuable to me? Who is really in control here? What here is not what it appears to be?


JACK: [laughing] None of them are explicitly sword related, are they?


AUSTIN: No, but many of them- a lot of them [JANINE overlaps] will help you here.


JANINE: [overlapping] Swords are useful…


JACK: Yeah, I was thinking- yeah, what here is useful or valuable to me? I think that's the question Lem is actively asking himself right now?


AUSTIN: Fair. Uh… the footsteps, in the sand? The footsteps are in the sand, you can follow them from the footsteps in the sand.


JACK: I'm just gonna run, I'm- I'm going in that direction.


AUSTIN: Okay, let me reveal this shit…


JACK: Is that like, out past the anchor? Where am I going?


AUSTIN: No, they actually head south on this island, towards the southern shore.


JACK: Oh.


AUSTIN: They… are here!


JACK: Oh, there he is! There's the dog! [laughs]


AUSTIN: Also there? A boat! [JACK overlaps] That they're getting into.


JACK: [overlapping] Uh no.


AUSTIN: Lem, what do you do?


JACK: Uh, how fast can I move- like, in comparison- is it worse trying to catch up to them?


AUSTIN: I- A lot of things are worse trying?


JACK: Okay, I'm gonna try to run up and catch up with them, and I'm also going to… um, so I'm currently carrying one rapier.


AUSTIN: uh-huh.


JACK: I'm gonna try and…. Oh! Um- no, I know what i'm gonna do. I know exactly what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna roll Metal Hurlant, which is “When I shout with a great force or play a shattering note, choose a target and roll constitution. On a 10+ the target takes damage and is deafened for a few minutes, on a 7–9 you still damage your target, but it’s out of control: you get to choose an additional target nearby.” And what I'm doing here is I'm just cutting the two final strings of the violin with the rapier.


AUSTIN: [hisses] Okay… gimme a constitution roll. That's really good, that's a great image.


JACK: Here we go… that's an eight! okay!


AUSTIN: Which means you do damage, so go ahead and give me that damage.


JACK: Uhhhh.


AUSTIN: ‘Cause- is it a specific amount or do you-


JACK: It’s 1d10.


AUSTIN: Okay.


JACK: I just nearly wrote “1d10” in the box [AUSTIN laughs] That's an eight.


AUSTIN: Ooof, that's a good fucking hit! Um, okay, and then I get to decide where the other half goes?


JACK: Umm, let me just- let me read this through? 


AUSTIN: Yeah, you-


JACK: I still damage my target, but it’s out of control, you get to choose an additional target nearby. Yeah.


AUSTIN: I will! Okay… [sigh] oh, boy… okay. God, what's the pattern say? Who else gets hit by this? Boy, no one is in a good shape, huh? [ALI and JANINE laugh] Ain't no one looking good! Except- I guess Hadrian looks okay? Um…


ART: [laughs] Nearby is very… generous for the relation in between... Lem, the boat and Hadrian but I mean… [everyone laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah...yeah… well- I mean, I think it's like an AoE. Well, not like a AoE but like, Lem in at the center, the boat is pretty far… Lem is at the center where he broke these strings… tell me how this works, cause that’ll help me figure this out.


JACK: How Metal Hurlant works?


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: I think it's like…


AUSTIN: Like, what is happening with the pattern?


JACK: I think it's something to do with- what does the move say? A shattering note, the person is deafened for a few minutes, and they physically take damage. Um… you know how there's semi-conspiracy theories, horror stories about things you can do with audio files?


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


JACK: And then actual real horrifying things where like… in interrogation they’ll play music very loudly, and it really gets to people. And all those stories about tones that can make people do certain things, army research- this is just that.


AUSTIN: Yeah


JACK: Like, this is that, personified.


AUSTIN: Yeah. So, I know what happens and it's none of you, don't worry about it, everything’s fine. 


JACK: [amused] Its Samol! No, no, no!!


AUSTIN: This man gets into the boat, and is like covering his ears and coughing up blood… and he's pushing himself away, the dog is barking and like, licking at his face… and the boat begins to drift away. I put them in under the boat by mistake [laughs]


JACK: Oops, he drowned.


AUSTIN: He's dead, that's it, he drowned! Ah, hes- hes very close to dead. So… I mean- and it's just like drifting away? ‘Cause remember, the island is kind of adrift also?


JACK: Yeah…


AUSTIN: And so it’s drifting. What are y’all doing as this boat drifts away?


ART: Jumping at the boat? Trying to like, swim out to it?


AUSTIN: Okay. Gimme like- give me- what's the look like? From Hadrian?


ART: Uh…. I mean Hadrian-


AUSTIN: [overlapping, amused] You have plate armor [everyone laughs], and I think on the first episode we noted that would cost you to sink, and then you could walk, cause…


ART: But specifically I'm not wearing armor… 


AUSTIN: Yep!


ART: Uh- the problem is, Hadrian is such a big boy, I don't know that he swims great, but I guess he grew up in a fishing town, he probably has-


AUSTIN: Yeah!


ART: He probably swims okay?


AUSTIN: Yeah. Well give me a strength roll- a strength Defy Danger, the danger here is being caught between- like, too far out form the boat- from the island.


ART: Sure, there's all sorts of dangers!


AUSTIN: Yeah. You're also swimming through a weird river that goes through the- pasts? Of all of Hieron history, and- who knows what's out there?


ART: I mean, if you put it that way I've never wanted to fail a roll more in my life. 


AUSTIN: [laughing] Ever? [ALI laughs] Uh, you got an eight, so… alright, so you hesitate or- uh….


ART: I mean, it's an easy flinch, right? Hadrian can realize I'm gonna wash up in- y’know, my grandparents’-


AUSTIN: Yeah… well, not even your grandparents, right? Like your great-great-great-great-grandparents who also wouldve never actually existed in this universe. Or in the universe you're from, in the world you're from. But no, I don't think it’s that, I think it's...ugh. If you...hm. I want this to feel substantial, if you can get out there and get this fucking sword and bring it back, like…. That should mean something, there should be a real cost here. Uh- oh, I mean! If you get there...you're gonna be alone with the sword.


ART: I- I'm not sure I've seen enough of that sword yet to be afraid of that?


AUSTIN: No no no no. The sword you promised Samothes you would break.


ART: Oh, right! [ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: Now, I- I just assumed I wouldn’t think about that until it was over. [AUSTIN overlaps] Until the story is over.


AUSTIN: [overlapping] Ah, if you get there- I mean, I think…. [sigh] hm. I mean, I think you have this thought. You start to swim out that way, and you know that if you get on that thing- on that boat- your duty will be to destroy that blade. And Hella will see you destroy that blade.


ART: [huff] Or- hear me out here- I dispatch these two people, I just hang out on the boat till no one can see me, and just die out there!


AUSTIN: [laughing] Oh! I see- yeah! Just yeah!


[ALI laughs]


ART: Just break the sword and die on the boat!


AUSTIN: Uh-huh!


ART: Probably only take a couple days…


AUSTIN: Right, uh-huh.


ART: Um… yeah! I don't know- I don't know that I can keep pushing that off.


AUSTIN: Okay…


ART: I may not have sucked for a little bit there but-  there's a living person and a ghost dog out there.


AUSTIN: That living dude is like, on his lasts.


ART: Oh, I've been rolling like shit- I mean, I don't know what to-


AUSTIN: Yeah, that's fair! The- the thing I will say, the thing I noticed the other night- or the other morning- I woke up in a start, and realized that at this point in the story, Hadrian has defied Samothes… for Hella, but not for Samot? And I thought that was was interesting. But okay, you get out there and there's a guy on a boat who’s coughing up blood, and there's a dog that's barking at you. Um… and you don't see the sword, but you imagine it’s ‘cause this dog is… keeping it invisible.


ART: Sure. Um…


ART (as Hadrian): Give me the sword and you have my word I'll let you live.


AUSTIN (as man): [breathing heavily] Blade’s evil.


ART: I actually- if that were true, I think I’d know. [laughs]


AUSTIN: That's- I mean, that's an interesting perspective.


ALI: [laughs] You can check while- while we’re like, separated.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh


ART: Yeah. I- yeah. We can deal with that later.


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: Uh-huh!


AUSTIN (as man): Blade’s cursed! All this is cursed!


ART (as Hadrian): I- okay.


AUSTIN (as Barbelo): [growls, barks]


AUSTIN: It's a small bark for such a scary dog.


ART (as Hadrian): I appreciate that, I do, but- but that's really not the issue here.


AUSTIN: He shakes his head, and like, looks at your blade?


AUSTIN (as man): Yours!


ART (as Hadrian): My blade is divine.


AUSTIN (as man): [starts laughing, breathes softly] 


AUSTIN: And he's gone. And then the dog like, whimpers, and goes over to his face and nudges it. And you see Hella’s sword there, on the boat. What do you do?


ART: Um… I pick it up. And I ask what here is evil?


AUSTIN: Hm… there are two answers again. But one of them is definite- again, how do you sense- is it a sense? Is it an aura? Traditionally, how does Hadrian sense that?


ART: I think it's a feeling.


AUSTIN: Okay.


ART: I think its like- y’know, it's like looking at something and feeling that- the pit in your stomach, right?


AUSTIN: There is an intense amount of good coming from Hellas sword. It’s like radiating goodness? It wants you- but that's like coming from it, that's a thing saying “its me, I'm good, and that thing you're holding is the worst thing there's ever been”. Uh… about the other blade. The voice from below, Samothes, who you've met at this point, is very clear that this blade has got to go. This blade is an abomination, and an affront to his existence. But the blade in your hand feels as divine as anything. 


ART: Wh- what does sword Samothes want? That's what I- I guess I don't know that's a thing yet, but that's what I, the player, want to know. 


AUSTIN: Yeah… I can make you a bargain here.


ART: Okay!


AUSTIN: If you don't destroy this sword, you lose all of your paladin abilities. But you don't have to destroy it. [ALI laughing off-mic]


ART: I mean, yeah, I'm- [stuttering] I'm not anything without those paladin abilities, if you- [JACK overlaps] I have like, an okay character sheet.


JACK: [overlapping] That doesn't really sound like a bargain, Austin!


AUSTIN: Well- here's what you would keep, let's take a look real quick.


ART: Yeah, uh-huh?


AUSTIN: You would keep…


ART: Hack and Slash, keep that?


AUSTIN: Well, that's not- y'know. Um… you keep Hospitalier, when you heal an ally you heal plus 1d8 damage.


ART: Okay so that means I keep Lay on Hands?


AUSTIN: No.


ART: Well, that's a modification to Lay on Hands, so Hospitalier is gone too.


AUSTIN: Well, no- any time you traditionally- you could use bandages, that would still work. I would still let that work.


ART: Oh, okay.


AUSTIN: Uh… Bloody Aegis, when you take damage you can grit your teeth and accept the blow?


ART: Ohhh okay.


AUSTIN: Which reflects a sort of faith and confidence, more than a power internal to you at this point?


ART: Sure.


AUSTIN: -one given to you? But you would not have Divine Favor…? Is that the one where you pray?


ART: Uh… Divine-


AUSTIN: it’s Divine Guidance.


ART: Divine Favor is the one that gives cleric spells, yeah.


AUSTIN: Oh, okay, gotcha. Um… yeah, you would lose that, and you would lose Smite, and you would lose I Am the Law… and you would lose this quest.


ART: Yeah, I just flipped a coin? And-


AUSTIN: That's not the way this works. Disregard it. I need to know what Hadrian does. Unless Hadrian’s flipping a coin, I didn't know what Hadrian does.


ART: Um. Hadrian breaks the sword.


AUSTIN: Okay. The… uh, fuck. Okay! That's good. What's it look like?


ART: I've never broken a sword before? [laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah- well, how’s he do it?


ART: Um… well that's like, part of this? You can tell that like, that's not how- that wouldn’t work! And I hear you. But do you think I could like- kinda like snap it? Like over his knee?


AUSTIN: No. No, you have to use the blade he gave you for this. That's what Samothes asked you to do. That's the- that's the job he told you.


ART: I legitimately did not... recall that.


AUSTIN: Yeah, that's why he gave you that blade, ‘cause that was the only way to break this.


ART: Uh.. Yeah. I've never broken a sword with a sword before! I mean- I probably have more than one chance at this, right? I- y’know, I put it down and I...swing at it? Is there like something higher, something like a bench or like a seat?


AUSTIN: Yeah, there are seats


ART: Okay, so I put it on one of those, so it's like a little up, I'm not swinging at the ground? And I just kinda swing it at it? Yeah, as Janine helpfully puts in chat “At the joint of the blade and the hilt” is probably a-


AUSTIN: Yeah


ART: At least a weak, good place to start? 


JACK: [overlapping] Are you-


ART: How is the sword made? Like-


JACK: Are you still in the boat?


AUSTIN: Yeah, he's still on the boat.


JACK: Oh, god.


JANINE: [laughing] With the dog…


AUSTIN: With the dog, the dog that's whimpering with this man. Um, all of you see this. [ALI sighs and laughs] This is like, the sun- not the sun, the fire- is making this clear as day. You kinda take a swing at it, like its chopping wood, and it cuts into the metal? It screeches? First like nails on a chalkboard, and then like a voice. 


ART: O- okay…


AUSTIN: It bleeds a little.


ART: It bleeds? 


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: Blood


AUSTIN: It’s a liquid? Its an oily… like, liquid that could be blood.


ART: Uhhh… okay, so that seemed like it was working!


AUSTIN: Uh-huh! Hey, everybody on the shore, what are you all doing?


[silence]


AUSTIN: Also, when you do, your new blade flares purple.


JACK: I don't really… know what the deal with Hella’s sword is? I know its like- my last encounter with this I guess was when Hella killed the star?


[ALI laughing off-mic]


AUSTIN: Yeah


JACK: And I don't know if it's ever been communicated to me really what is going on? With the- oh, I guess in the Marielda game. Yeah, I know.


AUSTIN: Yeah, you know! But you don't know yet. This is all literally happening the week that you all learned about that stuff.


JACK: No, but I mean- hasn't Samol told us? About-


AUSTIN: He hasn't finished the story yet .


ALI: Yeah…


AUSTIN: This literally interrupted-


JANINE: [overlapping] We just stopped at like, the quiet year, right?


JACK: Ohhh, god!


AUSTIN: The quiet year plus a couple of the first- it was like the first two heists.


ALI: Yeah…


JACK: Oh no!


AUSTIN: This is that night. This is the night that- when the anchor attack, is before you all get the end of that story!


JACK: So I think I'm- I'm standing next to Hella? And I'm kinda in a tone that is… so frustratingly out of it, asking like


JACK (as Lem): What's he doing? 


[AUSTIN and ALI laugh]


AUSTIN: Chop. Just chop. …


JANINE: I'm gonna throw a rock?


[JACK laughs]


ALI: You're… dead? I- can you do that?


JANINE: No, I'm- I'm at like three...


JACK:  [overlapping] No, she has like two health.


AUSTIN: [overlapping]  No, she didn't die, she didn’t die, she has like two HP. Three HP.


ALI: Okay…


JANINE: I'm three!


AUSTIN: But like, it bloody. It is like, in a bad way?


JANINE: Yeah, I- I'm not throwing a knife, like-


AUSTIN: Good


ALI: Yeah…


AUSTIN: What's the- [JANINE overlaps] what's your intention?


JANINE: [overlapping] He’s breaking the thing and the thing is Hella’s! Like-


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: Right.


JANINE: That's all that Adaire sees here, it's like “That's Hella’s sword, I brought it out for her, now he's in a boat trying to break it like hes fucking… I don't fucking know what's happening, but he's breaking Hella’s things!” so I wanna try and stop him by throwing a rock!


JACK: Is the boat like rocking?


JANINE: [overlapping] That’s all I can do!


ALI: Can I ask a question?


AUSTIN: [overlapping] Yeah, the boat is [JACK overlaps] totally rocking.


JACK: [overlapping] This isn't like, graceful, is it? This is just like-


AUSTIN: No...yeah.


ALI: Can I-


AUSTIN: It's very human. Yes Hella, what's up?


ALI: When the sword screeches, does it sound different to me?


AUSTIN: It sounds like the singing that you heard, long ago. Except that instead of singing, they're screeching.


ALI: [laughs] ‘Cause the- the Heirloom move that I have doesn't say anything in its… message? That I have to be holding it.


AUSTIN: Oh, word? 


ALI: Yeah! It just says when I consult the spirits. So if I can hear it-


AUSTIN: What's that look like at range?


ALI: [laughing] I don't know.


AUSTIN: How do you call to the blade?


ALI: I think that it's like- ‘cause that's what i'm asking, if she- cause, if it's like a dog whistle, where everyone is hearing like… [AUSTIN overlaps] a horrible noise.


AUSTIN: [overlapping] I think everyone’s hearing the screeching that you always hear. They're hearing the voices screeching. But you know what voices they are!


ALI: Right! Is that-


AUSTIN: [overlapping] So does Lem, this is the Tristero choir. Like, you recognize those voices, he was there!


ALI: Right, okay. 


AUSTIN: But give me an Heirloom, totally!


ALI: [sigh] Oh, boy howdy… that's a ten.


AUSTIN: That's a ten! On a ten plus I give you good details! I think you've never gotten that!


[SONG “The Boat” STARTS PLAYING]


ALI: [laughing] It's the only time I've succeeded in this roll...


AUSTIN: [amused] They will give you insight relating to the current situation, and might ask you some questions in return. Fuck. [sigh] Uh, so here's what we get. Blade goes up. Like, Hadrians? Hadrian, you swing it down and hit, and then we get like a flash? And then, all of you are in a airy room that's… like a stone room in a castle, that's adjacent to a throne room? You're on like a stone balcony, looking out among a medieval town that is like bustling, and you can see smoke rising from the chimneys, and there's green hills off in the distance. Hella, this is the place that you've seen in the flashes of the sword.


[“The Boat” CONTINUES TILL THE END]
