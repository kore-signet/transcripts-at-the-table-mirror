[muffled clap followed by decent clap]


AUSTIN: That was pretty good


ALI: Yeah


AUSTIN: That last one was good, use that last one.


ALI [sighs, relieved]: I-- I will-- I will do that.


AUSTIN: That’s my suggestion.


[JACK sighs, relieved]


AUSTIN: Alright, let’s shake it out everyone. We’re going to have fun today! It’s gunna be a good time.


JACK: Oh no


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: I love you all, everything’s gunna go great.


JACK: That’s an ominous thing to say to someone at the beginning. 


ALI: Yeah, I don’t know.


AUSTIN: No, I-- I-- I think it’s high tension but it doesn’t ne-- it shouldn’t be-- it should be. This is not going to kill Samothes, it will- mmm...


[ALI laughs]


JACK: Jesus christ Austin.


AUSTIN: I don’t want


ART (as HADRIAN): Huh


JACK (as LEM): What’s that supposed to mean Hadrian?


ART (as HADRIAN): I-- ex-- excuse me? 


[ALI giggling back from the mic]


JACK (as LEM): Didn’t you go ‘huh’ Hadrian? Or was that Samol?


AUSTIN: That was, that was Hadrian


ART: I mean, that was Art chuckling.


[AUSTIN laughs, ALI’s laugh joins]


AUSTIN: I do like Lem as being like a little fucking testy though.


ART (as HADRIAN): Ah that was-- that was just-- I thought that was a funny thing to say.


[JACK and ALI quietly laughing]


AUSTIN: Is that Hadrian? [laughing]


JACK (as LEM) [laughing]: Well alright Hadrian.


[ALI cackling]


AUSTIN: Each- I can hear the blender- Each has certain locations associated-


JACK: That wasn’t the blender, my mic was muted.


AUSTIN: Oh.


[audible hissing noise]


SYLVIA: That might be my pipes.


AUSTIN: That’s your pipes? Okay.


SYLVIA: Sorry.


AUSTIN: Uhm.


JACK: Pipes?


AUSTIN: So.


[This is the 4:00 minute point]


AUSTIN (as NARRATOR): And then, you’re even closer still outside the castle proper, but close enough to look up and look your god in the eye. To see his robes, blue and silver, to see his face, a few wrinkles, laugh lines. A sense of fulfillment, and it’s in recognizing that in him - 


AUSTIN (as himself): I can’t believe this fucking truck is fucking me right now. Ali, I fucking can’t believe it. This fucking truck, I’m gunna start over for this whole section. [heavy breathe in] God damn it.


ART: Well this is-- this is a good time for me to talk about, talk about my-- my problem with the, The Star Wars comic books which I just started reading.


AUSTIN: How are they-- how are they going? Is this the new one?


ALI: [overlapping Austin a bit] Which one is this?


AUSTIN: Is it the one with the Han Solo ex-wife situation?


ART: Ah-- that-- I will eventually get to that, yes.


AUSTIN: Okay.


ART: But I-- I’ve also-


AUSTIN [over ART]: Spoilers.


ART: read Darth Vader the Comic, I’m only like an issue in so-


AUSTIN: Okay.


ART: whatever. But like, what really kinda got to me is the first issue starts with like a crawl,


[AUSTIN hum affirmative]


ART: like, you know like a Star Wars crawl.


[AUSTIN hum affirmative]


ART: But it’s from the perspective of the Empire? And it like sort of, breaks the crawl for me, I always thought the crawl was impartial.


[ALI noise of hesitation]


AUSTIN: No, the crawl’s not impartial.


KEITH: The crawl says stuff like “The Evil Empire”.


[AUSTIN laughing, affirmative noise]


ALI: Yeaaaah.


ART: The Empire is evil!


ALI: [sigh] ehhh, depends on which side you’re lookin’ at.


[AUSTIN laughs]


ART: Remember when Anakin killed all those kids?


ALI: ehhhh, that was-


AUSTIN [over Ali]: Right, that was before there was an Empire. The Empire didn’t exist yet


ALI: Yeah!


AUSTIN: So that’s not the Empire.


KEITH: Also-- also, Anakin, doesn’t, he’s not going like “I killed all those kids ‘cause I’m Evil”, he killed them so no one he knew would die.


[ALI laughs at ‘Evil”]


[AUSTIN and ALI laugh]


ART: And then a lot of people died.


ALI: He knew those kids, wait. 


ART [inaudible]: And he also knew those kids.


ALI: He knew those kids, he lived in the same building as those kids.


KEITH: I didn’t say they were perfect movies, I just said that’s why he did it.


ALI [skeptical]: Okay


AUSTIN: Yeah, it literally says “The Evil Galactic Empire” in the first sentence.


[KEITH hums affirmative]


ART: Yeah, no.


AUSTIN: No, second sentence, second sentence.


ART: And then it goes on to be like “They created this machine to destroy planets”. I think you’re allowed to call someone evil when they build a Death Star.


[This is the 6:03 minute point]


AUSTIN: It’s a deterrent


ALI: Ahh. What if those planets don’t need to be there? What if they’re destroying evil planets?


AUSTIN: Right? See? [pause] Also it’s called the Death Star. 
[KEITH and ALI laugh]


KEITH: I feel like, you guys are always talking about wrestling and I still feel like I know less about wrestling than I know about football and I don’t know anything about football


ALI: Ahh, the thing about wrestling is... everyone’s nice and good and friends with each other.


KEITH: I felt-- I thought that was the opposite, is,  and that they fight


ALI: Uh, well, friends will fight bad people, don’t worry about the bad ones because who cares


JACK: If you get-


KEITH: But how do you know which ones are the bad ones?


JACK: You don’t!


ALI: You’ll know cause- cause you’ll know which ones are the-- The ones that are friends all talk constantly about how good friends they are. [laughs]


JACK: Yeah.


ALI [laughing]: And that’s how you’ll know


JACK: Wrestling’s what-


KEITH: So none of the bad ones are friends with each other?


JACK: No, they’re pals sometimes. Sometimes there’s bad people who are all friends together, but they-- they’re not true friends.


ALI: Right?


ART: Right. It’s a lot of morality plays really


KEITH [interrupting ART]: half of these-


JACK: Yeah


KEITH: Okay


ALI: I’m being so vague about this cause now there’s two groups of friends, and they’re all good. They’re all the best.


KEITH: But do they fight each other?


ALI: No.


ART: Not yet.


KEITH: Not yet.


ALI: [gaps] They did! No they did! I saw a picture of Big E like, throwing Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns was on the back looking startled and it fucking killed me.


[JACK laughing, ALI joins]


KEITH: What if, hold on, what if they had to do a shuffle and then some of the friends had to go to the other friends?


[ALI gasps]


KEITH: And then the reverse?


ALI [in awe]: What if they were just like a group of five friends? What if Roman-


KEITH: Oh so this-- so this a-- this is a twosome and a threesome?


ALI: Yeah, there the-- there was a threesome, one of them betrayed the other-


KEITH: Betrayed?


ALI: Yeah! By being [laughs] so Seth Rollins betrayed Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns by suddenly beating them with a chair, um, so hard that he broke one chair and then [voice breaking] pulled another out and kept beating them. [crying]


KEITH [laughing]: Why did he do that?


ALI [laughing]: [incoherent] Cause he was BAAAAD!


KEITH: I thought he was a nice boy!


ALI: He! 


KEITH: You guys, I think Ali’s gunna cry.


[ALI laughs] 


KEITH: Ali’s very legitimately upset about this thing that already had happened.


ART: It happened a long time and was fake


ALI [overlapping ART]: It happen a really long time ago and like- [breathless laugh] 


[EVERYONE laughs]


ALI: That chair actually broke, that was not [laugh] fake.


KEITH: That was a breakable chair!


ALI: I-- I dont think.


KEITH: It was a chair made to break.


ALI: I don’t think they have weaker chairs.


KEITH: It’s wrestling.


ALI: No. But I saw like wrestling in real life and I thought that they had like easy to break like ladders and chairs and stuff.


AUSTIN: No, nope


ALI: But then I like heard what it sounds like when someone falls on a ladder.


[KEITH hums affirmative]


ALI: And those are real ladders.


KEITH: You know, I feel like a lot of that is-

AUSTIN: Here’s the thing like even stunt equipment is like rough. Like-


KEITH: Yeah, like sugar glass, yeah.


AUSTIN [overlapping KEITH]: Even like, taking like sugar glass like hurts. So.


AUSTIN: I hit someone with something once that hurt them, I don’t remember what is was.


[ALI huff-laughs, ART laughs, KEITH laughs]


JACK: A fish! Please be a fish! I really hope it was a fish.


AUSTIN: No, I don’t-- I don’t think it was a fish?


JACK: A frozen fish could mess you up though.


AUSTIN: Yeah! I played Power Stone. Okay! Let’s go.


ART: Sorry that was my new graphics card.


AUSTIN: Oh nice!


ALI [overlapping AUSTIN and KEITH]: Oh! Good!


KEITH [overlapping ALI and AUSTIN]: Nice!


AUSTIN [overlapping KEITH and ALI]: That’s good. That’s a good thing. 


KEITH: Yeah. So I was like looking-


ART [overlapping KEITH]: Now I just need the connecting tissue.


AUSTIN: What? Don’t use-- No? Don’t use tissue.


KEITH [overlapping AUSTIN]: No, this is not a cyborg.


AUSTIN [overlapping KEITH]: This is not a thing you should use. No.


ART: No, they’re sending some human skin to…


AUSTIN: No. No bad.


[ALI hums discontentedly]


ART: Go from the motherboard to the-


AUSTIN: No.


ART: Graphics card.


AUSTIN: Not good. Not good. Bad. Eject.


[ART ahhs in the background]


ALI: Is you computer just a man and that’s why it doesn’t work?


[AUSTIN laughs]


ART: Yeah, that’s not your computer is? Like a little guy-


AUSTIN: No. I don’t.


ART: You plug a little HDMI into and then be like, play some games.


AUSTIN: No, don’t-


KEITH: Oh you mean Erik.


AUSTIN [laughing]: Oh right.


[ALI laughs]


ART: Oh, I have a Steve but yeah.


AUSTIN: Well, that’s your problem there. Never get a Steve. The Steves are cheaper but never get a Steve.


ART [far away and plane noises]: Take that listeners named Steve.


ALI: Well, do you have one of the newer Steves?


AUSTIN: Steve had a long-


ART: I think this is a new Steve, like, he can barely walk.


ALI: The newer Steves are better than like the old Erik, but like, there’s gunna be a new Erik soon, like-


AUSTIN: Yeah, just go for the new Erik. 


[ALI laughs]


KEITH: Hold on one sec.


AUSTIN: I just think the-


ART [overlapping AUSTIN]: Erik’s really shitty about Updating though, so like-


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: If Erik wants my business, Erik can put out a new unit.


AUSTIN: This is an Erik with a K instead of a C?


ART: Yeah. 


ALI: God.


AUSTIN: We’re hilarious.
