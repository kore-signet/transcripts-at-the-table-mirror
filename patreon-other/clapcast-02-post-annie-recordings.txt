Clapcast 02: Post-Annie Recordings Transcribed by: Steph (@Downsnowing)


JACK: This is the first post-Annie recording, right?


JANINE (exasperated?): Yeah… I would be okay with having her in my room except she has a bell on her collar. Uhm -


[JACK laughs]


JANINE: Because we need to know where she is sometimes.


JACK: Yeah, that’s fair.


JANINE: So I don’t know that she’s gonna be a podcast adjacent cat. (chuckles)


[ALI laughs]


JACK: Unless we all just have a small bell on our desk that we agree to ring periodically.


ALI: Nope.


[JANINE chuckles]


JACK (chuckling): It all just blends in.


AUSTIN: No, Ali? That’s bad?


ALI (overlapping): I will not do that. Mmm-mmm (negative).


JACK: You’re sure Ali? I don’t see why you would be anti-this, Ali. This is like we’ve invented a machine that’s the opposite of Griffin’s cough button.


[ALI laughs]


JACK (chuckling): It’s just a bell. I’ve got like a scented candle here that I can - 


[JACK proceeds to hit on his scented candle repeatedly]


ALI: That’s not a bell, but okay.


JANINE (overlapping): People don’t -- people don’t normally use scented candles as audio equipment, but I like that you’re thinking outside the box.


[Someone starts using random things on their desk to make noises into the microphone]


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN (with his mouth full): Okay


ALI: Thirty? Five?


AUSTIN: Thirty’s fine.


ALI: Okay


JACK: Kay. (pause) Oh wait, I’m not looking at time.is.


AUSTIN: Oh, well..


JACK: I’m good I’m good I’m good I’m good.

AUSTIN: Mmkay.


[Long pause followed by three very distinct claps]


ALI (amazed): Wow, wow what was that?

JANINE (overlapping): Wait, wait, wait...


JACK (overlapping, chuckling): What, what?


JANINE: I thought, weren’t we doing thirty five?


AUSTIN: No.


JACK: No?
 
JANINE: Oh.. I -- Why did I think that we were doing…?


AUSTIN: Ali said thirty five and I said thirty’s fine and -


[ALI laughs in background]


JANINE: Oh...


AUSTIN: Cause we had like fifteen seconds.


JANINE: Uh I didn’t clap at all.


AUSTIN: I thought we had a really -- I thought we had a super good clap and instead we did not.


[ALI laughs]


JACK: We actually had the bad one, yeah.


ALI: Let’s do top of the minute.


AUSTIN: The top of the minute.


JACK: Top of the minute?


JANINE: Okay.


JACK: Okay.


[Long pause followed by one single clap]


AUSTIN: That was good.


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: That was pretty good. I’m into it.


[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: Uhm… Alright.




[NEW CLIP]




AUSTIN: Uhm, before we continue, we need to time.is again cause I fucked up by recording when I was making Foley sounds.


JACK: How did you do that?


AUSTIN: I don’t wanna talk about it. We just need to time.is again, I don’t wanna talk about it.


[JACK and ALI laugh]


AUSTIN: You and everyone can keep recording. Everyone can keep recording. It’s fine, everything‘ll be fine.


JACK: Rupert is such a terrible bird that he actively broke one of our recordings.


[JACK laughs]


AUSTIN (laughing): He broke my recording.


JANINE: What Austin’s not telling us is that he recorded a voice macro for like his computer so, so that his computer thinks that whenever he makes a bird sound it’s time to like disconnect the microphone or whatever.


AUSTIN (recovering from laughter): Uh-huh. Uh, can we clap at twenty seconds, please?


JACK: Yup.


JANINE: Yeah.


2:30 AUSTIN: Sorry, Ali. This should be fine, it should be fine.


[Short pause followed by a spattering of claps]


JANINE: I clapped a little early.


AUSTIN (chuckling): Thanks.


[JANINE chuckles slightly]




[NEW CLIP]




AUSTIN: Get me a map.


JACK: Okay. I’m going to bring one up on my phone.


AUSTIN (overlapping, gleefully): Oh hi Annie. I just heard a cat.


[Spattering of laughter]


JACK (chuckling): Hey Annie.


JANINE (in background): Nope. Nope. She’s not… 


ALI (overlapping): I think that’s one of mine.


JACK (overlapping): I think… no?


AUSTIN (overlapping): Oh, is that - ?


JANINE: Wait, is she…?


[Rustling]


ALI: No, that’s definitely one of mine.


[JACK laughs]


AUSTIN: Okay. [Annie meows] Okay.


ALI: No, that’s Annie.


JANINE: Oh, it’s also, it’s also Annie.


[Everyone laughs]


JANINE (to Annie, laughing): Honey, no..


[ALI laughs, followed by JACK]


[Annie meows again]


JACK: Okay, I’m gunna…


[JANINE laughs] 


JACK (laughing): Are you back Janine?


JANINE (chuckling): No, one second.


[ALI laughs]


JANINE: She’s up under the…


AUSTIN: Aww Annie.


[Pause]


JACK: This is Annie, you can find her on Twitter at…

[Spattered laughter]


AUSTIN: Welcome to FatT.


SYLVIA: Say goodbye to the Veil, it’s all Fiasco now too.


[Everyone laughs]


SYLVIA (unapologetically): Sorry.


AUSTIN (overlapping a bit): Alright, fuck, Alright, let’s clap at, um, forty five? Give us some time to work out some feelings?

DRE (in Borat voice): I’m playing da battlegrounds. Very nice.


AUSTIN (overlapping, laughing): Nope. Oh no.


ALI: Whew.

AUSTIN: Borat theme. Loop. [Borat Theme continues for two more seconds] That’s music that I played two seconds of. These are bad. Borat’s bad.
DRE: Wait. Is there a Borat theme? Like a -- like an iconic theme song to Borat?


ALI: Don’t think so.


BORAT (from video): Should I tell people that I am a-good at sex?

AUSTIN: Yeah, well


[DRE laughing]


AUSTIN: Not all of us can have exact time, Keith.


KEITH: Sorry. Hey, I mean everybody could have exact time if they worked hard.
