First segment [00:00:00]
Jack: It's fucking brilliant. [cross] I mean, god…
Dre: [cross] Yeah.
Keith: [cross] It was wild. It was wild! As it was happening it was just like: I can't believe that we're doing this!
Sylvi: I… Yeah, no. Real poggers moment on Friends at the Table.
Keith: Yeah. We were all saying that, too.
Sylvi: And then also… I mean, you know, I might have typed it in the Roll20 chat. [cross] Or something along those lines.
Keith: [cross] You did. You really… I thought I remembered you saying it.
Sylvi: [cross] I definitely said pog moment somewhere.
Keith: [cross] Literally saying it.
Sylvi: I might have! I might have. You know!
Jack: There’s a real… [cross] you know. I mean…
Sylvi: [cross] I'm annoying like that. [chuckles]
Jack: Poggers.
Keith: Can I tell you, I don't know what that means.
Sylvi: It just means good. It's just gamer for good.
Keith: Okay.
Jack: Have I told you about [cross] the dream that I had?
Dre: [cross] Wait.
Sylvi: [cross] I’m gonna start recording.
Jack: [cross] The poggers dream that I had?
Keith: No.
Sylvi: [half-giggling] Tell me about your poggers dream, Jack!
Jack: [laughs] I had a dream few months ago, maybe a year ago now, in which… Kat and I were talking to an extremely old man who was telling us about how in his youth, he used to make cookies in this really elaborate way. And he did… he walked through every step. It took this old man ages to make cookies in the olden days. And then the dream just hard cut to Kat opening a packet of pre-made cookie dough, portioning it, putting it into the oven and saying “poggers”...
[others laugh]
Jack: … and I laughed so hard that I woke myself up!
Keith: [laughs] That's bizarre.
Jack: That was my… That was my poggers dream.
Sylvi: That's great!
Keith: Yeah.
Jack: Yeah.
Keith: Uh, Dre were you gonna say something? About poggers?
Dre: I just, I'm shocked that you… That you didn't know what it meant!
Keith: I know that people say it and it seems like they say it when something is good. But I don't know, like, why [cross] or exactly what it's meant to mean.
Sylvi: [cross] So… Do you have… Are you aware of what the PogChamp is? The face.
Keith: That's that face of the guy who died…?
Dre: The guy that… [cross] No.
Sylvi: [cross] He didn't die, but he…
Keith: [cross] Oh, was racist?
Dre: [cross] Unfortunately, he's still alive. Yes.
Sylvi: [cross] Yes. He died socially! [laughs]
Keith: He either died or was racist.
Sylvi: This is great ‘cause I have friends who say that someone is canceled when they die! [laughs] So… [chuckles]
Dre: That's great.
Sylvi: Um… [cross] Like, instead of saying they died, they got canceled.
Keith: [cross] He, like, made that face during a video game tournament, and now he’s on twitch. Yeah.
Sylvi: [cross] He made… Yeah. He was, like, a fighting game guy and he made the face and it was very funny, and it became a twitch emote. And then he was racist. So they got rid of it. But people still make that face. And people… the, like, term poggers had already [cross] taken root as like a twitch… chat shorthand for, like, “sick”.
Dre: [cross] God, Keith, have you not seen for like funniest press releases of all time, when Twitch talked about how it’s important for them to keep the spirit of PogChamp alive in the community?
Sylvi: [cross] Yeah. No. That is literally what I think the first time…
Keith: [cross] No. No-no-no. I definitely have seen that. I just didn't…
Dre: [cross] Okay. Yeah.
Keith: [cross] It just didn't mean anything to me. [chuckles] Just doesn't… Like, I just didn't know what…
Sylvi: It's Zoomer for “epic”. [cross] You know?
Keith: [cross] Yeah.
Dre: [cross] Yea-yea-yeah.
Keith: [cross] I knew that that was the face… I knew that that was the face and that's what it was called. But it doesn't… That face doesn't say anything to me? It just is a goofy face, so.
Sylvi: He's going like: “oooh!”
Keith: Yeah.
Sylvi: You know?
Keith: It doesn't even seem like that positive of a face. Like, it looks…
Sylvi: No! It's — I don't know. [cross] Yeah.
Keith: [cross] It kind of reminds me of the… Who's the WWE guy?
Sylvi: [half-chuckling] Oh, you gotta be more specific!
Keith: The main one.
Dre: Yeah.
Keith: The guy who owns it.
Sylvi: Oh, Vince! [cross] Vince McMahon
Dre: [cross] Vince McMahon? Oh.
Keith: [cross] Yeah. Vince McMachon. Yeah. You know the meme of him, like, getting increasingly excited?
Sylvi: Yeah.
Keith: It just looks like one of those faces.
Sylvi: It kinda is!
Keith: Yeah. Yeah.
Sylvi: People use them similarly.
Keith: Okay. Um.
[pause]
Sylvi: I'm glad we did some etymology before getting into… [chuckles]
Keith: Yeah. ‘Cause something, I'll… I'll see something online that's annoying and I'll just go, I'll just register it as annoying and then not look into it.
Sylvi: [cross] Yeah. Fair enough. I do that all the time.
Keith: [cross] I'll be like “I remember that from that thing that annoyed me”.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Keith: [half-chuckling] And then I go away from there.
Jack: [cross] What is this one you say…
Sylvi: [cross] No, this is why it took me forever to listen to Snowing. And now I really like Snowing.
Dre: [cross] Hmm…
Jack: [cross] What is Snowing?
Sylvi: [cross] But they used… I used to associate them with people that annoyed me. It's an emo band.
Jack: Oh, it’s an emo band.
Dre: Mm-hm.
Sylvi: It’s a really good emo band. [chuckles]
Keith: [cross] Why did they…
Jack: [cross] [half-chuckling] Oh, really?
Keith: Why did their fans annoy you?
Sylvi: I just knew a guy. [cross] You know?
Keith: [cross] Okay. You… One. That’s all it takes, is one?
Sylvi: [cross] It's all it takes when I'm like when I’m, like…
Dre: [cross] Yeah. No. Yeah.
Sylvi: [cross] When I was like 19 years old, you know?
Keith: [cross] Sure.
Sylvi: [cross] Just knowing one guy who's annoying about a thing?
Keith: Yeah.
Dre: Yeah! Nah, it sounds right!
Jack: I've recently gotten really into Steely Dan and if there's one thing I knew about Steely Dan before getting really into it it's that people who like Steely Dan are deeply annoying.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Jack: So I'm… I'm in, like, a constant… I'm trying very hard not to be the guy.
Dre: [cross] Hmmm…
Keith: [cross] Oh, it's going to be really rough when you realize that you also like Phish.
Jack: [laughs] I don't think I…! The only thing I know about Phish is that their fans are also really annoying.
Keith: Yeah. Yeah.
Dre: Yeah.
Jack: I think that… I don't know. [cross] I think that Steely Dan…
Sylvi: [cross] It goes with the Nike stuff.
Jack: … probably were also really annoying.
Sylvi: [whispering] No, that was Grateful Dead.
Jack: It's the band as well as the fans. Is Phish also annoying? The Grateful Dead also seem to be really annoying.
Sylvi: [cross] Yeah…
Jack: [cross] But their music’s alright.
Keith: The… So, as… In high school, I really liked both the Grateful Dead and Phish. Um. And… I always found that the people who also liked the Grateful Dead were kind of nice but also kind of idiots. But the people that liked Phish were really annoying but also kind of idiots. [chuckles]
Sylvi: [cross] Mmm!
Jack: [cross] I would be really happy to be really nice but also kind of an idiot.
Keith: [cross] Yeah.
Jack: [cross] I think that… [chuckles] I think I would sit comfortably in that zone.
Keith: [cross] Some really good… There's a Grateful Dead song that is sort of like a jaunty little sort of Western-y guitar tune where the main character is just begging some gambling man to not murder him? In a…
Jack: Hm!
Keith: In a sort of very, like, nonchalant almost friendly way? It's, like, one of the best songs anyone's ever made.
Jack: [laughs]
Keith: It's so funny, to me! [laughs] Because, like, this guy’s like: [sings] “don't murder me!”
[others laugh]
Keith: Really funny.
Jack: This is Hazard and Uno Riscano from Sangfielle. [cross] Except… swapped with each other.
Sylvi: [cross] Oh my god! I've been thinking about them a lot today.
Keith: [coughs] Let me get these…
Dre: [cross] Oh, I should turn Audacity on.
Sylvi: [cross] I’m recording already, so.
Keith: Oh, yeah.
Dre: Austin not joining us?
Keith: No.
Sylvi: [cross] That’s next week.
Keith: [cross] Austin is gonna be for next week when…
Dre: Okay.
Keith: … we do the cup thing — [cross] which was his screenshot for the screenshot thing.
Jack: [cross, away from mic] I keep hearing about that!
Sylvi: [cross] Mm-hm.
Dre: [cross] Mmm!
Jack: I don't want to burn ‘cast, but we'll talk about that. [chuckles]
Keith: We'll talk about the cups?
Jack: Yeah, probably. 
Keith: In this one?
Dre: [humming “Cups” from Pitch Perfect] “And I’m waiting for the long way ‘round”!
Keith: [cross] Okay.
Jack: [cross] I mean, maybe.
Keith: Okay, okay.
Dre: Love Anna Kendrick’s…
[pause]
Keith: The actor?
Dre: Wow. Wow. Not a lot of… Pitch Perfect fans [cross] out here. I see.
Sylvi: [cross] No. [giggles]
Jack: [cross] No, I have not seen Pitch Perfect. And every time I…
Keith: [cross] Yeah, me neither.
Dre: [cross] I haven’t, either.
Jack: [cross] Every time I think about it, and I don't think about it very often…
Sylvi: [cross] [half-chuckling] I fucking hate Pitch Perfect.
Jack: Oh, Sylvi! We gotta watch it.
Sylvi: It’s dreadful! [cross] It… Ughh!
Dre: [cross] Media Plus 2! It's Pitch Perfect!
Sylvi: [cross] I’d rather die.
Keith: [cross] Did… Did Elizabeth Banks do just the second Pitch Perfect or both Pitch Perfects? ‘Cause I… I know that…
Sylvi: [cross] I’m… only watch the first one and it was repugnant.
Jack: [laughs] Repugnant?!?
Sylvi: [cross] Yeah. That’s how I feel about it, genuinely.
Keith: [cross] People who are surprising… People who surprise me will talk about Pitch Perfect 2 very positively.
Dre: Oh, yeah! Sure.
Keith: Um. But I’ve never heard anyone say anything good about the first one.
Jack: Elizabeth Banks is the kind of weirdo Scientologist who's nevertheless really good in The Invisible Man, right? [cross] Or I might think of someone else?
Keith: [cross] Oh… I would be surprised.
Dre: She’s…
Keith: Elizabeth Banks is like a comedy person, so I'd be surprised if she was a Scientologist. But she did the recent Cocaine Bear movie.
Dre: Was she in Power Rangers? The new movie?
Keith: No, no.
Sylvi: Um
Keith: No. She was in The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Zach and Mary Make a Porno. And was in 30 Rock a bunch?
Jack: I'm thinking of Elizabeth Moss.
Sylvi: He was in the new Power Rangers movie, Dre!
Dre: [cross] Yeah!
Keith: [cross] God, Elizabeth Moss!
Dre: [cross] Yeah, she’s Rita, right?
Keith: The One That I Love was the movie that Elizabeth Moss was in with… one of the mumblecore brothers — whose names I'm forgetting?
Sylvi: The Safdies?
Keith: No. No, the lower-key ones.
Sylvi: I don't… [cross] know…
Keith: [cross] The one that was in The League.
Sylvi: I didn't watch that.
Keith: Um… [whispers] Fuck.
Sylvi: I'm sorry.
Keith: Uh… He's like… Oh! Duplass! Mark Duplass.
Sylvi: Ahh!
Jack: Cool! I love those guys!
Keith: Elizabeth… Elizabeth Moss and Mark Duplass were in a movie called The One I Love. It's a bizarre — surprisingly kind of sci-fi — movie. Oh, wow! What a surprise when I watched that! What…! That is like one of those movies that I didn't know anything going into it and I came out of it being very happy that I didn't know anything going into it. [cross] What a phenomenal movie.
Jack: [cross] [half-chuckling] I think I know the movie you're talking about! God. Sylvi, have you seen Creep?
Sylvi: Uh, yeah! Yeah. I've seen Creep. Creep is great.
Jack: [cross] Creep is great!
Sylvi: I haven't seen Creep 2.
Jack: Creep 2 is also great. And they're planning on making a third one, but — and I find this really… I don't know, this is really endearing to me, for some reason — in all the interviews they’re like: “Yeah. It's really hard to make and we don't really know how to do it.”
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Jack: “So it's going to be a while.”
Keith: There's some… I'll say, troubling… troublingly unexamined events/themes in The One I Love… but I think everyone here would probably really like it if you haven't seen it. Probably.
Jack: I'm gonna add it to my Letterboxd.
Keith: Um. Yeah. Really good… Mark Duplass: complicated — seems like an annoying and frustrating guy — but I do like a lot of his work.
Jack: I'm inventing a new type of guy which is a guy who says I'm going to add it to my Letterboxd…
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Jack: … and then he adds it as though he's watched it and rates the movie immediately.
Dre: [laughs]
Keith: [laughs]
Sylvi: Fucking me in film school.
Keith: [cross] “That’s a 5!”
Jack: [cross] “Yeah, I saw that.” That was me doing English literature. God. [half-chuckling] The amount of books that I have read that I haven't read is too many books.
Keith: Wow!
Dre: Man! [cross] Yeah.
Keith: [cross] That's… That's a lot. Um… I just have endless stacks of unread books — that's how I handle that.
[jingle plays]
Second segment [00:10:12]
Ali: Keith, are you here?
[pause]
Janine: Mm.
Dre: Oh no! What do you need Keith for so bad? [chuckles]
Ali: Well, I got that pink aeropress… I'm a little ashamed for buying it just because it was pink, [cross] but the color is so beautiful in person that now I feel…
Janine: [cross] Do they have a pink one?
Ali: … extremely justified. Yeah. They, like, released it for Valentine's Day, apparently? Um… And it's this nice, like… Let me find out.
Janine: Oh, I see!
Ali: Mm-hm.
Janine: That's okay.
Ali: And in person it's, like, more of like a berry color? [cross] It's, like, very pretty.
Janine: [cross] Oooh!
Ali: So I feel very happy that I bought it.
Janine: [cross] Well, that's good.
Ali: [cross] But…
Janine: How’ve you liked it so far?
Ali: I haven't used it because I've been sick…
Janine: [cross] [sympathetically] Oh. Yeah.
Ali: [cross] …and feel weird about drinking coffee while I'm sick. And I don't really know why. But… I don't know. Maybe the caffeine is bad. Um…
Janine: Eh. Um….
Ali: I don't think that's true, but whatever.
Janine: No.
Ali: I think, like, milk is bad when you… [cross] have a sinus thing?
Janine: [cross] I think a lot of that stuff's in your head. I mean, milk will make you a little bit phlegmier than, like, water or something, I guess?
Ali: Mm.
Janine: But I…
Ali: [cross] Like, say, eating cheese.
Janine: [cross] I also feel like that's just kind of…
Ali: [chuckles] Yeah!
Janine: Yeah.
Dre: Yeah.
Ali: Uh, um…
Janine: I think the important thing is as long as you're staying hydrated and feeding yourself, it’s whatever.
Ali: Yeah. Um. But yeah. When I first started getting into the coffee stuff, Keith was like: “you should buy an aeropress!” And I was like: “Nooo! [chuckles] I'm not going to!”
Janine: But aeropress is good!
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: Aeropress is like: One, really fast.
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: Two, does not take up as much space as, like, a machine.
Ali: [cross] Mmm.
Janine: [cross] Three, is cheaper than a machine. Like… If you want to dip your toes in Aeropress is better than even getting, like, a nice pour over or something. Um.
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: [cross] Keith was right.
Ali: [cross] Yeah, I've been using a french press… Keith was right.
Janine: [cross] French press is also nice.
Ali: Um…
Janine: Or, like, a little moka pot? Moka pots are cute.
Ali: I do really… I've been in a weird place! [laughs]
Janine: [cross] Yeah?
Ali: [cross] I've been, like, looking at… I've been looking at, like, eBay, and old Etsy stuff for old — that's how I've been getting my coffee stuff just to get it super cheap —
Janine: Uhum.
Ali: … to look for moka pots. And then I was like: “I'm going to California soon. What if I…” And I was, like, weirdly excited about having access to a different Craigslist [chuckles] when I went to California…
Janine: [laughs]
Dre: [chuckles]
Ali: [chuckling] … check it out while I was there. And then I was like: “what if I went to a thrift store in California I found a really nice moka pot?” And then I was like… I was, like, vaguely thinking about going to Italy with my parents, as, like, a family trip. And I was like: “What if I went to Italy and I went to a thrift store and I found a moka pot?” [laughs] That I like…
Janine: [cross] Ohhh… Honey…
Ali: [cross] [chuckling] “Just go fucking buy something! What is wrong with you?” [laughs]
Sylvi: [laughs]
Janine: You're really… I love how you’re like constructing a story…
Dre: [cross] Uhum.
Janine: [cross] … because you want to have, like…
Ali: [laughs]
Janine: You want to… No, this makes sense though! This…! Okay. You're… acting like it’s stupid. But it makes sense.
Ali: [chuckles]
Janine: Because… like, when you have an attachment like that to something you get extra joy from bringing it out and using it.
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: So you have an extra incentive to make it a part of your routine.
Ali: Mm-hm.
Janine: So what it feels like here is there's this sort of underlying sense of like: “maybe I'm wasting my time with this thing.” So you wanna get something that you're extra attached to, that you feel extra special about.
Ali: [chuckles] [cross] Yeah…
Janine: [cross] Which is completely rational and reasonable! But also you should just buy a moka pot. [chuckles]
Ali: I really should just.. [laughs]
Janine: [cross] I guess you could find a nice vintage one.
Ali: [cross] Or I could use the aeropress that I just bought. Yeah.
Janine: Yeah. I mean, that's the thing is it kind of depends on… moka pot, I want to say, you can use for, like, espresso and stuff. Maybe I'm wrong.
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: Aeropress is more for, like, ground coffee.
Ali: Yeah, yeah. Well, so I was talking to Keith about this and I… he had said this thing that was like: “if I could only have two coffee makers, I would have, like, the aeropress and one of my pour over situations.”
Janine: Uhum.
Ali: And I was like: “wow if I could only have two coffee makers, what would I have?” And then I was like: “oh, I haven't used the aeropress yet, so I would compare that to the French press that I have.” And then probably…
Janine: Oooohh!
Ali: … a moka pot. ‘Cause I'd like to eventually do espresso. Um. [cross] So, yeah.
Janine: [cross] I just found someth… I'm going to put this in dogpound.
Ali: [laughs]
Sylvi: [cross] Ohhh…?
Janine: [cross] I just found something very silly funny. Very silly funny cool.
Ali: I love silly… silly funny cool.
Sylvi: Those are all great adjectives.
Dre: Yeah.
Sylvi: Oh. Huh?
Janine: I'm going to also just copy the image in here. [cross] ‘Cause it didn’t clip it for some reason.
Ali: [cross] I know! These are so cute! [laughs]
Dre: [cross] Ohhh!
Ali: [cross] [chuckles] I showed one of these to Keith and he was like: “they make a fucking mess. Don't have this. You would hate this.”
Sylvi: [chuckles]
Janine: [cross] But it’s so cute!
Ali: [cross] “It gets so hot. And it’s so stupid.”
Dre: [cross] But the aesthetic!
Ali: Let me show you the one that I really liked. That I… That he was like: “you're fucking stupid.”
Dre: [laughs] Aw!
Janine: [laughs]
Sylvi: Damn!
Janine: Wow.
Ali: This is…
Sylvi: [cross] Brutal!
Dre: [cross] So wait, how does this work?
Ali: You put water into the thing on the bottom and then…
Dre: Uh-huh.
Ali: Like, above it there's… another chamber [cross] where you have the coffee ground in.
Dre: [cross] I see. Like a little puck chamber. Okay. Yeah.
Ali: [cross] Yeah. And then the… When the water gets hot it pushes up, and then it…
Dre: Ohhh! Does it make, like, a vacuum or something?
Ali: I guess so? Um. That's the one that I wanted.
Dre: Oh, that's adorable!
Ali: Well, um…
Janine: Ah.
Ali: [cross] But yeah.
Janine: [cross] I don’t like the plastic there.
Ali: Is it plastic?
Janine: Is that plastic? [cross] It looks like plastic.
Dre: [cross] It looks plastic.
Ali: It feels like it's just like a painted enamel. That's what that looks like I guess.
Dre: [cross] I can see that. I can see that.
Janine: I can see why you wanted to get one of these in Italy because I'm seeing on Etsy a lot of, like, vintage Italian ones where the top part is, like, a little ceramic teapot?
Ali: Uh-huh.
Janine: It's so cute.
Ali: Uh-huh. Uh-huh, uh-huh! Yup. And then the shipping is, like, $40 or whatever [half-chuckling] [cross] and instead of just paying that I was like…
Janine: [cross] Yeah…
Ali: [chuckling] “You know, let me just fly there and spend thousands of dollars…” [laughs]
Dre: Hm.
Janine: [skeptically] Hmmm…
Dre: I'm feeling so less embarrassed about explaining to people that I'm basically visiting Michigan to buy cheaper weed — [cross] now that Ali's like “I want to fly to Italy to buy a coffee maker.” [laughs]
Ali: [cross] Oh!
[pause]
Janine: Ooooohh! Turkish coffee pot! That's very pretty.
Ali: Yeah.
Dre: Ooh!
Ali: There are… If I was going to… just buy one today. If I had… if I was forced to.
Dre: Oh, these are beautiful, Janine! Holy crap!
Janine: Right?
Ali: [cross] There's this whole…
Janine: [cross] I think this is the one you pour in the sand or some…
Ali: [chuckles]
Janine: Or, like, you put it in the sand then it boils and then you pour it.
Ali: There's this whole Pantone collection of them.
Dre: [cross] Oooohhh!
Ali: [cross] Which you can find these for, like, 10 bucks on eBay. And some of them have a little set where you can have, like, a cup with it, too.
Janine: Aww…
Ali: And I think that's… that's what I would go for. But I'm also really into thrifting now because I want to get a Dutch oven… [cross] instead of spending like $300 on one.
Janine: [cross] Yeah.
Dre: Yeah.
Ali: Just go find one.
Janine: Having a good thrift store is really… is so good. I don't love the thrift store locally, but whenever I visit Jack and KB…
Ali: Mm-hm…!
Janine: Or at least when I have in the past — we've gone once and then last time I was visiting them it was closed. ‘Cause it was back to regular non-holiday hours, which sucked. But there's a thrift store there that I know Jack has talked about on the podcast and stuff. But it's like a thrift store… that the proceeds go to, like, local schools and stuff, teachers, and things like that.
Ali: Mmm.
Dre: [cross] Mmm!
Janine: [cross] And… that store is so fucking good! Like, they have two… two stores side by side, one of them is like where they put all the good stuff. [chuckles]
Ali: [laughs]
Janine:  And the other one is where everything else goes. But they're both good. Like, the one where everything else goes has like a bunch of craft supplies and stuff? So you can get, like, stamps that you would pay $8 for at Michael's at the very least, for, like, 70 cents. Um.
Ali: Yeah.
Janine: And in the good stuff shop, stuff is still pretty cheap but, like… you know, I want to say KB just, like, straight up found Le Creuset in there. [chuckles]
Dre: Wow. Is that in California or in Ann Arbor?
Janine: Ann Arbor.
Dre: Oh, what's it called?
Janine: Uh, PTO.
Dre: [cross] Okay.
Ali: [cross] I have to go visit them. I've, like… I've never been a thrifting person. Um…
Sylvi: Mm-hm.
Ali: But I'm starting to feel this sort of like…
Janine: You should definitely visit them, then.
Austin: Hello.
Janine: Because that thrift store rules.
Ali: [chuckles] The… I feel the sort of, like, grief over the… change of the business? Um… I think it was, like, during COVID, or maybe just Tik Tok, Instagram stuff, where like it's become… a thing of third party sellers?
Sylvi: Yeah.
Dre: [cross] Mmm.
Janine: [cross] Yeah.
Ali: [cross] To the point where, like, even Goodwill now has an online store where you can…
Sylvi: It sucks.
Janine: Yeah.
Ali: Uh…
Janine: I mean, the thing… The thing that happened is a bunch of people bought into dropshipping e-courses…
Sylvi: [cross] [sighs]
Janine: [cross] … and then realized the market was not a thing where you could make money and then they were like: “uh, okay. How do we find other venues for this?”
Ali: Hm.
Austin: [groans in commiseration]
Janine: And then it became, like… you know, people dropshipping on Etsy but saying the thing is, like…
Austin: [cross] Yeah…
Janine: [cross] “handmade!” “Vintage!”
Dre: [cross] Mm-hm.
Austin: Yeah. The fact that Etsy is now completely fucking overrun with dropshippers is, like… heartbreaking to me… 
Dre: [cross] It is so bad, dude.
Janine: [cross] You can still kind of find stuff.
Austin: You can, but… [cross] It’s a… Yeah. You gotta…
Janine: [cross] But, like, I tend to… I tend to filter price, like, high to low.
Austin: [cross] Yeah.
Dre: [cross] Yeah.
Janine: [cross] Is the way to find most stuff there now that's actually made by a person.
Austin: [cross] And you can, like, dig into someone’s shop to be like: “hey, is this real?” Like: “is this really a person who has a shop with…” Yeah.
Janine: [cross] Yeah. Is this the thing they do or is this just a stock photo that's a front for, like, a factory in Vietnam.
Austin: [cross] Yeah. Yeah.
Janine: [cross] At best.
Ali: Yeah. It also depends on what you're looking for. I had… I was looking for frames on Etsy recently…
Austin: [cross] Hmm…
Ali: [cross] They were all, like, from the '90s or whatever.
Austin: [cross] Interesting. Right, right, right-right.
Janine: [cross] Hmm!
Dre: [cross] Hm.
Ali: [cross] But… You know, it's hard to say that that's vintage. But at least it was not, like, bullshit.
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: Um. But yeah.
Austin: Is Keith back? I think Keith's the only voice I can’t…
Ali: [cross] Oh, hi, Keith!
Austin: [cross] Okay. Perfect. And Sylvi’s here?
Sylvi: Yep!
Austin: Yeah. Okay, we're back. Let's do a 3-2-1 clap?
Ali: Yeah.
Austin: 3, 2, 1.

Third segment [00:20:36]
Dre: Oh boy!
Keith: Hello!
Sylvi: Uh-huh. [cross] Hello!
Dre: [cross] The NFL is… The NFL is tweeting about how Pat McAfee is at the game right now.
Sylvi: Cool. Good for… Good for…
Art: What a week!
Dre: What a… Yeah. What a time to post… to link your brand to Pat McAfee.
Sylvi: What happ… [cross] Wait. What?
Keith: [cross] Who’s Pat McAfee?
Dre: Uh. Okay.
Art: Ohh…
Dre: So he's a former NFL player who for a while was hosting a… like, an unaffiliated sports show. I think at some point it got picked up by Barstool?
Sylvi: [cross] Yeah.
Art: [cross] Yeah…
Dre: [cross] But even if it didn't, he's very, like, Barstool-adjacent. Um…
Sylvi: And then ESPN picked him up, right?
Dre: Yes! ESPN paid him a record amount of money and then fired a bunch of, like, [cross] actually good and talented people?
Sylvi: [cross] Yes, it's why they fired, like, Bomani Jones and shit.
Dre: Yeah.
Art: Yeah.
Dre: A bunch of people! Like, a lot of people got fired.
Sylvi: Yeah.
Dre: Like, Suzy Kolber got fired! Um… But, anyway, he's best friends with Aaron Rogers so Aaron Rogers always comes on his show to talk, like, bullshit antivax stuff. Uh… But…
Art: This week to slander Jimmy Kimmel.
Dre: This week not just did… Not just any slander, but to basically say Jimmy Kimmel is in the Epstein logs!
Sylvi: Whoa!
Keith: Wow.
Art: [cross] Apparently, untrue.
Dre: [cross] Uh, and then after like people at ESPN were like: “that's not cool you can't do that”, he then went on TV and said there are people within ESPN who don't want the Pat McAfee show to be successful and specifically named, like, the second-in-charge person at ESPN. [chuckles] So…!
Sylvi: Nooo!
Dre: We'll see! [chuckles] We'll see how that goes!
Sylvi: [cross] That’s… Yeah.
Keith: [cross] And so now the NFL is, like, tweeting out that he's at their show? Or… “Their show”! [cross] He’s at a game?
Dre: [cross] He’s at a game? He’s at the Colts game.
Keith: [cross] Show, a little show?
Art: Yeah. He's like a former NFL player, too. He was a…
Dre: [cross] He was a punter-kicker.
Art: [cross] He was a punter who had a… reputation for, like, being a good tackler for a punter.
Sylvi: [cross] Oh, okay!
Art: [cross] He was, like, a punter who could get some.
Dre: Yeah.
Sylvi: I was… [chuckles]
Art: Well. [cross] Maybe not like that. [chuckles]
Sylvi: [cross] [half-chuckling] No, I know! I was going to say: “oh, he was a punter so he didn't really, like… The concussions aren't really an excuse.” But I guess maybe not.
Dre: No, he probably has those.
Sylvi: Yeah. He seems like… I mean, he wrestled so he definitely does.
Dre: [cross] Yeah.
Art: [cross] Yeah.
Dre: That's the other thing [cross] is he’s a…
Art: [cross] Yeah, then he became a wrestling announcer, and then a wrestler… who's, like, good for not being a wrestler.
Keith: [cross] The classic wrestling announcer to wrestler pipeline.
Sylvi: You'd be surprised.
Art: Yeah.
Keith: [laughs]
Dre: Yeah. [cross] Yeah.
Sylvi: You genuinely would be surprised!
Art: Yeah.
Dre: [cross] There’s The Rock.
Art: [cross] There's some terrible Michael Cole matches out there.
[pause]
Sylvi: Um… [cross] Okay.
Art: [cross] But, like, WWE's had a way… a weird run of successfully converting non wrestlers into wrestlers. It's, like, Pat McAfee did a fine job as did Bad Bunny. And Logan…
Sylvi: Bad Bunny did more than a fine job! Bad Bunny did a… like… some pretty good wrestling!
Art: And Logan Paul is inexplicably pretty good at it, too.
Dre: That doesn't surprise me.
Sylvi: [cross] No…!
Keith: [cross] Well isn't he, like a… boxer or something?
Sylvi: In…
Art: Well…
Dre: Yeah.
Art: He did do boxing, but…
Dre: He's like an amateur boxer [cross] who desperately wants be professional.
Keith: [cross] Is he not boxing anymore?
Art: He doesn’t do boxing anymore — and also, I don't want to say that his fights were rigged, but he also exclusively fought tomato cans. [chuckles]
Dre: [cross] Oh, yeah.
Sylvi: [cross] Yeah, no. He was on that Floyd Mayweather… shit, like, immediately.
Art: [laughs]
Sylvi: [cross] Where he's like…
Dre: [cross] Yeah yeah yeah.
Sylvi: He's just fighting fucking, like, dudes that they found outside the stadium.
Dre: Or, like, other celebrities.
Sylvi: [cross] Oh, yeah, or influencers.
Dre: [cross] Or very washed up old boxers.
Art: [cross] Oh, yeah, totally washed up people!
Keith: [cross] Are they… Are they both doing that? Both of the Pauls were doing that?
Art: Yeah. [cross] I think Jake might still be doing it.
Sylvi: [cross] I think so.
Keith: [cross] Or one of them is fighting more legitimately? Okay.
Sylvi: And then Logan was like: “oh, I can get more money doing this other thing.”
Dre: Yeah.
Sylvi: Um…
Dre: I mean, the thing… [sighs] you never have to hand it to Logan Paul. But the thing about the boxing thing is it does seem like he took it very seriously — and just… [cross] you know.
Sylvi: [cross] Yeah.
Dre: He thought he was rich enough and cool enough that he could, like, train very hard at boxing for a year and be a real boxer. And no! So… But it doesn't surprise me that he is good at wrestling because I could totally see him being the type of dude who's like: “I'mma take this super fucking serious.”
Art: [cross] Uh-huh.
Sylvi: [cross] Yeah. I also Imagine a lot easier to do steroids within the WWE right now.
Dre: Oh, for sure. Yeah.
Art: And he gets working a crowd, right? Because that's his whole… [cross] life?
Dre: [cross] That's his whole shtick. Yeah.
Sylvi: Um… [cross] We should prob…
Art: [cross] Kevin Owens gave him a black eye last night, though.
Sylvi: [cross] Nice!
Dre: [cross] Good.
Sylvi: Love when… Love Kevin.
Dre: [cross] Yeah.
Sylvi: [cross] Unfortunate that I never going to watch another match of his ever again.
Dre: Zoo Enthusiast [cross] brings justice.
Sylvi: [cross] Could not… [sighs] I miss him, but I'm not watching that company.
Dre: Yeah. That's fair.
Sylvi: Do we want to get rolling with Act One?
Keith: [cross] Noo!
Sylvi: [cross] So we could… No?
Dre: [cross] [chuckles] No.
Sylvi: [cross] We want to just hang out?
