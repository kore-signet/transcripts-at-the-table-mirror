Transcriber: meko




KEITH: Hello.


AUSTIN: Hi. 


SYLVIA: Hey.


JANINE: Hey. 


DRE: [muffled] Hello.


KEITH: Sorry I’m late.


AUSTIN: [muffled] Mm-hm. 


[Sylvia laughs] 


KEITH: Sounds like we were busy eating. 


[Sylvia, Janine, and Austin laugh]


AUSTIN: [muffled] Mm-hm. 


[Keith sighs]


AUSTIN: Alright. Ready to time.is before we go on?


KEITH: Sure.


SYLVIA: Are we on Roll20 for this?


AUSTIN: Uh, yeah, Roll20. Just the Bluff City game. 


SYLVIA: Oh, okay...um, and I get this up...Okay, I’m ready. 


JANINE: Uhh—[laughs] 


AUSTIN: Okay? No rush.  


JANINE: Okay, it’s on top. I panicked, thinking it would be buried and it was [laughs] just literally the first thing on Roll20. 


AUSTIN: Mhm.


JANINE: It’s fine, I’m okay. 


AUSTIN: Okay. Ready to clap?


JANINE: Yes.


AUSTIN: Thirty?


JANINE: Yes. 


[pause, followed by claps]


AUSTIN: Okay. Move this file…


KEITH: It’s a little bit too chilly in my office but I know that as soon as we start recording it will, for no reason, get a little too hot in the office.


AUSTIN: Yeah. 


JANINE: Mhm. 


KEITH: So I’m resisting the urge to turn the heat up now.


AUSTIN: Yeahh. 


KEITH: Knowing that [laughs], for whatever reason, recording makes this room ninety degrees.


AUSTIN: Ugh. I’m gonna go live, by the way. I just went live, by the way [chuckles]. And now I’m gonna publish this…


JANINE: You should get some of that window plastic. 


AUSTIN: Yeah. 


KEITH: Window plastic?


JANINE: I’m excited to do that. I—it’s fucked up that I’m so excited to do that. 


KEITH: So wait, this is the thing where you put loose plastic over a window and then you hairdry it until it’s tight?


JANINE: Yeah.


KEITH: Yeah. I did that—I had to do that one time and it really was effective. It really worked. 


JANINE: It’s very effective. 


KEITH: But I feel like that would make this room even hotter. 


JANINE: Yeah.


KEITH: This is the hottest room in the whole house. With the exception of upstairs in the living room when the wood stove is on, is—that becomes the hottest room. But even when the heat is off, like it was—this morning it was fifty degrees in the rest of the house but it was like fifteen degrees hotter in the office. 


JANINE: You have one of those secret fires burning in the wall or something?


KEITH: I don’t know! It doesn’t even get direct sunlight; there’s one little window and there’s drapes covering it. I don’t know why it gets so hot in here. Maybe it’s just buried very well. 


JANINE: Maybe you have Borrowers. Maybe there’s like a little Borrower nest and they’ve got a wood stove of their very own.


KEITH: Aw. Very—


AUSTIN: Excuse me?


JANINE: Borrowers. 


KEITH: Borrowers.


AUSTIN: Which ones are those?


KEITH: They’re little people that live in the walls. And they borrow your things.


AUSTIN: They’re basically gnomes, right?


KEITH: No.


SYLVIA: No.


AUSTIN: No, they’re not gnomes. They’re tiny—


KEITH: Way smaller than gnomes, they’re like mouse-people. 


AUSTIN: Okay. 


JANINE: They’re delicate and conventionally attractive. 


AUSTIN: Unlike gnomes [snorts].


JANINE: Exactly.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: Gnomes aren’t conventionally attractive at all [laughs]. 


AUSTIN: Well, why do people—[sighs]


KEITH: Is part of Borrowers being conventionally attractive?


AUSTIN: Yeah, I think—


JANINE: I just feel like the depictions of them it’s always like “Look at this clear-skinned fifteen year-old girl.” Like that kind of thing.


AUSTIN: That’s just artists liking to draw conventionally attractive people, right?


JANINE: Ah, yeah. True. 


AUSTIN: Also wait, I just looked up the Borrowers and the image I got was this—


JANINE: Am I wrong? 


AUSTIN: Well... 


JANINE: Am I thinking of Arrietty? [laughing] Is that my problem?


AUSTIN: I just don’t know that this dude...is doing it for me. 


JANINE: Oh. Well, no, those are like par—the parents don’t count.


AUSTIN: What?!


JANINE: And also those are real people, and real people can only look a certain way. 


[Keith laughs, Janine snorts]


KEITH: Okay, there’s a lot of qualifications on this now all of a sudden. 


[Janine laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah. Did you mean The Brazen Borrower from Magic the Gathering? Probably not.


JANINE: Is Arrietty actually based on the Borrowers?


AUSTIN: Who?


JANINE: Or is it just based on something Borrower-adjacent? 


SYLVIA: It’s a—


JANINE: The Ghibli movie. 


SYLVIA: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Ohhh.


JANINE: “Arrietty, titled ‘The Borrower Arrietty’ in Japan and ‘The Secret World of Arrietty’ in North America.”


AUSTIN: I thought you were saying, like, Hairy-Eddie and that seemed like some sort of Canadian thing I didn’t know about. But Arrietty, sure. 


JANINE: Hairy-Eddie [laughs]. 


AUSTIN: Hairy-Eddie [laughs].


JANINE: He’s a puppet.


AUSTIN: Not Harry Yeti. 


KEITH: You’re talking—


JANINE: The puppet who curses at pop stars. 


AUSTIN: Yes. 


KEITH: You’re talking about Harry Yeti from Harry and the Hendersons. 


AUSTIN: And the Yetersons, yeah...Yes, Arrietty is based on the Borrowers by Mary Norton. [typing] 


JANINE: I wish I could use a clothespin as a hair tie. 


KEITH: I've never seen Harry and the Hendersons, but I do love John Lithgow. 


AUSTIN: He’s in that. 


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: I—I only realized in the last five years that that thing was a thing that existed. Because, in my childhood, I remembered some sort of really upsetting Bigfoot media that I was—that I would just remember sometimes [Sylvia chuckles] and it made me really uncomfortable. [laughs] I didn’t know if it was a movie or a show or what it was. And then that became kind of a tier four meme.


KEITH: Mhm.


JANINE: And I was like “Oh, okay, that did exist, and that’s why Sasquatch stuff creeps me out.”


KEITH: Because you had a vague awareness of Harry and the Hendersons when you were a child?


JANINE: Yeah, it’s not a good-looking Sasquatch. It’s like a really—I don’t know.


AUSTIN: You’re talking about Ha—the Harry in the Harry and the Hendersons. 


KEITH: You’re talking about Harry from Harry and the Hendersons. 


JANINE: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: What—wait, you’re saying that Harry from Harry and the Hendersons is a particularly—


KEITH: It’s a little bit of a creepy one, because he’s doing, like—he’s smiling.


JANINE: He does, like, provocative smirks too much and stuff like that. [laughs] I don’t like it.


AUSTIN: Provocative smirks?


SYLVIA: Ugh.


AUSTIN: I don’t like the phrasing, to be honest. 


JANINE: He just, like—he just, like—I don’t know, he just makes faces that I don’t like.


KEITH: Sad.


SYLVIA: Oh God. 


JANINE: He’s got a Jim Carrey quality. 


AUSTIN: Oh, he does! That is a Jim Carrey. 


JANINE: It’s the way that, like, Jim—he creeps me out in the exact same way that Jim Carrey in the Mask creeps me out. Where it’s just like—there’s, like, a gross threat here that I don't like. 


[Keith laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah...


SYLVIA: He’s doing the same thing Jim Carrey does, which is, like, he’s doing the Dreamworks face but he’s got so much prosthetic on that it warps his features more. 


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: Yeah. Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Oh, I found a GIF. 


SYLVIA: Oh no.


AUSTIN: That everyone should definitely watch. Let me copy this address for y’all and put this in our groupchat here...bop!


SYLVIA: Oh, that’s—


JANINE: Ugh, his lips are so wet too.  


AUSTIN: It’s not ani—oh, there it goes. Now it’s animated. 


SYLVIA: Ugh. 


JANINE: Oh, I don’t—[sighs]


AUSTIN: What’s up?


JANINE: ...Like it. 


SYLVIA: Oh, they’re polishing him. 


AUSTIN: Yeah! [Janine laughs] Getting Harry ready for a night on the town.


JANINE: They’re giving him a wax and a buff.


AUSTIN: Yeah!


KEITH: I can only—now can only assume, because this is a movie I haven’t seen, I can only assume that this is about a dare that someone couldn’t ask Harry of Harry and the Hendersons out to the prom and win Prom King. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, that’s right. That’s the final act. 


KEITH: That’s the final act?


AUSTIN: Yeah, definitely. What—


JANINE: Oh, I found—


KEITH: I found this out—


JANINE: Hang—


AUSTIN: Tell me what you know about Harry and the Hendersons. 


KEITH: Oh—so Harry’s a Bigfoot and everybody at high school says “Wow, there’s no way Harry could go to the prom and be Prom King.”


AUSTIN: Woah, time out. So you’re saying at the start of this movie—


KEITH: Uh-huh.


AUSTIN: Harry is established as—


KEITH High school student. 


AUSTIN: High school student Harry. 


KEITH: High school Harry. Harry Henderson. 


AUSTIN: Harry Henderson, yeah. 


KEITH: And the cool kid that Harry has a crush on says—


AUSTIN: What’s the cool kid’s—yeah, what’s the cool kid’s name? That Harry has a crush on. 


KEITH: John Lithgow.


[laughter]


AUSTIN: John Lithgow. Played by? 


ALI: Mm-hm.


KEITH: Played by John Lithgow. 


AUSTIN: Okay, cool. Right, right, right. 


KEITH: John Lithgow as himself—


AUSTIN: Also in high school. 


KEITH: All in high school. 


AUSTIN: A high school student.


KEITH: Says “I bet you all—”


AUSTIN: Not a Henderson. 


KEITH: No. 


AUSTIN: I just want to be a hundred percent clear. 


KEITH: No, not a Henderson [laughs].


AUSTIN: Yeah, just being clear.


KEITH: Harry and the Hendersons, the Hendersons are Harry’s family.


AUSTIN: Who are also Bigfeet? 


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Bigfoots?


KEITH: Bigsfoot.


AUSTIN: Bigsfoot.


KEITH: Um [laughs]. And so John Lithgow bets his friends “Hey, I bet I could ask Harry Henderson out to prom and still win Prom King.” 


AUSTIN: Right.


KEITH: And they said “Oh no.” And then—but along the way, John Lithgow—


AUSTIN: Wait, time out. Did they say “oh no” because they’re like “Oh no, that’s a rude thing to do.” Or are they—


KEITH: No, they say “oh no” because John Lithgow actually falls for Harry Henderson. 


AUSTIN: I see. I—realizes the heart of Harry.


KEITH: But then “oh no” again after John Lithgow has genuinely fallen for Harry Henderson—


AUSTIN: Right.


KEITH: Harry Henderson finds out that this was all just a bet.


AUSTIN: Right. Right. Which is really upsetting.


KEITH: Right. It—


AUSTIN: And dismissive of Harry 


KEITH: Yeah. And so John Lithgow has to overact his way into Harry Henderson falling back in love with him.


AUSTIN: Has to—has to—but is that not seen as being kinda shitty and gross too? Like, why—overacting doesn’t feel like—


KEITH: Well, it’s an 80s movie.


AUSTIN: Oh, okay. Right, right, right. This is one of the famous ones. It was like Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Harry and the Hendersons.


KEITH: Yeah. And so when you go back and you look at it, you’re like “This is kind of a little bit fucked up, but at the time—”


AUSTIN: “This is like racist in a weird way that I didn’t expect, I can’t really show this to my kids.”


KEITH: No, but—


AUSTIN: “Especially because we’re also Hendersons.”


KEITH: Right, yeah. “We’re the rest of the Hendersons.”


AUSTIN: Right. Thanks.


JANINE: I found a picture of Harry without the face in the face. Like, a mask without a person in it.


SYLVIA: Oh no.


AUSTIN: Mhm. 


JANINE: And a thing that I’ve learned from this mask is that I think—


SYLVIA: [yelps] Aah! 


JANINE: —they put lipgloss on the lips [laughs]. 


AUSTIN: I’m not gonna show this to the chat; they can find this themselves.


[Janine and Keith laugh]


AUSTIN: Hi chat! [Keith keeps laughing] I’m not. It’s too scary to me. 


KEITH: That is the true face.


JANINE: The lips look so bad that they must have glossed them manually.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Almost certainly.


SYLVIA: Ohhh.


KEITH: Is there a link in here to the Youtube?


AUSTIN: It is in the—oh, no there is not. That does not exist in here. Let me copy that and pop that. Right there.


KEITH: Thank you.


AUSTIN: Alright. I’m gonna take a sip of coffee. Mmm. 


KEITH: What kind of coffee you got?


AUSTIN: I got a flat white. 


JANINE: I like—


KEITH: I like a flat white! 


AUSTIN: I like a flat white.


KEITH: It was the hot thing for a minute— 


JANINE: It’s a pleasing coffee.


KEITH: What’s that, Janine?


AUSTIN: What’d you say?


JANINE: It’s a pleasing coffee.


KEITH: It is, yeah.


AUSTIN: It’s a pleasing coffee.


KEITH: I never had one while it was the new hot shit. And then I had one for the first time a couple months ago and I was like “I get it.”


AUSTIN: It’s good.


KEITH: I get why this was a fad for once.  


AUSTIN: A hot minute, yeah, totally. Alright, we should do a—


JANINE: It’s like what you want a cappuccino to be. Versus what a cappuccino actually is. 


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: I—


KEITH: [laughing] Which is just a wet latte. 


AUSTIN: Right, yeah. Mm-hm. Alright. Uh, ready to do this?


JANINE: Mm-hm.


SYLVIA: Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: Alright, get ready. By yawning [laughing]. 


KEITH: A small wet latte, which is the thing. You order a cappuccino, you’re like “Oh, this is way too much for what’s in this.” 


AUSTIN: It’s too much. Alright. 




[musical interlude, 10:56]




AUSTIN: [half-singing] Publish now…


KEITH: You said publish now to the theme—to the tune of the Mission Impossible theme.


AUSTIN: Did I?


KEITH: Yeah.  


SYLVIA: Yeah, a little bit.


AUSTIN: Huh. 


SYLVIA: [singing] Da-da-daa.


KEITH: You said [singing] “Publish nowww.” 


AUSTIN: Oh yeah, I guess I did [laughing]. Okay, yeah sure. Wait for some people to filter in... 


ART: You hear they’re shooting those back-to-back?


AUSTIN: Are there more of those coming?


ART: They’re gonna do two more Mission Impossibles shot back-to-back. 


KEITH: Wow. 


AUSTIN: Hmm.


KEITH: How many Mission Impossibles can you make where at the end they do it where you’re like “I don’t know if these people are working on an accurate scale of what’s impossible.”


ART: That’s the name of the people they work for. It’s not a difficulty.


KEITH: Oh, right. I forgot; that’s so weird.


ART: Yeah, they work for the Impossible Mission Force.


[Sylvia laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah, the IMF


ART: The IMF.


KEITH: Right. Which doesn't have any other acronyms—


AUSTIN: No.


KEITH: For any other sort of thing.


AUSTIN: Nope.


ART: I wonder what came first. 


AUSTIN: That’s—I’m looking into that exact thing right now. 


KEITH: I have a really, really good idea of which one came first, but—


AUSTIN: Yeah, it was the IMF.


KEITH: Yeah.


ART: They’re both IMF [laughs].


AUSTIN: Yeah.


KEITH: The real one that exists.


AUSTIN: Wink.


[Keith laughs]


ART: Yeah, I’m not any closer to figuring this out. 


AUSTIN: It’s the International Monetary Fund. By like twenty years, twenty-two years.


ART: Wow.


KEITH: They don’t just make up—those three letter organizations just don’t pop up overnight. I mean, they do, but—


AUSTIN: I mean—


KEITH: They all popped up overnight a lot of years ago. 


AUSTIN: Um. I guess we—if you had asked us to actually figure that out, we absolutely would have figured it out. Right?


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Because we would have put together that the International Monetary Fund was, like, extremely part of postwar project—it was the postwar stabilization project, right?


KEITH: Mm-hm. 


ART: I don’t know, you could’ve convinced me it was a Cold War thing.


AUSTIN: Mhm. Mm-hm. Yeah. 


ART: And then we might—then we’re competing with Mission Impossible, a piece of Cold War fiction. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, totally. Um, that makes sense.


KEITH: Sorry, I need to say “ba ba ba” one more time. [clears throat] Ba ba ba.


AUSTIN: [singing] Barbara Ann. 


KEITH: I was slightly quiet, and now I think I’m good.


AUSTIN: I think we’re good. People are here.


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: People are hanging out. Got some viewers in the chat. 


KEITH: What’re you eating?


AUSTIN: I had some beef jerky, but I’m done with it now. I’m not done with it, I have it in a bag and I will return to it at some point in the future.


KEITH: I’ve washed my hands of beef jerky. 


AUSTIN: Oh, nice.


KEITH: I’m done with it. 


AUSTIN: Nice. Good for you. 


KEITH: No, no, I haven’t.


AUSTIN: Oh.


KEITH: It’s just another version—way of saying—


AUSTIN: Oh, what I—I see what you’re saying. I’m done with beef jerky [scoffs]. 


KEITH: I had beef jerky the other day as a pre—I realized I hadn’t—you ever go like “Oh, I haven’t eaten anything today.” 


AUSTIN: Yes.


KEITH: “And I’m about to have to record into a microphone.”


AUSTIN: Yeah.


KEITH: Um—


AUSTIN: Keith? You’re describing today. For me. You’re describing why I was eating some beef jerky on my way home. 


KEITH: Yeah, I bought—I was on my way to the Nightmare Barn where we were gonna record the last episodes of our Silent Hill 4 Let’s Play for Runbutton. And I passed a gas station; I was like “Last chance, gotta get some beef jerky.” Um, so I eat beef jerky while setting up. So it sounds exactly like what you’re doing.


AUSTIN: Mhm.


KEITH: And Red Bull, I had a Red Bull.


AUSTIN: I did not—I am drinking a coffee drink though, so. 


KEITH: Yeah. Same principle.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


KEITH: Coffee drinks make me jittery and anxious.


AUSTIN: Ah.


ART: Oh that’s—that’s usually that’s what I’m going for on a recording.


AUSTIN: Jittery and anxious?


ART: Jittery and anxious.


AUSTIN: It comes through; you got it. Yeah, you nailed it. 


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: I’m bringing you up a little bit. 


SYLVIA: Usually my baseline, so.


[Austin chuckles] 


AUSTIN: I’m gonna sneeze, one second [sneezes].


KEITH: Alright. Actually, I should say more jittery and anxious. 


[Sylvia chuckles]


[Austin sneezes]


AUSTIN: Okay. Are y’all ready to do a podcast?


ART: Well, I didn’t have any coffee, so I’m not nearly jittery or anxious enough.


AUSTIN: Okay. Well, you want me to pause while you put on a pot?


ART: No, that’s gonna take too long.


KEITH: I have some matcha.


AUSTIN: Ooh, matcha. 


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Happy, uh, Mole Day everyone. 


KEITH: Mole—Mole Day?


AUSTIN: It’s what time.is says. Time.is says it’s Mole Day.


KEITH: Are you—is it Vole Day actually?


AUSTIN: No, this isn’t a bit.


SYLVIA: No it’s—


AUSTIN: Actually it is a bit, because Mole Day has nothing to do with moles? What is Mole Day? Celebrated annually—


KEITH: Is it the day about the molecular thing?


AUSTIN: Yeah, it is [Sylvia sighs]. “Celebrated annually on October 23rd, from 6:02 am to 6:02 pm—”so it’s not even Mole Day anymore, where I’m at. “Mole Day commemorates Avo—Avogadro’s number, which is a basic measuring unit in chemistry. Mole Day was fostered as a way to—was created as a way to foster interest in chemistry. Schools throughout the United States and around the world celebrate Mole Day with various activities related to chemistry and/or moles.”


ART: It did not work.


AUSTIN: What? No, no. 


ART: I do not think that Mole Day got anyone in.


AUSTIN: No. One mole is—


SYLVIA: It got me in for a second, and then it immediately disappointed me by being about math. 


AUSTIN: And not about moles.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Their icon—their, like—you know, I’m gonna pull it up on stream, one second. Their image—


KEITH: Oh, it’s a little science mole!


AUSTIN: Is a little science mole. So, like—


KEITH: It’s like a Charlie Brown science mole.


AUSTIN: Yeah. So what the fuck?


KEITH: It is sort of like “What if Charlie Brown was missing two-thirds of his head?” It’s sort of like—[laughs]


SYLVIA: Oh no, Charlie!


AUSTIN: Charlie! Noooooo, what happened? Someone did a fatality on you!


KEITH: It’s the Great Pumpkin.


AUSTIN: I hate that.


SYLVIA: He landed really bad from missing that kick.


AUSTIN: Their 2019 theme, by the way, is “Despica-mole Me.”


ART: Oh no. 


[Austin laughs]


KEITH: Nailed it.


AUSTIN: Let me look at their past themes. Past themes...1991: “The Mole the Merrier.” 


KEITH: Don’t they know that—I mean, we’re past Despica-mole Mole. We’re way into Moulnions now. 


ART: Ugh.


AUSTIN: 2018’s was “Moley Potter.” [laughs]


ART: That doesn’t work.


AUSTIN: [laughs] Moley Potter. [yelps] Aaah! 


KEITH: Sorry, Art, which of these—


AUSTIN: Aaahhh, look at the stream! Everyone look at the stream! Look at this terrible Moley Potter!


ART: Oh noooo!


KEITH: Oh nooo! 


SYLVIA: That’s—


DRE: [laughing] Yeah. 


AUSTIN: I’m closing it. I feel like I’ve committed a horrible act.


SYLVIA: Yeah—


KEITH: Is this like for a color—like, can you color this in? Is this like a coloring book thing? 


AUSTIN: It—well—oh, wait, there’s—you can actually get this in color. Oh boy, the Molevengers are [laughs]. Oh my God. 


SYLVIA: Oh no. 


[Austin laughs]


ART: Oh no, the green one!


[Austin keeps laughing]


AUSTIN: Ohhhh. 


KEITH: Let’s see—oh, there we go. 


AUSTIN: Let’s zoom out. 


SYLVIA: They tried to make Black Widow sexy still.


AUSTIN: They did. They truly did.


[Keith laughs wildly]


AUSTIN: Earth’s Mightiest Unit. 


DRE: [laughing] Molevengers.


KEITH: I think my stream is a little bit behind, so I didn’t see them trying to make Black Widow sexy still—


AUSTIN: Oh yeah, here you go. Here, I’ll zoom in for you. You want me to—


KEITH: Until—


AUSTIN: Oh, did you get it now? You get the—okay. 


KEITH: I did see it a second after, so it was like a really, um, what’s the opposite of a fun preview?


[Sylvia laughs]


AUSTIN: Uh-huh. 


KEITH: A bad preview! It really was a really shitty preview. 


AUSTIN: Where did they—where did they jump the shark here? “The Mole the Merrier”—okay. “The Mole the Merrier”—


ART: “The Mole the Merrier” is fine.  


AUSTIN: This is great.


ART: “Go for the Mole” I also think is fine.


AUSTIN: “Go for the Mole”...yeah, you know what? That’s—what is that, like an Olympian—like a Cesar—


SYLVIA: “Animole Kingdom” is upsetting to look at, personally.


AUSTIN: “Mole out the Barrel” isn’t great, ‘cause I don’t—ah, okay, that one’s like a naked mole in a barrel. “Animole Kingdom” you said? Uh—


SYLVIA: Yeah, it is, uh, 2013.


ART: Ohh.


AUSTIN: This is what like if Dreamworks decided to do—


KEITH: What does “Mole out the Barrel” mean?


AUSTIN: It’s like roll out the barrel. I don’t know what that means.


KEITH: I still don’t know what that means. 


AUSTIN: “Ace in the Mole.” This is the most Bluff City one, for sure [chuckles].


ART: Oh my—


KEITH: None of these help me with science. 


AUSTIN: They let you remember Mole’s number, or whatever.


SYLVIA: So, there’s a basketball one, Mole Madness, but it doesn't look like a mole. It looks like a nose with a mouth dunking a basketball.


[Austin laughs, Sylvia chuckles] 


AUSTIN: I mean, this is the thing, is they all look like noses with mouths [Keith laughs]. In such a way that makes me uncomfortable.


SYLVIA: Yeah…


AUSTIN: This is a night—I like this one that’s just “The Periodic Table of Elemolements.” ‘cause they were like after—oh wait, there was a Star Wars one.


SYLVIA: Yep.


AUSTIN: Aaaaaaaaaaohhhhhhhhhh [Sylvia chuckles]. 


ART: That one’s great.


AUSTIN: [laughs] Ohhhhoo. Oh. 


KEITH: Why “Elemolements” and not “Elemoles”? Why did they keep going?


AUSTIN: [laughing] I don’t know. 


SYLVIA: Or “Molements.” There’s two better ways to do that. 


AUSTIN: “Moles of the Caribbean”, oh my God [laughs].


KEITH: This is like—


ART: —don’t click on that one.


AUSTIN: I did, I did. I did.


KEITH: What if— 


ART: —first appearance might have been in “Moles of the Caribbean.”


AUSTIN: [laughing] Yup. 


KEITH: This is—these are made by the guy that got fired from making Big Dog shirts. 


[Sylvia laughs]


AUSTIN: Oh my God. We got two over here in 2007. They couldn’t pick one. “Secret Agent Double-Mole-7 in: Moles are Forever.”


ART: Forever.


AUSTIN: Uh—


ART: And “Remember the Alamole.” 


AUSTIN: Or “Remember the Alamole.”


KEITH: “I’m nine, what do these mean?” 


[Austin laughs] 


KEITH: “Hi, I’m nine years old; I don’t get it.”


AUSTIN: “I don’t get it at all. At all” 


KEITH: “Isn’t this math class?”


AUSTIN: Oh boy, this is good. “Pie a la Mole” is [laughs]—that’s just two—


KEITH: That’s best one, honestly. That’s the best—


AUSTIN: I think this di—this roller skating diner server with—


SYLVIA: With a pizza-mouth. 


[Austin laughs] 


KEITH: I like “Pie a la Mole” because it basically means you’re sharing a pie with a mole.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Definitely! “We dig chemistry.” Still good, love it. Look, we dig chemistry, it’s a mole, got some tools...shout outs to that mole. Still, I’m trying to find the moment where it goes bad.


KEITH: The molement.


ART: It might be “It’s a Mole World.”


AUSTIN: Oh, is it like “It’s a Small World” but it’s moles?


ART: Yeah. I mean, I can’t know until you click on it because I’m not going on this website. 


AUSTIN: I clicked on it. It’s—[laughs]. It’s not great. It’s not good. But it’s not branded, you know?


ART: Sure.


AUSTIN: “Celebrate the Molennium.” This one is great. This is just the Jetsons, but a mole person. 


ART: Oh, it’s not the __ album?


SYLVIA: —that’s interesting. 


AUSTIN: It’s not. Uh-huh, yeah. “Molar Odyssey.” Wait, this isn’t what I thought it would be at all. I thought it would be like “A Polar Odyssey” but this is “2001: A Space Odyssey” but with a mole.


SYLVIA: Yeah.  


AUSTIN: Also, that poor mole’s nose does not fit [laughs] in that helmet. 


KEITH: Oh, did you think that this was gonna be like Homer’s “the Odyssey”, but with a mole?


AUSTIN: I—you know what I actually thought, it’s—I think it’s because of Mo—oh, the Molar Eclipse. I thought one of these was “Molar Express”—it is. Molar Ex—well, this still isn’t what I thought it would be. I thought “Molar Express” was gonna be a “Polar Express” joke, but it’s just a train. It’s just a train. 


SYLVIA: Do you spell it like the tooth?


AUSTIN: That—you’re right, sorry. Am I now saying it wrong?


SYLVIA: No, they just spell it like the tooth.


AUSTIN: They do.


SYLVIA: So it makes me think of the tooth phrasing. 


KEITH: [laughs] It should be the Moler Express.


AUSTIN: “Mole of Fortune—”


ART: Yeah, Mole-r. 


AUSTIN: “Mole of Fortune” might be the spot. I think this might be it. 


KEITH: As the best or the worse?


AUSTIN: The worst. Or the beginning of the bad. 


ART: Oof.


AUSTIN: It’s not good. 


ART: “Molevanna” is rough.


AUSTIN: “Molevanna”...yeah. Alright. Have we seen “Moles of the Round Table”? They got lazy.


KEITH: They look like—it looks like someone really messed up drawing a shark, also.


AUSTIN: Yes.


KEITH: Like I—the nose thing is real but some of them look like bad sharks.


AUSTIN: If they had sharp teeth, that would be it.


KEITH: Yeah, it’s like a curse made a shark’s mouth in the wrong spot in the wrong size.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Yeah. Alright, I’m gonna close—oh, they have a store. Can I get prints?


KEITH: [whispers] Buy a shirt.


AUSTIN: Oh, there it is. Oh boy. There it is. There it is. 


KEITH: Oh, there’s a Mole of the Year. 


AUSTIN: “Despicamole Me” you can get—those are just—this is just the thing [laughs].


KEITH: By the way, I—


ART: That’s—that’s Gru. That’s—they’re gonna get sued.


AUSTIN: They’re gonna get sued!


KEITH: Someone groaned when I said “Molenions” but that’s not any worse than most of these.


SYLVIA: No, it’s not. It just—mulling it—[Keith laughs]. There’s something about it...one, I can’t say it. And two, it really is upsetting to me [Keith laughs more].


ART: I can’t believe we didn’t get “There’s something about Mole-y” back in—


SYLVIA: Oh no. 


[Austin laughs]


SYLVIA: Oh nooo. 


AUSTIN: Oh boy. 


ART: There’s a “Mole Be With You” shirt. 


AUSTIN: There is a “Mole Be With You” shirt. 


ART: All sold out. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, there’s a lot. There’s ornaments. “Mole Day is King.” Can you imagine it’s a holiday and you [laughs] open it up, and what you got is...this...in front of it? I don’t even know how to describe this thing that I’m looking at.


[Sylvia laughs]


KEITH: [laughs] It’s an ornamental stone! 


AUSTIN: [laughs] It’s an ornamental stone that you can wear as a necklace or put on a tree. Oh, it’s Elvis Prestley as a mole. 


SYLVIA: Oh, okay. I really like the idea of putting a “Mole Day is King” thing on a Christmas tree, because then you’re really sticking it to Christmas.


AUSTIN: Then, yeah. Guess what? Christ isn’t king, this fucking mole is.


[Keith laughs] 


AUSTIN: Tattoos...If y’all want some Mole Day tattoos…


KEITH: [laughing] It would be very disappointing to, like, you know, you’re maybe fourteen, fifteen, maybe one of your parents is a science teacher and you get a Mole Day T-shirt on Christmas or something. That would be upsetting, that one of your gifts was a Mole Day T-shirt, but what if all of your gifts were also [laughing].
AUSTIN: [laughing] One after another. 


[Keith guffaws] 


SYLVIA: That’s when you start worrying about Dad. 


AUSTIN: Oh my God. 


KEITH: [still laughing] “All of a sudden, I have nine of these.” 


AUSTIN: Oh. It’s brilliant, it’s the best.


ART: That’s everyone’s corporate gift this year. 


KEITH: They’re cheap too—ten bucks for a shirt. That’s a bargain, honestly. 


AUSTIN: That’s a deal. It’s a deal. 


KEITH: Ten bucks for a T-shirt? In 2019? That is a deal. It’s a deal and a steal.


AUSTIN: Twice the price. Um, alright, we should do a podcast. We should do a clap.


SYLVIA: Right. 


AUSTIN: [laughs] Oh my God. Uh, do you want to clap at ten seconds?


SYLVIA: Sure. 




[musical interlude, 25:45]




ALI: ...Allergenic and precious metals section? [laughs]


AUSTIN: Mhm.


ALI: It’s very nice. Just—


JANINE: Hm. Are they still around?


ALI: Yeah! 


JANINE: Okay. I thought they were—they’re not in—


ALI: No.


JANINE: I think they died up here. 


ALI: No, sometimes you have Claire’s and then sometimes you have the slightly older Claire’s, which is Icing. Um—


JANINE: Icing?


ALI: Yeah. Yeah [laughs].


JANINE: I’ve never heard of Icing. 


ALI: They’re the same company. Sometimes the same products. There’s some in the, like, the two circles of [laughs] Claire’s Magazine.


[Dre laughs]


ALI: Of the, like, the young market.


JANINE: So we have—we have—and growing up, for me, my Claire’s was Arden. Or Arden’s? Ardene? I don’t remember. 


DRE: Oh.


JANINE: And that was where I got my three for $10 friendship necklaces and scrunchies and whatnot. And then Claire’s showed up, also.


AUSTIN: Kicked the shit outta Ardene. 


[Dre laughs]


JANINE: No! ‘Cause Claire’s is gone from that mall and Ardene is bigger than ever.


AUSTIN: Ohhhh. 


ALI: Oh.


DRE: Wow. 


JANINE: Ardene expanded into shitty clothing and they seem to be doing okay, I guess, I don’t really know. 


[Ali laughs]


JANINE: But they did have—


AUSTIN: They have—[reading Wikipedia] “Ardene sells a vast assortment of apparel, shoes, and accessories. Since 2015, the company has introduced clothing lines such as: EIGHTYTWO denim, MOVE Activewear, Rose + Vine lingerie, A.C.W. contemporary wear [snorts], 82 North outerwear, a.co beauty—” and then a bunch of things that are just Ardene...Ardene Occasion, Ardene Home, et cetera.


ALI: Huh.


JANINE: I’m sure it's all just, like, what’s that term? Whitelabel or whatever.


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That’s—


JANINE: Where it’s just you put your own fucking shit on there.


AUSTIN: Yeah, definitely. 


JANINE: It’s probably that.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm. Anyway. You know. Shoutouts to—


JANINE: Ardene? 


AUSTIN: —affordable apparel. 


[Ali giggles]


JANINE: Yeah, I—I don’t know how affordable it is, to be honest.


AUSTIN: Right, sure. Fair.


JANINE: Relative to other options.


AUSTIN: Fair, fair. Uh—


JANINE: Especially quality. An affordable shirt that lasts you a week is not a good deal.


AUSTIN: No. But, again, sometimes—


JANINE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: It be like that.


JANINE: Yeah, it do. 


AUSTIN: Um, alright. We should t—do a clap. 


ALI: Yes. 


DRE: Oh yeah, right.


ALI: Those are important. Do we want to get a Craig in here?


AUSTIN: Yeah, can we get a Craig—can we get a Craig in here?


ALI: Yo, Craig.


JANINE: Get like a—


AUSTIN: Hey, Craig? Can we get a Craig? 


JANINE: One of the Craigs, please. A Craig with extra Craigsauce.


DRE: Eughh. 


[Janine laughs] 


[Austin laughs]


DRE: Oh God, Craig Solao [laughs]. 


[Ali laughs]
  
AUSTIN: [laughing] Craig Solao. International Mountain Day. Shoutouts to mountains, you know?


DRE: Oohh.


AUSTIN: Mountains are home to fifteen percent of the world, a quarter of the world’s land animals and plants.


JANINE: Huh.


AUSTIN: That’s a lot. 


ALI: Wait, fifteen percent isn’t a quarter.


AUSTIN: No, fifteen percent of the world’s human population is probably what the UN means.


ALI: Ohhhh.


JANINE: And then also some animals and plants.


AUSTIN: And then quarter of animals and plants


ALI: Ohhh.  


AUSTIN: Mm-hm. Stop fucking up mountains. That’s what the UN says. 


ALI: Oof. 


DRE: Hey, yeah. Shoutout to Kentucky. We should stop fucking up mountains. 


[Ali laughs]


JANINE: Mm. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, I—


DRE: We are real good at fucking up mountains. 


AUSTIN: Seems like a problem to me. 


DRE: It’s real bad.


AUSTIN: Uhhhh, fifteen?


ALI: Yeah.


[pause, followed by claps]


AUSTIN: Okay. Um…we good?


JANINE: I can’t find my rulebook.


AUSTIN: That’s a prob. Uh...should be in the drive still.


DRE: Okay, back. When I clapped, I accidentally knocked my headphones off the desk. 


ALI: Oohh. 


AUSTIN: Dre. That’s too powerful a clap.


[Dre laughs] 


ALI: Yeah. We don’t need a clap that hard. 


AUSTIN: A clap too strong. We don’t. Alright. 


ALI: There we go.


AUSTIN: Ready? Are we good? Any other non-recording convos? 


JANINE: Uh, Swiss Chalet’s doing their holiday stuff so I got a bag of truffles. 


ALI: Oooh.


AUSTIN: Ooh. 


DRE: Oooooh. 


ALI: Just—wait, just truffles? You mean the candy? [laughs]


JANINE: Yeah. Yes. No, yeah, no, they do a—[Ali laughs wildly, Dre laughs] the thing they do is like—what?


ALI: [laughing] I’m laughing at myself for believing for a second that they—[laughs more]


JANINE: [disbelievingly] That they would have a bag of expensive mushrooms?


[Austin chuckles]


DRE: I’m laughing at Ali. 


JANINE: That’s my thing, is that I talk about eating diamond jewelry [Austin and Dre laugh], I shit on cheap clothing, and then I eat a bag of very expensive mushrooms for Christmas. 


AUSTIN: Uh-huh. Very expensive mushrooms. Yeah. 


DRE: This latest season of Schitt’s Creek is wild.  


JANINE: Because they came with my fuckin’ twelve dollar chicken dinner, I guess. 


[Ali giggles]


AUSTIN: [laughs] Delicious. Incredible. 


[Ali sighs]


AUSTIN: Are we talking more of a black truffle or like a summer truffle? What—which of these two things I’ve looked up on Wikipedia? 


JANINE: So there’s a—there’s a milk one, and a cacao—a sixty percent cacao—


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


JANINE: And then a white, and then a hazelnut, and then a fudge swirl, which is new, and I actually don’t like that. 


AUSTIN: Mhm.


JANINE: Normally that’s caramel. I don’t—what happened there? What the fuck? Fudge swirl? 


AUSTIN: They’ve lost the caramel sponsorship, so.




[musical interlude, 31:03]




JANINE: Why did they give Big Bird a lie detector test? Who is this for?


AUSTIN: What?


ALI: Wait, what? [laughs]


JANINE: I’m just, I’m just like [sighs]. I just out of habit was like “I’m going to look at what’s recommended on Youtube in case there’s some—there’s never shit, but, like, ‘Big Bird takes a lie detector test.’”


AUSTIN: I think the lie detector test is a running bit. 


JANINE: Okay.


AUSTIN: That’s where that, you know—


JANINE: Oh, sure. 


ALI: On Sesame Street? 


JANINE: No [laughs]. 


AUSTIN: Yes.


JANINE: On Vanity Fair’s Youtube channel.


ALI: Ohh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. 


AUSTIN: Yes. Yes [laughs]. I do like the idea, though [Ali laughs]. Of it being on Sesame Street. 


JANINE: I don’t. That’s menacing.   


AUSTIN: It’s terrible! It’s the worst!


[Ali laughs]


JANINE: Stop and Frisk Sesame Street is not okay.


AUSTIN: That’s a skit, right? That’s like a Key and Peele skit? Someone’s done Stop and Frisk Sesame Street?


JANINE: Probably. Almost certainly.




[musical interlude, 32:14]




JACK: I was playing Destiny earlier, and I don’t know what their mic setup is, whether it’s push-to-talk or always on, so I just muted all my microphones on my desk [chuckles].


KEITH: Oh yeah. 


JACK: As like a preemptive—


AUSTIN: All of them. Just in case. 


JACK: In case they’re listening through one of them. 


AUSTIN: They could be. They could be listening right now.


JACK: They could be. They could be listening right now. But the good news is, I saved Saint-14 from the Infinite Garden and brought him back to the tower. So.


AUSTIN: Nice. Good. 


JACK: They’re all super grateful to me right now. 


AUSTIN: Nice helmet.


JACK: Saint-14? Yeah, he’s an Exo, did you know that?


AUSTIN: Yes—no? No, I didn’t. 


JACK: That’s his face; he’s not a human. 


AUSTIN: That’s not a helmet?


JACK: There’s nothing underneath that helmet. No, that is Saint-14. 


AUSTIN: Ohhh, okay. Good? Good. Good. How do you—how do you feel about the fact that Saint-14 is the most Friends at the Table name in the sense [chuckles] that it is a number of different Friends at the Table names just combined?


JACK: Mhmm. I’m fine with it, honestly.


AUSTIN: Okay.


JACK: There are—it’s not like an Aria Joie situation—


AUSTIN: No.


JACK: I feel good about the property.  


AUSTIN: I see. I see. Unlike Overwatch, which—


JACK: Which is cop propaganda. 


AUSTIN: Which is, yeah, coproganda. I feel like the other thing here to note is I feel like, if you checked the records, I definitely was sending you images of the Grimoire from Destiny 1—


JACK: Oh, oh. Look—


AUSTIN: In a way—


JACK: —It’s the snake eating its own tail, Austin.


AUSTIN: Exactly. Which is to say, yes, there was absolutely some influence there felt from Destiny on early Friends at the Table, so.


JACK: Early?  


AUSTIN: Yeah!


JACK: I think current [snorts].


AUSTIN: Oh, yes. But I mean from the jump, is what I mean.


JACK: Oh, right. Yeah. 


AUSTIN: I mean that first game came out while we were—before we recorded COUNTER/Weight, so.


JACK: 2006. 


AUSTIN: Yes, exactly. Exactly.


SYLVIA: I played through, like, all of Destiny 2 and I could not tell you a single thing about it.


JACK: No, that’s the same; it’s basically—


KEITH: I played all of it twice and I still can’t tell you anything about it [laughs].  


AUSTIN: The—you go near the sun that one time; that’s cool.


SYLVIA: Yeah, I remember that. 


JACK: Mm-hm. 


KEITH: That was really good, yeah. 


AUSTIN: There’s a hawk. 


SYLVIA: I got to throw a knife and the knife would explode and that was neat.


JACK: Yeah, that stuff’s great. 


AUSTIN: That stuff’s cool. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.


JACK: That stuff’s really great. I really like how the big—the villains of the big Destiny campaign now are so roundly defeated that they are desperately and inexpertly trying to invent time travel. 


[Sylvia laughs]


JACK: Just to be like “Oh, Jesus Christ.” 


AUSTIN: “Can we just—can we get a do-over?” 


JACK: “Can we go back? Can we try again?” 


AUSTIN: God. I really want—I proposed what a Destiny 3 or another big, big, big expansion would look like and I want it really bad. I want uneasy alliance between humanity—like, the Guardians, the—what are the—the Fallen, and the Cabal, is that the third group? 


KEITH: You’re talking about Halo 3, when you sometimes fought with elites. 


AUSTIN: I am talking about Halo 3, when you sometimes fought with elites. 


KEITH: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Versus the Hive, the Vex, and the Darkness. That’s what I really want. 


JACK: I think that’s abso—a big 14 character moment is that he’s kind of xen—wildly xenophobic.


AUSTIN: Ah, good, yeah.


SYLVIA: Ah, okay. 


JACK: He’s like [as Saint-14] “The Fallen! They’re monsters through and through!” And, like, the ghost pushes back on it. 


AUSTIN: Ohh.


JACK: Which is—


AUSTIN: “Actually, there’s this one that we talked to this one time.”


JACK: Yeah. 


SYLVIA: “Actually, I had a Fallen friend.”


JACK: [laughing] I have a Fallen friend. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh-huh. 


JACK: Ghost’s line is like—it’s exact. Ghost’s line is “Eh, some of them.” Which is like, yeah. 


AUSTIN: [laughs] [recovering] Ah, that’s very good.  


JACK: Yeah, I feel I could totally see them, between Spider and the Prisoner of Elder stuff, I could seem them being like “We can learn how to speak Fallen.” And—


AUSTIN: Right, right. 


JACK: Which—you would think we could do already, right?


AUSTIN: You would think. Well, there’s definitely—there’s definitely that one thing in Destiny 2 where you follow the one Fallen, the Destiny 2 base campaign side mission where you follow one of these—


JACK: Oh, the Fallen Captain? 


AUSTIN: Is that—yeah. And he comes back, is what my understanding is, right?


JACK: Oh, for real? That’s great. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, I think he’s—I think he comes back in that most—not Forsaken, what’s the most recent one? 


JACK: Shadowkeep.


AUSTIN: Shadowkeep. I believe that comes back in Shadowkeep for a quest. Like, a specific quest. 


JACK: Also, Keith.


KEITH: Yeah?


JACK: You’ll be very pleased to know: I tried playing Crucible and I did way better than I thought I would.


KEITH: Great, yeah!


JACK: I was second on the leaderboard. 


KEITH: I sort of like Crucible. I think it’s really fun. I—the weirdest thing about Crucible is that for the people that made Halo, it’s really limited. There’s not a lot of different things you can do. 


JACK: Mhm.


KEITH: Or I feel like Halo was defined by having multiplayer so robust that, like, they stole a bunch of fan content as their own game types for later Halo games [chuckles]. Which is shitty, but at least those game types are really fun to play, actually.


SYLVIA: The Doda model. 


KEITH: Yes, yeah.


JACK: Mm, the Doda model. Or the Valve model.


KEITH: Yeah. But yeah, some of my best memories are playing custom Halo 2 games that had bizarre, crazy rules. And you just can’t do that sort of thing in Crucible, which is sort of a bummer. 


AUSTIN: Damn. His name is Mithrax. He’s—


KEITH: His name is Mithrax.


AUSTIN: Mithrax the Forsaken. 


JACK: All the fucking Fallen...everyone in Destiny has a name like—


KEITH: Is this the captain you’re talking about?


AUSTIN: Yeah. 


KEITH: I actually know this mission, which is bizarre that I know a Destiny 2 mission.


AUSTIN: And he ends up founding the House of Light. He was formerly a captain of the House of Dust and he then founds the House of Light, which accepts Guardians into it. 


SYLVIA: Is Mithrax a member of Organization XIII? 


AUSTIN: Yes. 


SYLVIA: With a name like that.


AUSTIN: Yes, Mithrax is. 


JACK: Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: Let’s see what's—let’s figure this out here. How do I do—is there a—


SYLVIA: Marthi? 


AUSTIN: [laughs] It could—I guess it could be Marthi. 


[Sylvia laughs]


SYLVIA: I was like “Oh, is it Marth?” which—that would have been funny.


AUSTIN: Anagram...solver…


SYLVIA: I don’t know how it’s spelled, so.


AUSTIN: Uh, kind of like how you imagine. M-I-T-H-R-A-X. 


SYLVIA: Okay.


AUSTIN: Uh, none of these are names. I’m looking, none—Thiram. Thairm.


SYLVIA: I could see a weird spelling of theorem being a Kingdom Hearts character.


AUSTIN: That’s true, agreed. Agreed. It would be spelled weird but you would just say Theorem, like the word ‘theorem’.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh-huh. 


JACK: Jamaican [Ja-my-can]


AUSTIN: Right [laughs]. Jamaican [Ja-my-can]. Exactly. Alright, we should do a clap.


JACK: Have we still got Art? Or are you just being quiet? 


ART: Just being quiet, I just don’t have a lot of Destiny 2 thoughts. 


JACK: That’s fine.


ART: Which is fine, yeah.


KEITH: That’s fair.


AUSTIN: Yeah, I gotcha. 


JACK: Yeah, let’s clap. I feel like it’s been fucking forever since we’ve recorded.


AUSTIN: It has been.


SYLVIA: It’s been two—I, so I checked just because I was checking something else and it’s been two months since we’ve recorded.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


JACK: Oh my God. Also, has something happened to time.is?


AUSTIN: Holidays happened, everyone was sick...


JACK: The font has changed.


AUSTIN: Oh my God. 


ART: The font is bad. 


KEITH: Yeah, we all—we know about it. You can change it back.


SYLVIA: I changed mine to Helvetica. ‘Cause it’s—


JACK: How? 


AUSTIN: In the bottom left, it says “Customize.” You can click that and change it. There’s a number of different options. 


[Jack gasps]


KEITH: I don’t—What you can’t change—what you can’t change is they turned from a black to a medium gray. 


JACK: Mhm.


AUSTIN: Wait, what’s—what? What?


KEITH: They changed the number of the digits from black to like a medium gray. 


JACK: They did. 


AUSTIN: Oh, I—I made the whole thing the other way.


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: I made the whole thing white-on-black. We’ve been over—Keith and I—


JACK: So they changed it from white to a medium cream.


KEITH: Yeah, yeah.


SYLVIA: We had this conversation before Tips, I think.


AUSTIN: Right. That is what happened with the three of us. 


KEITH: We also had it one other time. 


AUSTIN: At least.


[Keith laughs]


KEITH: Look, we’re very familiar with time.is. 


SYLVIA: Yeah.


KEITH: You can’t expect us to not be hung up on the time.is details!


AUSTIN: This is our—talking about the weather is talking [laughs] about time.is.


[Keith and Sylvia laugh] 


JACK: “Ah, time.is is weird today.”


SYLVIA: Wait, what’s the quote? 


AUSTIN: “What’s the quote, what’s the quote?” Exactly, yes. Ooh, I’m point eight seconds behind, ah! 


JACK: That’s Ben Franklin. 


AUSTIN: It is Ben Frank—well, it’s Ben Franklin Day, apparently. 


JACK: It’s Ben Franklin Day today?


AUSTIN: That’s what time.is is telling me.


ART: Yeah, everyone in America is celebrating it. 


AUSTIN: You’re not in your Ben Franklin costume?


ART: We all are.


AUSTIN: Yeah. 


[Jack chuckles]


ART: All three—me, Austin, and Keith are definitely all in full Ben Franklin costume.


JACK: That’s incredible! 


AUSTIN: I got the glasses, I got the wig, it’s a whole thing.


KEITH: I went to the—I went to all the post offices in walking distance and said “Thank you for your service.” 


[Sylvia laughs] 


JACK: Mhm.


AUSTIN: Yeah. 


JACK: He invented the mail, right? 


KEITH: He invented the mail, yeah. 


JACK: And the iPhone.


AUSTIN: He invented the mail. He also invented the hundred dollar bill. And the iPhone, yes. 


SYLVIA: And kites.


AUSTIN: And also kites. 


JACK: Kites. 


KEITH: And—no.


AUSTIN: Even more? Or no, you forgotten—you’ve forgotten the last one. 


KEITH: It’s something to do with glasses. Did he—


ART: Bifocals.


AUSTIN: The bifocal. 


SYLVIA: The bifocals.


KEITH: Bifocals, right. 


SYLVIA: I know that one from National Treasure. 


AUSTIN: Yeah. 


[Jack chuckles]


AUSTIN: Also a certain type of stove he invented. 


JACK: It’s called the Benjamin Franklin. 


KEITH: Did he also start the first volunteer fire service before there was firefighters? I think that’s true. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, that sounds right.


JACK: How’s Lemony Snicket? 


AUSTIN: He also claimed—he—he seems to—there’s an entry here of list of things he’s invented on Wikipedia. 


JACK: Mhm.


AUSTIN: I know this is a show that people are supposed to pay for. But we’re just gonna do this real quick. 


[Sylvia laughs]


AUSTIN: “Inventions and scientific inquiries includes: electricity, population studies, Atlantic Ocean currents, wave theory of light, meteorology, traction kiting, a specific type of kiting—”


SYLVIA: What’d I say? I said kites.


AUSTIN: So “specifically using kites to pull humans and ships across waterways.” 


[Jack laughs] 


AUSTIN: Uh, “The concept—” 


ART: I don’t want to be on that boat [laughs].


AUSTIN: No [laughs]. “The concept of cooling.” Wait a second, that concept—uh, sorry.


JACK: “I’m too warm,” said Benjamin Franklin. 


[Austin and Keith laugh]


KEITH: For thousands of years people were like “I’m getting not hot. I’m getting different hot, what is that?”


[Austin laughs]


JACK: “This is more pleasant, until it stops being pleasant, and then I don’t enjoy it.”


AUSTIN: This is—I’m gonna read. “Franklin noted [laughs] a principle of refrigeration—” This fucking sentence. “Franklin noted a principle of refrigeration by observing that on a very hot day, he stayed cooler in a wet shirt in a breeze than he did in a dry one.” [laughs]


[Jack chuckles] 


ART: It was so easy to invent things back then.


KEITH: There’s no way he invented that. 


AUSTIN: [laughing] No, there’s no way! 


KEITH: This is some—this is some dumb shit of weirdo Europeans, every time they have a thought, they think they invented something. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, one hundred percent. Um, they—


ART: No, no, he invented “wet shirt” [laughs].


AUSTIN: Yup. Shoutouts. 


JACK: It’s like dry shirt, but it’s more uncomfortable unless it’s a hot day. 


KEITH: Have you—


SYLVIA: He just got sweaty! 


KEITH: “I just got—I was walking the street, I got this pamphlet, it said ‘Did you hear about wet shirt?’” 


[Austin and Sylvia laughs]


AUSTIN: He ends up doing a bunch of science where he ends up wetting a thermometer and showing that the water—that the evaporation of the water cools the ether in the thermometer, whatever. Whatever, whatever, whatever. Uh, temperatures affect electric—


JACK: Austin, did you say “cools the ether” like we’re in Final Fantasy XIV? [laughs]


AUSTIN: That’s what it says. That’s what I’m reading. ‘Cause he did it with a mercury thermometer and with ether, using bellows to evaporate the ether—whatever. 


KEITH: “Smell this ether and look at this thermometer.” 


SYLVIA: I—


AUSTIN: I haven’t even gotten to the one I want to get to!


KEITH: Sorry, sorry.


AUSTIN: I—I want to let you know, in—right now I’ve skimmed the rest and there’s a different one I’m more furious about. 


SYLVIA: [laughing] Sorry, if Ben Franklin told me to get a wet shirt and then smell some ether, I would run away.


[Austin laughs]


JACK: Goodbye, Ben!


AUSTIN: Goodbye! 


KEITH: Known lewd man, Ben Franklin.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Yes.


SYLVIA: Exactly!


AUSTIN: Uh, “Temperatures affect electrical conductivity—” Sure. That one—sure. I bet.


JACK: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: That seems like a—


JACK: That’s some fuckin’ science there, you know. 


AUSTIN: “Oceanography findings,” which is just he found ideas for “anchors, catamaran holes, water-tight compartments, shipboard lighting rods, and a soup bowl designed to stay stable in stormy weather.” [laughs] Great. Great. This next one is the one that I didn’t plan on—


KEITH: He invented Weeble Wobbles.


AUSTIN: “Decision-making.” 


ART: What the—[laughs]


JACK: Mm. Mm-hm.  


KEITH: What does that mean?


SYLVIA: Aaron Sorkin wrote this.


AUSTIN: You—I’m gonna read this out loud ‘cause it’s—at first you’re like “Oh, this must mean a very specific system of decision-making”, right? You’re thinking to yourself some sort of game theory or something, you know what I mean? 


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: One of those.


KEITH: A mind palace. 


AUSTIN: It’s not. Yeah, exactly. “In a 1772 letter to Joseph Priestly, Franklin lays out the earliest known depiction of the pros and cons list, a common decision-making technique—” [All laugh] “Now sometimes called a decision ballot sheet.” Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up. 


KEITH: Before that, the world operated by the principle of Dril tweet. 


[more laughter] 


JACK: Things are good and bad at the same time. 


AUSTIN: [laughing] Things are good and bad at the same time. “My way is to divide a sheet of paper into a line of two columns, writing over the one ‘Pro’ and over the other ‘Con’. Then during three or four days consideration, I put down under the different heads short hints of the different motives that at different times occur to me for or against the measure.” I just want to let you know, many of the words I just said were capitalized, but not—there’s—every noun, I think every noun was capitalized, just ‘cause. And then eventually, just so you know, when he gets them all together, he estimates their respective weights and where he finds two, one on each side, that seem equal he strikes them both out.


KEITH: Mhm. 


SYLVIA: What?


AUSTIN: But if he thinks a pro—if a pro is equal to two cons, he strikes all three of them out. And whatever’s left behind is how he makes his decision. So if you're, like, a hot—wearing a wet T-shirt on a hot day [chuckles], pro: it makes me a little cooler; con: I look goofy; con: I then—


KEITH: It’s still sticky. 


AUSTIN: It’s sticky. And you’re like, “Oh well, you know what, that pro of being cooler is equal to both of those two cons, I’ll strike all three of them out.” Or if—or if you go “Oh, it’s only equal to one of them,” then you go “Con, I’m not gonna wear the wet T-shirt.” 


JACK: Fuck you, Ben Franklin.


AUSTIN: Anyway, the last thing is oil on water. The last thing he invented was oil on water [laughs]. He noticed that when the greasy—when grease hit water while he was on a ship, he decided that “Oil calms the waters.” Because of the way oil and water mix. Or don’t mix.


KEITH: We should spill some oil on the water to make it—


AUSTIN: “We should spill some oil, make it a little calmer!” He used the trick to calm the waters by carrying “A little oil in the hollow joint of my cane.” 


KEITH: So, so, this is not an invention; this is some bullshit that he thought that isn’t true.


[Austin laughs]


AUSTIN: I mean—


ART: Yeah, I don’t think a cane’s worth of oil is gonna make your boat ride any better. You’re just gonna get through that one spot of water and then be in more water. 


AUSTIN: That doesn’t even have the oven I was talking about—or the furnace?


KEITH: I don’t even think you’d get through one spot; you’d just drop some oil in the water [Austin laughs]. And that’s it. 


AUSTIN: [laughing] The rest of the ocean, that’s it.


KEITH: And it can still have waves. 


AUSTIN: [laughing] Ohhh. 


JACK: Also, if he hadn’t fuckin’ dropped all these papers in Assassin’s Creed.


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh-huh. We wouldn’t know about any of this shit. 


JACK: Yeah. Well, no, fuck that guy, he should’ve kept better hold of his papers because I spent forever. 


SYLVIA: Oh, it’s—that’s why you can swim in later games, because they got okay with having their shirts wet.


JACK: Ohh, he got a cane. 


AUSTIN: Yeah—oh.


JACK: Exactly.


[Austin laughs]


SYLVIA: The bit checks out, don’t—don’t look at the timeline on that.   


JACK: If he touches water, he dies instantly.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm. Uh, some other things he invented here: we know about the lightning rod, obviously. Bifocals. 


JACK: Swimming.


AUSTIN: Swim fins, yes. Was that a joke? Or did you know this? 


JACK: Yeah, I was just joking.


AUSTIN: Yeah, he invented swim fins. He was eleven when he invented “swimming fins,” two oval pieces of wood—


JACK: He was eleven? Bullshit [laughs].


AUSTIN: “—that when—” okay, again, this is just a thing a kid did. “Two oval pieces of wood that, when grasped in the hands, provided extra thrust through water. He also tried out fins for his feet, but they weren’t as effective.”  Uh, no. 


KEITH: Well, he was wrong. 


AUSTIN: [laughing] He was so opposite. 


JACK: “Hand me that log, I shall be like a fish!” 


AUSTIN: [laughing] Yeah, that’s—we can’t retroactively make every stupid idea he had when he was eleven an invention! 


SYLVIA: Benjamin Franklin—


KEITH: The person who wrote out this Wikipedia page must be some, like, Benjamin Franklin who’s, like, just fully obsessed. 


SYLVIA: It really feels like Benjamin Franklin was just, like, his entire personality was “bored dad on a Sunday.” 


JACK: Mhm. 


AUSTIN: Yes. Yes.


SYLVIA: And he’s just constantly fucking around and trying to, quote “invent things. ”


JACK: “I’ve invented a new way to grill.” 


AUSTIN: Yeah. Uh, also—


KEITH: “I invented using toothpicks to stick olives onto this paper plate and it looks like a face.” 


AUSTIN: Also—


SYLVIA: Except it was long enough ago and he was important enough that people actually paid attention. 


[Jack chuckles]


AUSTIN: Also, there’s just the thing of the dad who’s like, “Nah, I could build one of those. You’re hot—you’re hot? You want to move to a cooler place? I can cool this house down, put on this shirt.”


[Sylvia and Keith laugh]


AUSTIN: “You put on all these wet shirts, it’s gonna be fine.”  


ART: “All these wet shirts” makes [laughs] it sound much worse. 


AUSTIN: [laughing] It does sound worse, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t do three wet shirts.


SYLVIA: I’m never gonna be able to think of him in a dry shirt again. 


[Keith laughs]


AUSTIN: No, it’s done. This other site I’m looking at says that he invented American celebrity which—


JACK: Nmmmmm.


AUSTIN: Truly his worst offense. 


[Keith laughs]


AUSTIN: Of course, American political cartooning, they give him that. ‘Cause of that—‘cause the snake.


KEITH: Oh, did he do the snake? 


AUSTIN: Not the no-steppy snake, the other stake—snake. 


KEITH: Oh, okay. I don’t know that other one then.


ART: The other snake.


JACK: What other snake?


KEITH: There’s two famous American snake cartoons?


AUSTIN: Yeah! Yes! 


SYLVIA: There’s a lot of famous American snakes.


[Keith laughs]


AUSTIN: It’s the one that’s like—it’s the “Join or Die” one. Where it’s like a snake and they’re each of the different segments.


KEITH: Oh, the different segments. Yeah, the segmented, like, colonies, yeah.  


AUSTIN: Colonies, yeah, which would become—he also invented the armonica. Which is not me mispronouncing the harmonica. 


KEITH: Is the—


ART: Is it a harmonica that’s as big as your whole arm?


KEITH: It’s a—is it a harmonica that arpeggiates? 


AUSTIN: It’s a har—okay. “When in London, he saw for the first musical glasses—by which glasses were arranged around a table rubbed around the rims [laughs] with wet fingers to produce musical notes. To tune them, water had to be poured over them to obtain the right notes. He thought he could improve the experience by playing music with glasses. He arranged the glasses according to size and flexed them on a spindle. The spindle was set in a case and turned by a wheel. He called it armonica, and it became very popular in its day. Mozart and Beethoven composed for it,” this says. It’s like a piano of glass bowls. 


JACK: A glass harmonica, but a piano.


AUSTIN: I’m gonna link it in the—


KEITH: This sounds like a real invention. It’s stupid, but it sounds real 


AUSTIN: It’s real. It’s real. This is a real thing. It’s just very funny. [laughing] It’s very funny that, like, this second photo, and you would be like “Why did he store his bowls in there?”


[Art and Keith laugh]


KEITH: It really is just a collection of bowls.


AUSTIN: Yes. 


JACK: “That’s a really nice table where you’ve stored all your bowls. No, don’t touch it!”


SYLVIA: “Ooh, we’re having soup for dinner.” 


AUSTIN: “It’s beautiful.” Yeah [laughs]. Oh, he invented soup also, that’s a big—he did not do that. That one’s me. I made that one up. I think. If I type in “Benjamin Franklin soup” though…


JACK: He made the soup bowl. 


KEITH: No, soup is thousands of years old. 


AUSTIN: Right, right. 


JACK: And so is Benjamin Franklin. 


AUSTIN: Wait—


KEITH: He invented immortality. 


JACK: Remember when we found Judge Judy was, like, 1700 years old?


AUSTIN: The—I found the bowl that he made to keep soup from spilling.


JACK:  Oh, his soup bowl? 


AUSTIN: I’m gonna post it...there it is. “He loved a good meal, so it was not surprising to see that he invented an ingenious divided soup bowl to prevent spills while eating aboard his ship.”


KEITH: So it just collects in the outer cups?


AUSTIN: It’s—so, can you describe what we’re looking at here? 


KEITH: Yeah, so it looks like a kettle drum, or some sort of weird drum, upside down, and all the holes are filled with soup. Or, I guess, there’s one giant center hole that’s filled with a lot of...Coke, I guess, is what it looks like.


AUSTIN: It does look like that, yeah. 


KEITH: And then—or like watered down root beer.


SYLVIA: Drink. The drink. 


AUSTIN: The drinking Coke, yeah, not the—not snorting coke. 


KEITH: [laughing] Oh yeah. Sorry, yeah. It’s drinking Coke. Sipping Coke. And then, uh, there’s—what is it, eight—little holes on the outside; it looks like if it spills, you want to get it to spill into one of these little outer holes.


AUSTIN: [laughs] Yes. That’s right. That’s exactly right. “When the ship would make a sudden heel, the soup would not in a body flow over one side but would be retained in separate divisions.” [laughs] It’s like—


JACK: “Now I just have to eat the soup out of this bowl!”


KEITH: This—I have to be totally honest—


SYLVIA: I hate Benjamin Franklin. 


JACK: Yeah, fuck this guy! 


KEITH: I have to be totally honest, this doesn’t look like it works at all.


SYLVIA: No, it doesn’t. It looks stupid as hell and it looks like you’re gonna make way more of a mess.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm.


SYLVIA: That thing’s just gonna get covered in soup. It’s gonna get so sticky.


AUSTIN: Uh, I’m gonna send you one more thing. Y’all have to tell me what this is. And also describe what—


KEITH: Snowshoes.


SYLVIA: Damn, yeah, that’s a good guess. 


ART: Snowshoes is a great guess. I think they are the things you would wear on your feet to play some sort of giant foot-guitar.


[Austin and Keith laugh]


ART: They’re giant foot-guitar picks. 


AUSTIN: Well, Art, he did invent the giant foot-guitar, as we all know.


SYLVIA: Oh man. 


AUSTIN: Um—


JACK: They’re his flippers. 


AUSTIN: Those are his flippers. These are his flippers. 


SYLVIA: Oh my God.


AUSTIN: And they’re resting on a surface that says “Please touch.” Please—please touch.


JACK: No!


KEITH: It does say—oh, I didn’t even notice it says “Please touch.”


AUSTIN: [laughs] It’s very good.


KEITH: You can feel the craftsmanship even after hundreds of years. 


AUSTIN: Mm-hm. You know, shoutouts. Shoutouts to—let me say one nice thing for Ben Franklin. One, you know, while we’re here at the Ben Franklin roast. 


JACK: Mhm. 


AUSTIN: The yearly Ben Franklin roast, that we have as a trad—for the non-Americans here, this is a tradition every year.


SYLVIA: Oh, okay.


AUSTIN: We all get together, we roast Ben Franklin. 


JACK: On Ben Franklin Day.


ART: On Ben Franklin Day, yeah. 


AUSTIN: Yeah. This year we decided—


KEITH: The first Ben Franklin roast was a feast.


AUSTIN: Right, it was a feast. This year's topic was “inventions.” And—


JACK: As was last year’s.


AUSTIN: Yeah, and the year before—the year before that was “Why’d he take so long to free his slaves?”


KEITH: We eventually run out of Ben Franklin meats to eat at the roast, and now we just make fun of him.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Now we just do that. He has thirteen virtues, all of which are Divines, for sure. But the thing I wanted to actually shout out is—if I recall right, his feelings on copyright and on patent law were really, really good.


JACK: Well thought-out.


AUSTIN: He never patented any of his—he never patented anything. He was very much a copyleft dude who was like “No, put things into the public domain as soon as possible. If someone makes a better Franklin stove and they want to call it whatever, something else, good. If someone makes a better catheter than the catheter I made, good. People need catheters.” He also made a catheter. I left that out. Until just now. 


SYLVIA: Yeah, that checks out. 


AUSTIN: So. 


JACK: Well, I feel honored. Thank you for including me in these Ben Franklin Day celebrations.


AUSTIN: Of course.


KEITH: Yeah. 


SYLVIA: Yeah! It’s always nice to learn about other cultures. 


KEITH: Well, he did spend a lot of time in London and in Paris, so it does make sense.


AUSTIN: It’s true. It’s true. 


KEITH: We didn’t—we don’t have anyone French on the show, but.


JACK: No.


AUSTIN: No. Two Canadians. Which, not French. 


SYLVIA: No.


KEITH: No. But between one and one and a half removed.


AUSTIN: Right. 


ART: Janine confusingly is not French-Canadian but is a Candaian who speaks French.


AUSTIN: Correct.


SYLVIA: I save people that confusion by not understanding any French.


AUSTIN: Wait. His first post office was founded in Canada [laughs]. 


SYLVIA: What the fuck?! 


KEITH: Damn.


JACK: Sylvia[1], you’re welcome! 


SYLVIA: Oh, wow! 


AUSTIN: “Franklin opened the first post office to offer monthly mail in what would later become Canada, at Halifax.” Wild. 


SYLVIA: Why does it take stuff so long to get here from America, then?


AUSTIN: I don’t know [Jack chuckles]. A betrayal of Ben Franklin.


SYLVIA: Yeah. I got shit I’m waiting for. 


AUSTIN: [laughs] Alright, we should do a show. We should do a podcast.


SYLVIA: Right, that thing. 


ART: We didn’t actually clap.


AUSTIN: Oh fuck!


[Keith laughs]


ART: It’s—


AUSTIN: Good catch. 


ART: We did a Franklin-cast.


AUSTIN: I’m happy to have done a Franklin-cast, honestly. I think we can all wrap it up, that was—


SYLVIA: Keeping it Franklin, Friends at the Table.


KEITH: Shall we do a clapping pro and con list to see if it’s worth it at this point?


AUSTIN: To see if it’s worth—yeah, that’s fair.


JACK: Loud, frightening sometimes.


AUSTIN: Pro, pro—


KEITH: Confusing: no one really remembers how long seconds are.


JACK: Con.


AUSTIN: Con, that’s a con. 


KEITH: Oh, that’s a con. 


AUSTIN: Pro, we can do this show—


KEITH: Well, I think it’s funny, so pro. 


AUSTIN: —that helps us pay our rents. 


JACK: Pro. 


AUSTIN: Pro. 


KEITH: Cross off all the cons. 


[Austin laughs]


JACK: Con: working is tiring. 


AUSTIN: Working is tiring, con. Pro, if I work I can sleep at night. 


ART: Oh.


JACK: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Otherwise, I can’t, ‘cause my brain doesn’t work. Um, alright, let’s do a clap. Forty-five? 


JACK: Yep.


KEITH: Yep.


[pause, followed by claps]


JACK: Yeah, that was great.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: I’ll tell you what I don’t like about new time.is. Is when at forty-four, the fours touch.


AUSTIN: Yeah, I just noticed that too! My fours touch!


SYLVIA: What’s wrong with that? They’re being affectionate.


AUSTIN: Let fours touch!


SYLVIA: Yeah. 


JACK: Four is my favorite number.


SYLVIA: It’s only gay if the fours touch.


AUSTIN: [laughs] Okay. Oh, is that how—


SYLVIA: Sorry. 


AUSTIN: Alright.
