Clapcast 70: How Many Powers Can We Name?
Transcriber: Nico (QueerlyDeparted#5059)
Austin: How of the—huhkay. [laughing] How many of the powers can we name? These are categories of superhero power.
Jack: Okay, in the MMO…
Austin: Mmhm.
Jack: [cross] Uh DC Universe Online.
Austin: [cross] In the MMO DC Universe Online. Correct.]
Austin: Also everyone should be recording.
Jack: Yes.
Art: Well, I just started recording so maybe we should say again that we’re trying to guess [cross] all the power sets in DC Universe Online. 
Austin: [cross] Yes. There are 15. Yeah.
Art: Of which you tell me six were available at launch. See what I remember is that you had to pick a mentor, and that’s probably not the same thing. I remember that you had to pick like [Austin: I—]  Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman or like their evil counterparts. Let’s call them Lex Luthor, the Joker, and [deep breath] whatever Wonder Woman villain they come [Austin: Yeah?] into the yard with that…Circe?
Austin: Y’know what? I think that you’re—correct, you nailed that. You literal— That’s all six. And you’re right, those mentors um are all tied to I guess a power ty— at launch those three were set—each of those were 3 different power sets. And it looks like those have maybe been, like, spread out from there maybe a little bit? I’m trying to figure out where—
Art: Okay it’s tricky there cause like Batman isn’t a superpower set.
Jack: No.
Austin: No but he did have a category which is the same category as Lex Luthor, no, sorry— [Jack: Technology.] it was the same category— it was tech.
Art: Tech, sure.
Austin: Correct.
Jack: Wow I haven’t even played this.
Austin: He and Joker were tech mentors. 
Jack: Okay that’s bullshit.
Austin: Wait, why?
Jack: I don’t— well, the J— [sigh] Okay I suppose the Joker is very tech focused— [cross] but I feel like —
Austin: [cross] Oh, I see what the situation is. Go ahead.
Jack: The kind of tech that he uses is so different to Batman’s that I would not even consider them the same thing. 
Austin: [cross] Okay well let me explain what the mentor—
Jack: [cross] The Batman has got like a stealth bomber.
Austin: Right, right.
Jack: And the Joker has chattering teeth that are bombs.
Art: [cross] Yeah but you can just like reskin the same things, y’know.
Austin: [cross] That is exactly the vibe.
Austin: Well this is the thing to understand. Okay so mentors give you your missions, but they also are associated with a particular power origin. [Jack: Huh.] The thing to understand is that powers have power origins, which means that for instance: name me another power type.
Art: Ummm, there must be like a magic one.
Austin: Right. Well so no, magic—
Art: But magic is an origin. 
Austin: Is an origin. Exactly.
Art: Ohhh. [cross] So like fire, you could have like—
Austin: [cross] Whereas fire is the… 
Art: Fire magic, fire tech.
Austin: Tech. And fire, what’s the third category?
Art: Ummm. Uhhh, whatever Superman is?
Austin: Whatever Superman is.
Art: But it also has to be Lex Luthor? So it’s—
Austin: Uh-huh.
Art: What do those two have in common?
Jack: Uh, power [laughs].
Art: Um.
[brief silence]
Austin: There’s a word for this in DC, Art. You know what this is.
Art: It’s like  meta.
Austin: It’s meta. 
Art: But that’s not really Lex Luthor, [Austin: It’s not.] but I could see Lex Luthor being like the head of evil metas, right?
Austin: Mhmm. Mhmm. Mhmm. That is exactly it.
Jack: What do they mean when they say “Meta” in the DC Universe?
Art: A metahuman.
Austin: [cross] Which, which, by which they mean a superhuman. They mean a mutant.
Jack: [cross] And that’s a specific sort of—
Austin: They mean a superhuman.
Art: Yeah has superpowers. [laughs]
Austin: Has superpowers.
Jack: I see. Oh I see. That isn’t uh magic. Like witches would be magic [Austin: Correct.] and Superman would be meta.
Art: Right. Or like Mr. Freeze is tech. Killer Frost [Austin: Correct.] is a meta.
Austin: Correct. So, that’s another one. Classic. Ice! 
Art: Okay ice—
Austin: Fire power, ice power, that’s two. 
Art: And there’s four more?
Austin: Four more classics, and then a bunch more marketplace powers.
Jack: Uh, plants. Like nature.
Austin: Nature, got it.
Art: Nature sure.
Austin: That’s another classic. 
Art: Ummm. Fire, ice, nature, ummm.
Austin: Mmhm.
Art: What about just sort of like yellow? Y’know like [laughs]
Jack: [laughs] I’m sorry?
Austin: You mean Green Lantern’s weakness?
Art: Yeah.
Austin: Now I need you to understand there’s another set of things called “Iconic Powers.” And I don’t know if those, is that where “Yellow” might be. No. It’s not.
Art: Or like energy? Does does that like— is that too broad do you think?
Jack: Oh energy’s a good pick. A good potential pick.
Austin: Energy I believe is too broad. [Art: Okay.] Unless you’re telling me about a specific type of energy.
Art: Fire, ice, nature, ummm. 
Austin: What types of energy are there?
Jack: Electricity.
Austin: That is a marketplace power.
Jack: Okay. [laughs]
Art: I have to pay for electricity?
Austin: You have to pay for electricity. [laughs]
Art: Well I guess I have to pay for electricity in life.
Austin: [still laughing] Yes.
Art: Um, what about like, dark? Like uh— like what if [Austin: Ooh] Like Raven [Jack: Ghost.] from the—
Austin: Okay. Now see here’s where I want to give you something. Cause I think— My suspicion is that Raven is…sorcery. Which [laughs] is not the same as magic.
Art: So I could have, like, sorcery magic but I could also have, like, sorcery tech? I guess that kind makes sense?
Austin: Of course you could! Right?
Art: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah! That’s kinda cool right?
Art: Yeah.
Jack: What is [Austin: I kinda like—] sorcery? Is this the difference between classically like witches and wizards? Of like—
Austin: Sorcery is— Uhhh here I’ll tell you what sorcery is. Sorcery is the move “Summon Guardian: Summon a defensive guardian to damage, stun, and knock down your enemies.”
Jack: Huh.
Austin: “Rejuvenate.” Oh here we go: “Soul Well: You summon a soul well that heals your allies and damages enemies.”
Art: Of course you do.
Austin: Uh, “Transmutation: Blast your target and nearby enemies with a burst of supernatural energy, damaging [laughs] and knocking them down. It inflicts bad karma, making enemies vulnerable to karmic effects.” “Ritualistic Word: These spellbound words will heal you.” Y’know. It’s this shit. “Polymorph.” 
Art: [cross] What about like uh—
Austin: [cross] “Karmic Suspension.”
Art: Like Brain. Like Telekinesis. Like mind.
Jack: Brain powers.
Art: Brain powers.
Austin: Keep going. Mind, there’s another word for it. What’s the word for mind stuff?
Art: Uhhh. [sounds of Art thinking]
Jack: Psychic.
Art: Psychic. 
Austin: Closer. Not right yet. Psychic’s better than what they w—
Art: Like mentalism.
Austin: [claps] Mental! 
Art: Mental sure. Mentalism is the—
Austin: Mental is a classic.
Jack: [laughs] Mentalism is the guesser number.
Austin: So of the classics you have— [laughs] Yes. Fire, ice, mental, nature, sorcery. You’re missing one classic game power, I think you can get it immediately.
Jack: Is it a tricky one? No, you think we can get this immediately.
Austin: No I— it’s it’s a classic power.
Jack: Water.
Austin: If you’re making a DC game what is it? What is missing?
Jack: Uhhh.
Art: Well it depends. Because I would think, like, what I’m missing is Batman still. 
Austin: You’re missing Batman. Correct.
Art: But if Batman is tech—
Austin: Right, but what if you needed—
Art: I just want like tech tech.
Austin: Yeah so what’s tech tech? What’s Batman good at?
Jack: Fighting.
Art: Nooo.
Austin: That’s a great answer, wrong. [laughs]
Art: He’s good at like having shit.
Austin: What types of shit does he have?
Art: Like his utility belt stuff. Um.
Austin: What’s on his utility belt?
Jack: [cross] Gadgets!
Art: [cross] Tools.
Austin: It’s gadgets.
Art: Gadgets, okay.
Austin: You got it.
Jack: God the disappointment, the like the like the professorial disappointment in Art’s voice when Austin, you said “What’s Batman good at?” [Austin laughs] and I said “fighting” and Art said “Nooo.” 
[Everyone laughs]
Austin: He is! And he’s good at detective work too. But that’s not his power, his power is gadgets.
Art: Um.
Jack: Is he— yeah. Cause like, my [gets distant from the mic] I’m just getting comfy in my chair. [Austin: Mmhm.] My encounters with Batman have mostly been like the most mainstream Batmans that you can encounter. 
Austin: Mmhm.
Jack: The Nolan movies. I’ve read The Killing Joke. I’ve read, umm—
Jack: [cross] I’ve played all the Arkham games.
Austin: [cross] Have you watched much animated series?
Jack: None. No.
Austin: [disappointed] Ough. Jack.
Jack: I really should.
Austin: Pleeeeeaaaase.
Jack: I feel like you, and I don’t say this as a dig, I welcome it. I feel like you recommend that show to me every [Austin: Every—] three to four months.
Austin: Yeah, 100%.
Art: Wellll.
Austin: Just watch the first season, it’s great. And we need to watch it soon. For reasons.
Jack: Oh yeah we do. But but— Y’know. Yeah.
Austin: Art were you going to say something wrong? Were you going to say don’t watch it? Because—
Art: No. [Austin: Oh.] I was gonna say you should. You should. You should trust your friend Austin.
[Austin and Jack laughing]
Austin: We should just stop doing this and watch that tonight instead.
Jack: The thing that always gets me about the “Batman is the world’s greatest detective” is that in the mainstream media that I see, he— I’ve never really seen him do detective work.
Austin: Detective— yeah, sure.
Jack: He uses gadget— he uses gadgets. Like he follows footprints with gadgets, he can reconstruct a bullet or whatever. Is Batman historically also good at the other— the purported other side of detective work which is like listening to people? And like talking to people as one human being to another?
Art: No.
Jack: And making [Austin: No.] inference— No.
Austin: [cross] He’s got, well. 
Art: [cross] Well, making inferences yes. You you you— the end—
Austin: Making inferences for sure. Interrogating people? Yes. [Art: Mmhm.] Going undercover? Yes. Um, like putting on a fake face and like going down to the docks. Absolutely.
Art: Being Matches Malone. I don’t know if they use that character anymore but Matches Malone used to be [cross] his like criminal alias.
Austin: [cross] Matches Malone for sure. Yes.
Jack: Oh wow he has a cri— that’s very good.
Austin: He is good at listening to people in a certain sense. Uh, especially in material that wants him to be sympathetic to his rogues gallery, umm—
Jack: Oh sure.
Austin: Where he’s understanding their psychology or their trauma to piece together where they might be going next, y’know what I mean? [Art: Mmhm.] But he’s not umm, He’s not Homicide: Life on the Streets, do you know what I mean? [Jack laughs] He’s not um— He’s not peering into the s— I mean I guess he’s kind of peering into the souls of men.
Art: Yeah.
Austin: That’s kind of what he does.
Jack: If if if. If you’re not under his radar he can put you at ease and you feel [Austin: [snickers] No.] like you can give him information or whatever.
Austin: [cross] No. You are not gonna get put at ease.
Jack: [cross] No, he is not that kind of guy.
Austin: He’s pulling it out of you, but he’s not um— He’s putting you at ease if you’re an ally of his and he needs information from you maybe. No he’s never putting you at ease. He’s doing the opposite. He’s sh… He’s shuffling you around. He’s giving you the like— he’s making you slip up.
Jack: Yeah he’s sort of— he’s an unsettling fellow. I’ve gotten that from [cross] the media I’ve seen. Everyone is afraid of Batman. He’s gone [laughs] I looked.
Austin: [cross] He’s behind you right now. He’s gone, he’s gone now. You looked and—
Art: [cross] Yeah.
Austin: You looked and there was—
Jack: I saw a tiny little [woosh noise], there was a woosh sound effect in the— and then the camera cut to a bat flying away. [Austin making noises of agreement]
Art: I’ve gone to the in-game store page on the—
Austin: Well now you’re spoiling yourself.
Art: Well.
Austin: Give me guesses!
Art: I can’t now, I’ve seen them.
Austin: Jack. I need you to keep guessing.
Jack: Okay so I’m now trying to guess other [cross] sort of powers. Electricity was one of them. Okay, let’s—
Austin: [cross] These are now marketplace powers. Some of these you will not get. Yes.
Art: [cross] Yeah. Yes.
Austin: How many more of these, Art, would you say are energies?
Art: Counting or not counting electricity?
Austin: Not counting electricity. On top of that, I’m gonna say four of these are energies.
Art: Yeeesss. I would say four energies is correct [cross] and one of them is uh— is uh— is—
Austin: [cross] And one of them I don’t— [laughs] ]
Art: One you’re just never gonna get. Um. [laughs]
Jack: [cross] Because it’s specifically—
Austin: [cross] I’m really curious if we’re both on— Well—
Jack: Or it’s just deeply weird. Alright I’m gonna—
Austin: You just start guessing.
Jack: I’m gonna cast my net wide. [Austin: Yes] Let’s go gravity.
Art: No.
Austin: No there is—
Jack: Let’s go quantum—
Art: Yes.
Austin: What?! Are you fucking kidding me?!
[Everyone laughs]
Austin: And that’s the gravity one!
[Jack laughing]
Art: Yeah
Austin: Quantum is time and gravity control.
Jack: Was this the one you thought I wasn’t going to get?
Art and Austin: No.
Austin: Well, I think if you’d— if I had— if you got rid of the one I think you weren’t going to get, I would put quantum as the one you wouldn’t get of the remaining group.
Jack: Okay.
Art: Yeah if we were ranking these that would probably be the second lowest.
Austin: No I think— now I think Jack might get the other one because of it being an energy type, but they couldn’t tell you what we mean by it. Does that make sense, Art?
Art: No, now I’m not sure [Jack: Wow.] what you mean. Quantum was my borderline energy one.
Austin: Okay. I do think it’s borderline. We’ll keep going.
Jack: Okay. Death. Um.
Art and Austin: No.
Jack: [thinking noises] I said—
Austin: [cross] You said death’s an energy. Yeah, time is quantum.
Jack: [cross] we said time, we sort of talked about time. Death is absolutely an energy, Austin.
Austin: Mmm no, not in DC.
Jack: Okay [laughs] Okay.
Austin: But you could get to death— I guess you could get to death through another thing here.
Art: You could get to— A lot of these could kill you.
Austin: Oh yeah 100%. But actually death is—
[Art laughs]
Austin: Y’know I was talking shit on death not being an energy, but one of these other energies probably contains death.
Jack: Okay uh entropy. I think that that’s sort of time-based.
Austin: That’s still time, yeah. Think broader. Think about like—
Art: You’re getting a little too granular.
Jack: I’m getting too granular, okay.
Art: Think of what—
Austin: Anything—
Art: Yeah.
Austin: Go ahead, Art.
Art: Think of what would like— think of a superhero you could describe in five seconds.
Austin: And then think of the categories as being a— thirty other superheroes with the same type of power.
Jack: Okay. Speed.
Austin: You know! [laughs] Hey! Where the fuck is speed?
Art: I think that’s a travel power.
Austin: [cross] Ohhh that’s one of the iconic powers, it is.
Jack: [cross] Ohhh. But you could absolutely play that to be a combat thing right?
Jack: Cause as game designers we should always be thinking about how [cross] to use its mechanics for combat.
Austin: [cross] How it’s for combat. Yeah.
Jack: Okay. [Thinking noises] We’ve— we’ve done fire, we’ve done electricity, we’ve done ice. Uh, water is kind of ice.
Art: [cross] Water is not ice.
Austin: [cross] Water is a different one!
Art: Yeah.
Jack: [amused] Water is a different one, okay. 
Austin: Mmhm.
Jack: Okay. Let’s do earth, rocks.
Austin: Earth! Got it!
Art: Earth! Boom.
Austin: These are the classics.
Jack: [Thinking noises] Let’s do uh, earth, water, uh air! Air powers.
Art: No.
Jack: Uhhh no okay.
Austin: Nooo.
Jack: Wind.
Austin: We would’ve led you there with air I think.
[Jack laughs]
Art: Yeah I think we would’ve given you wind with air, we’re not monsters.
Jack: Shit. Okay. Now it’s starting to get— cause we’ve done nature— wha—umm—we’ve done time…
Austin: I think you still have— I would say you still have one or two—[Pauses to think]
Jack: That I could conceivably get.
Austin: —of naturally occurring phenomena-type powers. The— of the type you’re looking at here. You’re talking about earth, electricity. I would say one or two of these— I’d say two of them are elements of the world in that style of way.
Jack: Poison. 
Art: No.
Austin: No.
Jack: That’s bullshit. Um—
Austin: Poison’s of these other ones, nature or something.
Jack: Probably nature. Elements of the world. I feel like I’ve—
Austin: [cross] In a broad way. In the same way that fire— I think this—
Art: [cross] A b— Yeah. I think Austin’s misleading you here.
Austin: I think the top one definitely is.
Art: Uh-huh, yeah.
Austin: And then the one that you and I would understand in a different way than Jack would…
Art: Mmhm.
Austin: Also would be that if it was just the word it is and not just the other meaning of the word that we understand.
Art: Yeah it’s a real shame that the audience of this Clapcast can’t s— [Austin laughs] can’t know what [starts laughing] we’re talking about.
Jack: What we need to do is like the— the thing in where the live audience gets to see the word [Austin: Mmhm.] on the screen before the performers do. 
Austin: Right.
Jack: Um animals. That’s nature [Austin: Mmhm] but I’m just trying out uh like— like wolves and shit—
Austin: Yeah
Jack: [cross] You know, one of nature’s many [stops talking to laugh] powers.
Austin: [cross] Wolves and shit. Yeah.
Art: I think “wolves and shit” has to be under nature.
Jack: Yeah. Um. [Silence] Uh— uh— underground. No, that’s earth.
Austin: That’s earth. That’s earth.
Jack: Ummm and it’s not time. Oh what— there’s the seasons!
Art: No.
Austin: That’s nature.
Art: Um let’s— let’s— ummm— [Austin: You wanna—] what was going on when a lot of superheroes were being created?
Austin: Good. Good.
Jack: War. War was happening.
Art: [cross] Uh—huh. What kind of— Yeah you can get a couple through this.
Austin: [cross] Okay! You could do a couple with this.
Jack: Well it was like— uh— the First and Second World Wars. Y’know like the— the great introductions of mechanized  large scale warfare.
Austin: Okay.
Art: Yeah.
Austin: What type of superheroes would have come out of that context?
Jack: [pause] Uh uh— deeply patriotic propagandistic superheroes. [laughs]
Art: I’m gonna give you that one I think [laughs]
Austin: You’re gonna give that for the one that starts with “M?” [cross] Is that the one you’re trying to get?
Art: [cross] Yeah, I would give that one, yeah.
Jack: [amused] What— what have I got? [laughs]
Austin: I’m— okay it starts with “M.” What do you think World War 2 superhero— [Jack: Mirage.] —power— That’s fun no, but that’s fun. I love that idea. 
Jack: Ummm.
Austin: Think more basic. Again you’re thinking about a big category of heroes that all use the same thing to kill people [laughs] because that’s basically what—
Jack: Machine guns.
Art: [cross] Yeah ding ding ding.
Austin: [cross] I’ll give you machine guns. Munitions.
Jack: Wooow I cannot believe this! I thought about guns earlier as an option and I disc— I— I— I threw it out because I thought “No of course it won’t be guns!”
Austin: Oh now [Jack: Munitions.] it’s important to remember you’re playing a— you can make a hero or a villain, right? So munitions is there, there are plenty of heroes who use guns in DC. But you also have to think: villains. And there’s lots of villains what have a machine gun or something.
Jack: Oh people shoot guns in DC comics and properties constantly [Austin: Constantly.] in my understanding of it.
Austin: Constantly.
Jack: It’s what happening most of the time, right?
Austin: [cross] Yeah. Now— now—
Art: [cross] That’s when you got some guys trying to shoot Superman so the bullets can bounce off his chest.
Jack: [cross] —[unintelligible] clapcast. [Mark at 16:23]
Austin: Exactly. Now Art was trying to lead you somewhere else though, also, here.
Art: Yeah.
Jack: Oh, by talking about the war? By talking about the—
Jack: [cross] —First and Second World Wars?
Austin: [cross] The war and— and where— Yes.
Art: [cross] And the aftermath of the war. You should really understand—
Art: —that— that— the Golden Age is during the two World Wars, but the Silver Age is after.
Jack: Is during the Cold War?
Art: Yeah.
Austin: Mmm. Mmm. Mmhm. Mmhm.
Jack: The C— Oh, subterfuge. Uhhh—
[Art and Austin laughing]
Austin: I love that answer! But no!
Art: Great answer, it’s not right.
Austin: Again, be more basic. Su— Uh— Comic book writers—
Jack: Lies.
Austin: [amused] What did you say?
Jack: [cross] Lies. Lies. Nuclear energy, nuclear weapons.
Austin: [cross] No, no no no no. We— Nuclear—
Austin: Nuclear energy! 
Art: Yeah. 
Art and Austin: Atomic—
Austin: —is the one that you’re [Jack laughs] looking for here.
Jack: [still laughing] “Subterfuge.”
Austin: Subterfuge is very funny, but what you’re looking for is atomic.
Jack: Mmm.
Austin: So these are moves like “Geiger Blast” and “Neutrino Blast” and “Nuclear Burst” and “Radiation Burn.” [laughs]
Jack: Wow. Nice!
Austin: And “Neutron Bomb.” Uh—huh!
Jack: All deeply real things that uh— uh— 
Austin: [cross] Oh here there’s also— here’s a good one. Uh—huh.
Jack: [cross] Well I suppose guns are also real. [laughs]
Austin: “Density: Increase your molecular density and transmute your body into extremely fortified metal for a short time, allowing you to absorb incoming damage.” Uhhh you take—
Art: Oh is this the tank spec?
Austin: It’s a tank spec, yeah.
Art: Wow!
Austin: That’s kinda fun.
Art: Yeah.
Austin: Or at least that might be a tank sub-spec, y’know.
Art: Yeah.
Austin: Oh! Y’kn— yeah there’s other stuff— yeah it does have the tank role, so yeah that makes sense— oh it also has a damage role, it has both.
Art: We haven’t reached the powers that I’d be most excited to play yet but—
Austin: We’re gettin’ there.
Art: —atomic is up there.
Austin: We only have three left?
Art: Yeah. Yeees. But these are the three that I think [cross] Jack has no shot.
Austin: [cross] I think Jack can get one of these three.
Jack: Steampunk shit. That’s sort of munitions but.
Art: [cross] I think that’s gadgets.
Austin: [cross] I think that’s gadgets.
Jack: Ahhh fuck. Okay.
Austin: Ummm, think broader, okay? Think about what do people— what do people say about superheroes a lot?
Jack: They…are…representative of the best things that we can be.
Austin: You could get there from that.
Art: You could get there from that.
Austin: You could get there from that. Um, you could also get there from another thing people say about superheroes. Superheroes, they say, people talk shit about superheroes and then someone inevitably says, “Now wait a second! Superheroes are the latest in the long line of human invention. [Jack: Huh.] They’re just like blank.”
Jack: Medieval knights. [Austin: No.] Chivalric knights.
Austin: [mumbling] No that’s not— no that’s not what they say. [cross] No one says “Captain America—” [breaks off laughing]
Art: [cross] No one says that.
Jack: Tanks.
Austin: No they say this in like a— in like a way of gaining prestige for the superhero. “Dontcha know, superheroes are just modern day…”
Jack: Fairytales.
Austin: Sure. So think about that space, the space of belief in myth. [Jack laughs] And characters d— coming from that direction. Or the best thing that we can be. Like you said earlier.
Jack: Ideal. Uh, uh, m—m—morals. Virtue.
Austin: Mmm.
Art: You’re very close.
Austin: Gettin’ there. You’re very close. Think more literal, think more basic [laughs].
Jack: Goodness. No. Um. Because these might also apply to villains.
Austin: There could be bad guys, yes, correct! Which is I think actually a problem with the name of this power, but I get it.
Art: Yeah, but there’s a lot of synonyms that I would take.
Austin: Yes.
[pause]
Jack: Strength. No.
Austin: [laughing] No but that’s close to another one! So!
[Jack laughs]
Jack: Oh God. Okay, okay. The— there’s sort of— they’re— they have this sort of folkloric aspect. They have this mythical aspect. [Austin: Mmhm.] Uh, gods! God powers.
Art: Yeah.
Austin: I’m gonna give you this, yes. “Celestial.”
Jack: Woah. [cross] I wouldn’t’ve—
Austin: [cross] “Divine blessings or unholy rituals.”
Jack: Yeahhh. Great.
Austin: Mmhm. Mmhm. These are things of course like “Admonish.”
Jack: Oh sure, these are sort of like, paladin powers. Or cleric powers.
Austin: And “Malediction: Torment your target with a bolt of dark energy!” This is where dark stuff is, by the way.
Jack: [cross] Oh huh yeah, we talked about that stuff earlier.
Austin: [cross] And light stuff. Well…fuck.
Jack: Oh was the last one light? [laughs]
Austin: Light is— there is a light one yeah. Ummm, do you know why Art and I keep saying, that like, you’re not gonna get this one?
Jack: No, why?
Austin: Cause it doesn’t mean what you thi— what do you think light powers are?
Art: [amused] Yeah.
Jack: I think light powers are…I mean they’re one of two things, right? [Austin: Mmhm.] They’re either about manipulating light, y’know blinding powers [Austin: Yeah.] flashbang powers, um a sort of kind of pale holy fire, y’know [Austin: Right, right.] rather than like a fire power. But like a— like a bright corona [Austin: Mmhm.] eating somebody up. Or…light here is like a moral judgment. [Austin: Mmm.] They’re talking about light powers as being, um— uh— or it could also be like dextrous, or— or— or lightweight—
Jack: [cross] Moving very quickly and floatily, y’know?
Austin: [cross] Okay can I read you [laughs]
Austin: Art do you have the list of powers in fron— the— the like— sub-powers in front of you or is that all in the Wiki?
Art: Oh no the sub-powers— [Austin: Okay.] I’m looking at iconic powers right now. 
Austin: [cross] Okay well let me re—
Art: [cross] Which is hilarious to me right now.
Austin: Let me read uh two different light powers here. Um— uh— and I’m gonna try to read one that’s like— okay, so, here’s one. “Recharge your teammate: Instantly revitalize your group’s three most fatigued members, restoring power.”
Art: Sure.
Jack: Sounds about what I was expecting.
Austin: Okay. Okay. Haa— here’s one that’s probably also still similar to what you’re expecting. “Light Barrier: Surround yourself in a light shield that frees you from control effects and prevents incoming damage.”
Art: Mmhm.
Austin: That sounds like what you thought? Um, would you say this next one is? Is what you thought? Uh, “Construct combos are a specific weapon combo that activates other light powers after the initial cast of certain light powers. Combo damage is based on might.” And here are the sub—combo power types for this construct combos. Cause these are all different sub—construct [someone goes pfft] light moves. “Light claws” that’s still li— okay it’s claws made of light, you get that right?
Jack: Mmhm.
Art: Mmhm.
Jack: Oh yeah! Fair enough.
Austin: “Ram,” like you’re ramming someone with light. Okay. “Minigun.” 
Jack: [laughs] Okay, well.
Austin: “Im—” uh— uh— “Boxing.”
[Jack’s responses become increasingly incredulous]
Jack: Boxing?
Austin: Uh—huh. “Baseball.”
Jack: Oh.
Austin: “Chainsaw.”
Jack: Okay. [cross] What the fuck does this mean?
Austin: [cross] “Lightweight.”
Art: [amused] “Grasping hand.”
Austin: [amused] “Grasping hand.” Yup. Uh—huh. “Snaptrap.” “Hand clap.” Can you picture this now? What are you picturing as I read these things?
[pause]
Jack: Like…now I’m picturing, like, silly little pranks, kind of.
[Austin and Art laugh]
Austin: Um. I’m gonna read “Chainsaw.” “Leap at your enemies with a giant chainsaw, damaging them. This attack may panic enemies.”
Jack: Is this constructing things out of light?
Austin: It is. Who does this?
Jack: Ummm… [Waffling noises]
Austin: I’m sorry you’re in this— You’re— We have put you through a gauntlet in the last two days, Jack.
Jack: I know, I know! What was the last one? 
Jack: [cross] What was the last—
Austin: [cross] Hunter x Hunter.
Jack: Oh! [laughs] Hunter x Hunter! That’s true.
Austin: [cross] This is the same. This is American Hunter x Hunter pod.
Jack: [cross] This is— this is really stretching the limits of my interpretive powers.
Art: Yeah.
Jack: What is— who makes weapons out of light? Is this someone I know?
Austin: It’s a big— it’s a big important person inside of the DC c— a like category of hero inside DC.
Art: Had a movie!
Austin: Had a movie!
Jack: Are these the fucking Eternals?
Art: [amused] No.
Austin: [cackling in the background and clapping]
Art: Great guess. Great try.
Austin: You know there’s like a cosmic element!
Art: Uh—huh.
Jack: Oh. Oh. Right. Is this the— the Lanterns?
Art: Yes.
Art: [cross] This is Green Lantern.
Austin: [cross] It is the Green Lanterns. Yes. And the Sinestro Corp—
Jack: [cross] Oh so light.
Austin: —who is yellow. That is yellow power.
Jack: What does it mean when you say yellow? Why is Green Lantern’s weakness yellow? Is that just—
Austin: One of the Green Lanterns had a weakness to yellow. [Jack: Seeing it or—] It was only one of them, right?
Art: [amused] Well it depends. It really depends how far down the—
Austin: Cause I know another one had wood. Wood was a weakness for—
Art: [cross] Wood was a weakness for the Golden Age Green Lantern. When they brought him back the— it was yellow.
Jack: [cross] Wood?!
Austin: [cross] For the Golden Age one. Hal Jor— was it Hal? Right.
Art: And then they sort of, like, built this whole thing where like…
Austin: And then there’s a million rings during like the…late 2000s right?
Art: Yeah but in like— before that they had like the yellow imp— th— th— the yellow impurity and then they were like “Well the yellow impurity represents fear.” [Austin: Mmm. Mmhm. Mmhm.] And— and so on and so forth.
Austin: Right, because the green represents courage, right?
Art: Will, but yeah.
Austin: Wiiiiilllllll. Wiiilll. The courage was a different ring, presumably.
Jack: So what are the Lanterns— what are some of the things Lanterns are weak to nowadays?
Art: [pause] Yellow. [laughs] Still, I think.
Jack: [laughing] Oh yellow still? Okay.
Austin: They went back to yellow, is that true?
Art: I think. Or maybe it’s nothing, maybe they got rid of yellow.
Austin: “Originally power rings were unable to affect objects colored yellow, though Lanterns typically found ways around this by indirect manipulation.” Sure. Sure.
Art: [cross] And then so S—
Jack: [cross] So only if—
Austin: [cross] Fun, this is fun.
Art: Sinestro, the big Green Lantern villain, had a power ring that made yellow objects.
Austin: Right.
Jack: Woah.
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: So if I got shot with a normal color weapon, no problem. If I got shot with a yellow weapon, a yellow bullet—
Austin: No no no, you’d get shot, you would die. If you were a Green Lantern, and someone just shot you?
Jack: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah you’d get shot.
Jack: Oh okay.
Art: No that’s not true, because the Green L— the ring has a passive ability to protect you from lethal harm. 
Austin: Ohhh I didn’t realize that.
Art: If someone shot you the ring would automatically save you. [Austin: Interesting.] But yes the yellow bullet would pass through [Austin: Yeah.] and kill you.
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: Huh.
Austin: If I was asleep would the ring protect me?
Art: Yeah.
Austin: [cross] That’s cool.
Jack: [cross] Yeah the rings don’t sleep.
Austin: Huh.
Jack: The rings only sleep in the sleeping ring dimension.
Austin: Right sure yeah. [Art: Yeah.] Sorry I missed that one. Alright, there’s one more left, and you were already kind of close to it with “Strength.”
Jack: Might.
Austin: This is o— no. This is the one where they’re, like, not just saying the regular word. They’re juicing it up by making it emotional.
Art: Mmhm.
[pause]
Jack: P—
Austin: And I don’t even really— Oh this is another Lantern thing.
Art: This is another Lantern thing, yeah.
Austin: Fuck off.
Jack: Virtue. No. Uh, stre— uhhh. Mi— It’s not might. It’s not power. I need to be more emotional than this?
Austin: More emotional.
Art: Yeah.
Jack: What are some single word [laughs] nouns that I could use here?
Art: [cross] Picture a full ROY G BIV spectrum of Lantern’d words.
Austin: [cross] I’m gonna give you a picture—
Austin: I’m gonna send you a picture here. Uh, this I don’t think answer— helps you answer this at all—
Austin: [cross] —but it’s a very funny picture.
Jack: [cross] Okay I’m excited to see it.
Art: [laughs]
Jack: Okay so what we have here, what Austin has sent me here, is a picture of— This is a screenshot of— uh— [laughs] —someone from an MMO standing in what looks like a star destroyer from Star Wars. [Austin and Art laugh] Wearing chains, uh— a vest, uh…a red jacket and just thi—
Art: Impeccable fit by this person.
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: [laughs] Jus— jus—
Austin: I have to tell you— I’ll re— the— th— I’m not gonna say the name of it, but it’s “Dre” then “—Blood” then “— ‘the name of the power’” then “—DCUO.jpg.” What if this was made by Dre? What if this is Dre’s OC?
Jack: Wow.
Austin: It’s an impeccable fit.
Art: Yeah.
Jack: But it’s not blood.
Austin: It’s not blood. But think about it: it’s a red colored thing. [Jack: Anger.] Video games— Anger, rage.
Art: It’s rage.
Jack: Ohhh.
Art: And rage gets you access to abilities like “Plasma Wretch” and [Jack and Austin laugh] “Severe Punishment.”
Austin: “Severe Punishment” is great!
Jack: God! Me when I’m lying on the sofa and I don’t want to get up, then I am the Plasma Wretch.
Austin: What do you think “Severe Punishment” does? Cause it’s not what I thought this would d— it’s not this.
Art: Ummm.
Jack: “Severe Puni—” it’s just a damage over time thing.
Austin: “You gain +10% control resistance and become enraged, healing back a portion of damage taken for 8 seconds, after which you suffer from rage crash, causing all healed damage to instantly return.”
Art: Ah, this spec is too complicated for me.
Jack: Oh weird.
Austin: This is another [Jack laughs] tank or damage spec, but like why the fuck would “Severe Punishment” be a damage reduction, like, thing?
Art: No, I don’t know. It feels like they had the ability name and then like rebalanced the spec [Austin: Mmhm] and were like “We need to keep the name.”
Jack: Oh I fully— I bet that’s what happened. Ummm. [Austin: That’s a classic]. It must have been something originally and then— and then eventually got changed.
Austin: God, sometimes I miss playing MMOs [Art laughs] and like thinking about builds and stuff, and then I remember I just don’t have the time, y’know?
Jack: Yeah.
Austin: I really like this part of like being like uh— like when we played Art— you, me, and Janine, played all of— almost all of Old Republic—
Art: 95% of—
Austin: I finished it. Did I tell you I went back and finished my hero’s thing?
Art: Yeah.
Austin: I beat that fuckin’ emperor.
Art: Great.
Austin: So. Y’know.
Jack: Which emperor?
[Art laughs]
Austin: Oh my God. Well it’s—
Jack: It’s not Palpatine, right?
Art and Austin: No.
Austin: It’s— it’s not.
Jack: Oh cause it’s the Old Rep— It’s the olden times.
Austin: It’s the Old Republic, and it’s not even— and it turns out it’s not even really that guy. There’s some wild ass lore.
Art: What?! It’s not really that guy?!
Austin: It’s— have you not read— have you not done this…
Art: No.
Austin: If I could take off for a month and just play the rest of this with you I would totally do it. Ummm. The guy turns out to have been like an extension of another guy that was tied to that big expansion that they did. With, like, you go off— you go to the— you go to the dark part of the galaxy [Art: Sure.] and find the, like, secret, hidden, y’know, Reven went off—
Art: Yeah. Yeah.
Austin: You go find that place eventually.
Art: Reven’s dark galaxy.
Austin: Yeah, uh—huh. Yeah. Yes. [Art: Wow.] It’s the place called, um. I forget what it’s actually called. But it was like a key part of one of the big expansion places. Y’know. Anyway.
Jack: Oh so they do resolve it in that expansion. You’re not left with the— [Austin: I don’t know—] Oh you’re saying that like— 
Austin: I’m s— so at the end of—
Jack: You thought you’d killed him, but then you laterally learned that that was not actually the case.
Austin: Even at the time, you’re sort of like, “Now wait a second. This feels like— it’s not— This feels like there’s more going on here.” There’s an immortal emperor. At the beginning of— at the beginning of the Old Republic, it’s set up that there’s someone called “The Immortal Emperor,” who um— there’s a sort of like, Anaander Minaai thing happening, Jack. Where it’s like “How could this person continue?” This person seems like there’s no way to beat them. [Jack: Right.] There’s rumors of them having been, y’know, fallen and nevertheless they’re always fucking come back. And you end up confronting them in a big one-on-one duel, and etc. But, uh, at the end of the day, it turns out that actually they’re off— the real version of them is off somewhere else basically. And is like a completely different look and vibe [Jack: Oh weird] it’s very weird.
Jack: So it’s not even like the satisfaction of like the Emperor Calus moment, where you realize that you’re fighting a big automata, um…but then the actual Emperor Calus—
Austin: Uh there’s other benefi— I think that it was still a pretty cool fight and then like— I’ve always said the end of the Jedi Knight story is that you become a Jedi Master. Except if you’ve been Dark Sided, like my character was. They refuse to make you a Jedi Master. [Jack: Ohhh that’s great.] And instead they ma— they— you’re like the— now wai— now wait a second, cause it’s great, but they f— but they walked it back. They tell you— the Jedi Masters tell you you’re not a Jedi Master, you’re only a general. So you get the “General” title to attach to your character, instead of the Jedi Master title, um, but they just walked it back and now you get the Jedi Master title.
[Jack laughs]
Art: Those fucking cowards!
Art: [cross] Ohhh my God. Star Wars: The Old Republic developers meet me in the pit!
Austin: [cross] [laughing] It’s sooo cowardly! It sucks so bad!
Jack: That’s so funny.
Austin: [still laughing] Cause it’s sooo cool, the idea that you finish your journey, and the Jedi Master, like— the Jedi Council is like “Great darkness we sense in you. A Jedi Master you’ve not become yet.” [Art: Yeah!] Like that’s the whole thing! [hands fall in lap] Ugh.
Jack: Yeah! But we can use you as a weapon of war. [Austin: Exactly.] General you shall be.
Austin: Yes. Well no the actual thing that happens is one of your— the sol— the like ge— the admirals show up from the army that you’ve been working with the whole game and is like “I don’t care about this Jedi shit. This person’s a hero. I’m making them a general.” It’s great.
Art: Oh I’ve never been this mad [Austin and Jack laugh] at Star Wars before. Oh! This is what all those jerks must have felt at The Last Jedi. [Austin and Jack laugh more] This is my Last Jedi. [Jack: Art said “you’re right.] I’m gonna be on YouTube—
Austin: I think in many ways this is the inverse of The Last Jedi for many reasons—
Art: Well sure.
Austin: —Beginning with the people mad at The Last Jedi were mad that it was like— that it was like too mean to the Jedi. [laughs] So…
[Everyone sighs]
Jack: Yeah.
Austin: Alright. We should do a podcast.
Art: Oh my God. Okay.
Austin: We—
Jack: I mean we should do the podcast we’ve signed up to do. We have been doing a podcast.
[Art laughs]
Austin: You’re right, we— we did— we just did another different podcast for 45 minutes or whatever. 30 minutes.
Art: Ohhh—
Austin: Yeah it sucks, dude.
Art: This is BioWare right?
Austin: Yeah. Uh—huh.
Art: Fucking—
Jack: Whole vibe is off now.
Art: —Cowards!
Jack: We gotta— [laughs] We gotta take some— [Art: Cowards.] amendatory actions.
Austin: Alright. Time.is? 
Jack: Let’s do it.
Austin: Uhhh, 15?
Art: Yeah.
[silence]
