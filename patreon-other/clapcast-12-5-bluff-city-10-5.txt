Transcriber: thedreadbiter


SYLVIA: Oh, shit, I forgot to save it, um. Someone I follow on Twitter posted like a screencap of an old like—I think it was just an old lucha show? It could have been in Japan, but it was definitely like an old like tape someone scanned of masked wrestlers dressed as C3PO and R2D2?


ALI: Whaaa—[laughs]


SYLVIA: Yeah.


ALI: [quietly] I need to see.


SYLVIA: It might have been at one of the Space War shows actually, [ALI: Wha—excuse me? [laughs]] that they did in Japan. Yeah, hold on. Um. I think it’s Michinoku Pro does a thing called the Great Space War.


ALI: God…


SYLVIA: And—yeah, it was Michinoku Pro—yeah! Okay, hold on. I got them.


[ALI makes a noise]


[pause]


Oh, fuck. Okay. This image is—is pretty powerful. It’s a YouTube thumbnail, but it’s a good one!


ALI: [truly awestruck] Wow!!


SYLVIA: Yeah.


ALI: Wow. Where’s this video, though? [laughs]


SYLVIA: Uh, hold on. [cross] It’s like an hour long.


ALI: [cross] Where do I get that shirt?


SYLVIA: But I will link it.


ALI: Where the fuck do I get that shirt?

SYLVIA: Oh, the entrances are at the beginning, and they come out to the Star Wars theme!


ALI: Oh!


SYLVIA: Oh, I forgot how good [ALI: Wow…] Michi Pro is.


[laughs near-silently]


ALI: Wow…


SYLVIA: [continues laughing quietly]…[cross] This is so good…I love the dude playin Yoda!


ALI: [cross] This is soo good. This is sooo good.


SYLVIA: [laughs softly] Oh…


ALI: [cross] Oh, wow…


AUSTIN: [cross] One second.


ART: Wrestling has a long history of all of this, [ALI yelps in surprise and laughs] though. I mean…


ALI: R2 is killing it with the posture. Let me tell you!


SYLVIA: I swear to god [AUSTIN: So fuckin illeg…] nobody gets comedy in wrestling like the fuckin Michinoku Pro guys, [ALI: God…] because it’s always the dumbest shit every time I see it. I—


ALI: This is soooo good.


SYLVIA: I have very limited exposure, I will say, though. But like…there’s some pretty good fuckin comedy acts there.


AUSTIN: What—is this—is this legal?


[ALI and SYLVIA laugh]


ALI: Yeah…


ART: What is Jerry Lawler who just had the Ninja Turtles working in Memphis?


ALI: Oh my god…I fucking need that shirt.


AUSTIN: Is that—[ALI laughs] why do they have the Star of David on them?


[ALI snorts and laughs]


SYLVIA: Oh, what?


ALI: Do they?


SYLVIA: I’m behind you guys.


AUSTIN: I jumped ahead five minutes.


SYLVIA: Oh. There’s like an Ultraman guy.


ALI: Oh wait, I’m waiting for the…who are they fighting against?


SYLVIA: S—oh! Those are the Brahmin brothers. All I know about them as that they tag with a wrestler I really like who brings a gun to all his matches.


AUSTIN: Who does what?


SYLVIA: He brings a g—a fake gun to his matches. His gimmick is [AUSTIN: God damn.] that he’s like a Die Hard cop, basically, but he’s like a schlubby dude, and he—it’s always hidden in his tights super obviously. My favorite one was he pulled out the pistol and pointed it at someone and they slapped it out of his hand, and then he just pulled this big super-conspicuous shotgun out of his crotch and tried pointing it at them! [sighs] It’s really good.


AUSTIN: Wait, what music is this? Why do I know this music? 


Mm…? Who’s comin out next, wait!


SYLVIA: Oh boy.


AUSTIN: [dismayed] Okay, right. It’s [SYLVIA: Yeah!] E.T.


[SYLVIA laughs quietly]


But it’s E.T. pushing a bike with E.T. in it.


ALI: [cross] I love Ready Player One.


SYLVIA: [cross] Yeah, I don’t know what the fuck is going on here.


[AUSTIN laughs gleefully]


SYLVIA: Oh my god.


[ALI laughs]


Oh…


ALI: God…


AUSTIN: Is this the anime [laughs] doctor you were thinking of?


[SYLVIA snorts]


That’s E.T. It’s E.T. Okay!


ALI: Oh my god [cross] there’s a concert at the bac.


SYLVIA: [cross] I love that he’s got an E.T. with this.


Oh my god.


AUSTIN: This is a lot. 


SYLVIA: [cross] It’s a lot, yeah.


ALI: [cross] Trap is there just dismantling? that’s so funny. 


I’m gonna spend an hour watching this. [laughs] Afterwards…


AUSTIN: What is the—[sighs] 


SYLVIA: Oh no, this is a—yeah, this is a death match! I should mention [AUSTIN: Oh!] [ALI snorts] that. This is like a hardcore match.


[ALI laughs and claps]


AUSTIN: Someone—Superman is being pinned by the crotch with a big piece of luggage, and I think this man is about to hit the luggage with a bowling ball. Oh my god!


SYLVIA: Oh, okay! Um. At about like—


AUSTIN: Oh, but he’s Superman! It doesn’t matter! 20:30. Go to 20:30.


DRE: Okay!

SYLVIA: Um. During [AUSTIN: 20:25.] one of the entrances, you can see the guy I mentioned earlier who brings out the gun, because he is wearing a hard hat with a big like police siren [amused] on top of it!


[DRE snorts and laughs]


AUSTIN: Oh great. Like Die Hard.


DRE: Man.


SYLVIA: Yeah, like Die Hard!


AUSTIN: I like that there are only like…two hundred people here.


SYLVIA: God, dude…[laughs quietly]


[DRE laughs]


[cross] C3PO just tried to—C3PO—


AUSTIN: [cross] [mumbling] it just…Oh, the gun’s here!


SYLVIA: Okay. C3PO tried to um, bodyslam…


DRE: Oh, the cop’s here.


SYLVIA: …E.T., and then E.T. pulled out his finger and made it glow while pointing at him, and now C3PO and R2D2 are both being like controlled by it.


[DRE laughs]


AUSTIN: Wow. He’s a hacker!


ALI: Mm.


SYLVIA: [recovering] Oh…


DRE: Oh, this is nice everybody’s carrying around Superman like he’s flying now.


AUSTIN: Oh, I can extreeemely see this penis.


[DRE snorts]


SYLVIA: There’s—yeah.


DRE: Uh-huh!


AUSTIN: Oh my g—wait.


ART: Everyone’s recording, right? [laughs]


ALI: Mm-hm.


SYLVIA: Oh, of course!


DRE: Yeah, I am.


AUSTIN: They just made Superman eat ass!


[Loud laughter]


But Superman is immune to eatin ass, it turns out! He just wiped his damn mouth off!


[ALI and SYLVIA laugh]


ALI: [laughing] What…I’m gonna watch this later…


SYLVIA: [laughing] Oh, fuck…


DRE: Oh wow, you can…yep.


AUSTIN: Yup! Uh-huh! [cross] See? Over there.


DRE: [cross] That’s a dick, right there.


AUSTIN: I’m gonna stop spoilin this.


ALI: Thank you.


SYLVIA: I need to [cross] [inaudible]


AUSTIN: [cross] There’s a shark at one point.


ALI: Thank you.


[DRE laughs quietly]


AUSTIN: [dismayed] Oh boy, the ring—hoo!


[DRE keeps laughing]


Oh my god!


ART: Yo, Superman’s kind of an asshole!


AUSTIN: Yeah! This is—people who watch this video at 37-some minutes in, uh, you’ll get this joke: this is a real ‘deconstruction’ of wrestling. And you’ll laugh at it ‘cause you’ll have heard this joke.


SYLVIA: Oh, that’s—[ALI: Mm.] that’s pretty good.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm.


ALI: Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: Oh my—[laughs quietly]


DRE: [cross] Ah. Yeah, okay. Yeah.


AUSTIN: [cross] This is very good.


SYLVIA: [laughing] This is—[sighs] this and the…


AUSTIN: This is incredible.


SYLVIA: Another—


AUSTIN: I need to stop doing this.


SYLVIA: There’s another really good one that you can probably find—actually, it’s probably not up anymore ‘cause they have their own streaming service, but DDT did a thing where Kota Ibushi just went through an apartment building and wrestled a bunch of [ALI starts laughing] people in their rooms? 


[DRE laughs]


It was [AUSTIN: Very good.] the fucking best shit! ‘Cause he goes in one room and there’s a dude just getting whipped by a dominatrix? And then he fights that dude!


[ALI laughs]


[AUSTIN laughs]


ALI: I…


ART: Yo, why is Darth Vader on this team?


ALI: W…


SYLVIA: Star Wars!


[Snorts]


AUSTIN: ‘Cause—yeah.


DRE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: C’mon.


There’s a go-cart. Wh—


DRE: There’s a go cart?


AUSTIN: I lost it. For a split second I saw a go-cart, and it’s just gone now.


SYLVIA: I also…for more good times [AUSTIN: Oh my god!], you can also look up Machine Mummy or Mecha Mummy.


ALI: [high-pitched] Mm…


SYLVIA: Who has wrestled Minoru Suzuki and it’s very—it’s very good.


AUSTIN: For anyone who doesn’t mind being spoiled please go to 58:30 [ALI starts laughing quietly] and just hit play.


DRE: Oh god, this barrel spot is a lot, huh?


AUSTIN: Mm-hm!


ART: Is this one match?


SYLVIA: Oh, is it the one where he puts it on his head?


DRE: Yeah.


SYLVIA: And then there’s a flip—yeah, that’s the…I don’t think Great—oh no, that is Great Sasuke! Yeah. Okay.


AUSTIN: [humming] Mm mm mm mm!


SYLVIA: [realizing] Oh, he’s Batman! That’s what his costume is! Okay.


AUSTIN: Oh, that’s Batman?! [cross] That’s Batman. I see now.


SYLVIA: [cross] It’s ‘cause you don’t—he’s—he’s the wrestler who [DRE: Oh yeah!] Alex Navarro has the mask of?


AUSTIN: Right.


SYLVIA: So he’s got his mask design, but his gear is Batman.


AUSTIN: Gotcha.


DRE: Oh—yeah, 58:30’s a lot, Austin.


AUSTIN: It’s a lot. Oh! Okay.


ART: [lost] So who won?


AUSTIN: We did. [DRE: We—yeah.] Art, we did.


[DRE laughs]


ALI: [laughs] Yep.


DRE: Space.


AUSTIN: [cross] Uh.


SYLVIA: [cross] Okay, so—


AUSTIN: Uh-huh?


SYLVIA: I know—I can’t keep going in on this, but apparently those dudes in the weird purple like smocks that had like a Star of David and then also like some other symbol inside of it are some cult.


ALI: Mm.


AUSTIN: [cross] [laughing] Okay.


DRE: [cross] Okay.


SYLVIA: [cross] That are defending the Earth from the Star Wars characters.


AUSTIN: Ohh, okay!


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: I can get with that.


SYLVIA: With Batman.


DRE: Sure.


AUSTIN: Uh, can you tell me if this is really Bon Jovi?


[ALI laughs]


SYLVIA: Austin, come on. What—yeah. It—[disparaging noise]. They—it’s the Great Space War. They’re gonna get Bon Jovi.


AUSTIN: They’re gonna get Bon Jovi. [cross] Only Bon Jovi could work a crowd like this.


DRE: [cross] No, that’s where they draw the copyright line. They can’t [AUSTIN: [amused] Okay!] play real Bon Jovi.


ALI: Austin, you know wrestling isn’t fake, right?


AUSTIN: [defensive] Yeah, I know, but I couldn’t be sure if this was [DRE laughs] a, like a…what-do-you-call-it band, like a…you know, when they like a band a lot and [cross] make a band?


SYLVIA: [cross] Cover band?


AUSTIN: That wasn’t the word I was going for, [SYLVIA: A tributeband.] [ART: A tribute band?] but yes. A tribute band [ALI: Ohh.] [SYLVIA: Okay.] is what I was going for.


SYLVIA: Oh my god.


ART: They’re doing [AUSTIN: Like wrestling.] the whole song? They’re just doing the whole song.


[ALI laughs]


No one’s gonna do anything. No one comes out.


AUSTIN: No, that’s it!


[ALI laughs slightly]


I love it. Honestly? More power to you. All right, let me get Roll20 open. Oh, what is this game? What are we doin? [sighs]


ART: [cross] This. We’re doing this.


SYLVIA: [cross] Wrestling. Yeah, we’re doing the Great Space War.


AUSTIN: [laughing slightly] Oh, okay!


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Well now it makes sense. [sighs]


ART: Honestly, we wish!


AUSTIN: Yeah. I have good news and I have bad news.


ALI: Mm?


DRE: Mm-hm.


SYLVIA: Uh-huh?


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: The good news is I remember last episode was great.


ART: Uh-huh!

[ALI wheezes a laugh]


DRE: Oookay!


AUSTIN: Bad news is, like, what happened? What did we do?


SYLVIA: Um. So Jake and Faustolfe had their match.


AUSTIN: Right.


ALI: Uh-huh.


DRE: Right.


SYLVIA: [cross] And I think it was the—open challenge for the tag teams, right?


AUSTIN: [cross] We should—should we just—should we do this on call?


ALI: Yeah yeah yeah.


DRE: Oh, should we—yeah, should we go ahead [ALI: Yeah.] and clap [cross] before we do this?


SYLVIA: [cross] Oh yeah! True, true, sorry.


AUSTIN: Yeah. All right, let’s time.is—sorry, I should have…


ALI: No…


SYLVIA: Lemme get to this…


AUSTIN: I was looking at my notes—what happened was I looked at my notes and I realized I had my card order, but things are not—this is wrong now.


[ALI laughs]


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: ‘Cause things changed. And I forget what changed, because I have not had time to listen to that OBS file.


SYLVIA: Like a real mid-2000s wrestling show.


AUSTIN: [snorts quietly] Right. [laughing] Exactly.


ALI: 40?


AUSTIN: Uh, 40?


ALI: Yeah.


[Pause]


[Disjointed clap]


[Pause]

[AUSTIN starts laughing loudly]


DRE: [over laughter] Can I—can I…


SYLVIA: [laughing] It does!


AUSTIN: [laughing] It does!

DRE: That’s it. That’s it. That’s all I’m gonna do. That’s all I’m gonna do. That’s it.


AUSTIN: [flabbergasted] 70! It’s 70! It’s so many episodes!


SYLVIA: It’s too many…


[AUSTIN sighs]


ART: And that’s from people who spend too many episodes doing things!


ALI: Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: We spend a lot of episodes doing things, so.


ART: Surely if you parcel them out as long as a Rick and Morty episode, we’re at like…


[AUSTIN laughs]


a thousand, I think.


[ALI sighs]


My point is, [AUSTIN: Um.] don’t go be mean to McDonald’s employees on our behalf.


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: [tired] Yeah, fuckin—please. And of course, our—the…the Big Dog themself.


[SYLVIA snorts loudly]


Sylvia[1]…Boston Clare. That’s like a Boston crab, I guess?


SYLVIA: Here, I got one. Hey, everybody, it’s me, Pickle Sylvia. Uh.


[The friends slowly explode with laughter]


You can find me on Twitter @captaintrash.


[ALI scream-laughs]


All right, you can…[laughs] You can find my other show @Emojidrome, and I also work for VideoGameChooChoo.com.


[ALI trails off laughing]


[Pause]


[snaps fingers] This is what you’re paying for, everybody!


[ALI starts laughing again]

AUSTIN: Ali Acampuroreso. That’s what it should have been.


SYLVIA: Ooh, that one’s good.


ALI: [snorts] Okay, yeah. Thank you. 


SYLVIA: Mm-hm.


ALI: That’s the best one.


AUSTIN: Thank you.


[ALI sighs]


Anyway, hi! We’re going to continue [ALI snorts and laughs] our game of…Bluff City. [sighs] We’re playing [sighs] World Wide Wrestling, the roleplaying by Nathan D. Paoletta. [laughs slightly]


We’re all a little wired. We’re all a little—we just watched—ah…[DRE laughs] You’ll hear it in the clapcast. Um.


[Everyone sighs]


Deep breaths, everyone.


ART: Or maybe already have heard it? I don’t know how the scheduling for those [DRE: Yeah.] works.


AUSTIN: Fair. Fair.


My, uh—what is—what am I lookin for? I’ve lost my agenda. I’m so—I’m all over the place!


ALI: Do we…are we…[laughs]


[SYLVIA and DRE laugh quietly]


Is this another…let’s just look at jewelry for an hour.


AUSTIN: It might be!


ALI: Okay. ‘Cause it can be.


AUSTIN: But! I can tell you your agenda. I can’t tell you mine. [ALI laughs] Here it is.


ALI: [laughing] Okay!


AUSTIN: My agenda today is to challenge and celebrate the wrestlers, it is to make it look like I had it planned all that way along—planned that way all along. And it’s to entertain the imaginary viewing audience! Easy.


ALI: Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: Um. We should—let’s just talk through, at least, what happened last time, and see where we’re at afterwards, how’s that sound?


ALI: Okay, yeah.


DRE: Sure.


AUSTIN: Um. [amused] Where are we at? What happened last time? Let’s talk through the card. ‘Cause I have my notes, which are about the card I planned. But as is always the case, even when literally the book is like ‘hey, just plan a thing and then walk through it’, the way roleplaying games work is—and this is on purpose—that y’all get to control some of that stuff! Y’all get to break in and we collaborate on a story instead! And so, my card order notes are not accurate, and I’m missing—I don’t know what doc I wrote my updated notes in, but I can’t find it. So. Let’s walk through what happened last time! Um. I remember the show starts with the…the representative Ms. Carlisle from Constitution Sports Entertainment showing—


[15:00]


—up and being like, Hey. We got a contract for whoever is the—biggest perform—the best performer tonight. And then we talked to…[pauses] what’s your full—it’s Illusion? Sea Illusion? That’s not—


ALI: Aqua—


ALI, AUSTIN and DRE: Aqua Illusion.


AUSTIN: Aqua Illusion. I remember Erica Rizzo. My note [ALI: Yes. Yeah.] said Erica Rizzo, but. To Aqua Illusion about you know whether or not she was gonna stay or go, basically, whether or not she was [ALI: Mm-hm.]—she had what it took. And then there was a match. And that match was between…was like—I was throwing that to you, Dre.


ART: Oh.


DRE: Oh, sorry.


AUSTIN: Or was that—yeah, ‘cause that was you and Art, right?


DRE: Yes. Yes.


AUSTIN: Okay.


DRE: Yes yes yes. Um, and—yeah, it ended with a run-in by Monster House? Right?


AUSTIN: Yeah. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.


DRE: And the turn where I ruined your card, at the very beginning [AUSTIN: Yep.] was…Faustolfe is now aligned with Monster House, and so they asked for a tag match with Faustolfe and…oh, which one of the monsters? ‘Cause I wanted King Kong. But I was—


AUSTIN: [cross] Couldn’t be King Kong.


DRE:—[cross] informed that the gorilla is not actually allowed to wrestle. So…


AUSTIN: Right. So was it—we can walk through this. You know, I get like you might not remember all the—


DRE: You think it was Sasquatch?


AUSTIN: It was Mr. Sasquatch?


DRE: I believe it was Mr. Sasquatch.


AUSTIN: It wasn’t Illa Zilla.


DRE: No.


AUSTIN: It wasn’t…Goblin, “a little shitty goblin [DRE laughs] who interferes a lot with really bad facial hair”?


DRE: No. I don’t think it was the Loch Ness Monster.


ART: [cross] This is a really brutal takedown of a spooky goon.


DRE: [cross] Because there isn’t a Loch Ness Monster.


AUSTIN: [cross] Well that’s…there isn’t, anymore.


DRE: Right, yeah.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: And it wasn’t Ghoul “is just a ghoul, basically what if Billy Kidman was a zombie type.”


DRE: Right.


ART: And are we sure it wasn’t Ghoul?


AUSTIN: It could have been Ghoul.


DRE: Maybe it was Ghoul.


AUSTIN: [amused] We should listen to that other podcast we did.


DRE: Maybe.


ART: ‘Cause whoever’s—the people listening to this know.


AUSTIN: Oh, they definitely know! 


DRE: [typing sounds] Let me, uh…


ART: I just remember the Billy Kidman guy getting a lotta…a lotta time.


AUSTIN: [baffled] Did he?


ART: Maybe he was in the match with Man Truck, maybe that’s why I’m…


AUSTIN: He was in the—yes! That’s actually correct.


DRE: Aw, I forgot about Man Truck.


SYLVIA: [cross] How?


AUSTIN: [cross] So, the.


DRE: Oh yeah, I think that’s why he was with me! Because it was him versus Man Truck, and that’s when you ran in. Right, Art?


ART: Yeah.


DRE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: But wait, did Art run in?


DRE: Yeah!


ART: At the end! I didn’t interfere with the finish.


AUSTIN: Okay. You came in afterwards—right, and so it was Sweet Belle Moran, Ghoul and Beaches—there was also Beaches? Beaches was part of the regular house, all up agai—oh…All up against Man Truck. Sorry, I just got…what was that noise? Did everybody hear that noise or was that just me?


ALI: Nope!


ART: I did not hear that noise.


DRE: I heard nothing.


AUSTIN: Oh, I just got a work thing. One second, let me see if this is important. It’s from someone who could be important.


ART: Turns out videogames are over!


[ALI laughs quietly]


AUSTIN: [reluctantly amused] Mm…That’d be—you know what?


[DRE laughs]


SYLVIA: [cross] About time!


ALI: [cross] Walmart leaks 2!


DRE: Some days.


AUSTIN: Honestly? Yeah, that leaked—…God.


DRE: Kay, what were the—was there a big leak today? Was there a hot leak?


AUSTIN: Yesterday. Yesterday.


DRE: Oh.


ALI: [cross] Oh, you didn’t see that?


AUSTIN: [cross] Walmart Canada?


DRE: No, what was [AUSTIN: Oh my god.] the hot leak?


SYLVIA: [cross] Yeah, there was like—


AUSTIN: [cross] Should—I’ll—


ALI: [cross] It was—it was everything, but it was a bunch of shit that was horrifying.


AUSTIN: It was literally everything.


ALI: It was just sequels and shit.


DRE: Okay.


ART: They’ve been working on it for months, and they just tweeted it out.


[ALI snorts and laughs]


AUSTIN: They just tweeted it out, yeah. Uh-huh. Good.


SYLVIA: Fuckin hell.


ALI: Good.


AUSTIN: Um.


[sigh]


God. You heard that was fake, right? I’m mad about that still.


ART: Oh yeah, I di—that happened like right away, that [AUSTIN: Yeah.] someone was like, ‘no, you weren’t!’


AUSTIN: Yeah. Also, Art, you’re so far away from that microphone.


ART: Oh, no, I’m not. I’m just around the side of the microphone…


[quiet laughter]


AUSTIN: Okay.


ALI: Yep.


AUSTIN: That’s been…


DRE: Oh wow. Yeah, that’s a…


AUSTIN: Happening with Danielle. Danielle’s had bad mic situation for the last three weeks, and today finally Rob and I were like, describe where your microphone is compared to your face.


[DRE laughs loudly]


Rob has the exact same microphone, and so he was able to be like, there’s a logo on the front of the microphone! Which direction is that [laughing] pointed?


DRE: [sighs] Listen, I’ve been there.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh!


ALI: That happens.


DRE: I’ve done it.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm! Um. All right, so. I think this work thing is something I can just close…this. Boom. 


Okay. Um. So yeah, there was this fight between Man Truck and those other three. And that was a squash for Man Truck to just be like a strong man, and that is when Jake came out, and was like, hey, you and me, Man Truck?


ART: Yeah. And then I cut an amazing original promo right off the top of my head.


ALI: Mm-hm. Mm-hm!


ART: Groundbreaking, honestly.


ALI: Mm-hm!


ART: Um.


AUSTIN: Oh, right, yeah. Yeah, that was good. I remember that now.


[ALI laughs]


And then. That was it. No, then we…there was…


ART: Yeah, I think we did cut after that, didn’t we?


AUSTIN: Oh—yeah, but there was actually a third thing there is that…there was a championship match that night, that was promoed, that was…


ALI: Me…yeah, okay…


AUSTIN: Black Jack vs Aqua Illusion and what was added was Charlie Cupid? Is that correct?


SYLVIA: I think we were at the point where it was like [clears throat] there was the challenge and then we were the two who could answer it, but we weren’t sure if we were going to? Where we left it, I think that was the cliffhanger we left on? Ali and I being the two, I mean.


AUSTIN: I fully do not remember this.


[ALI laughs]


SYLVIA: I remember it ending on like a, if you guys wanna tag, you will tag for this, but I don’t remember if we actually said…


AUSTIN: Wait—so was there another tag? Because I thought the tag match was…


SYLVIA: I thought there was like a tag title like challenge.


AUSTIN: There—right. Yes. Okay. Yes yes yes yes. So the other tag title challenge came from…um…The Protocol, who are the robots. [ART: Yeah.] SAD8 and TKTK.


ALI: [long laugh] Mm-hm!


AUSTIN: Which is really funny if you know that TKTK is journalism slang for just like filler. Um. ‘Cause I just wrote that. I was like, ah, figure out this other robot name. Later. And I came back and I was like, TKTK is a great name for [ALI and DRE laugh] a Star Wars robot.


Um.


SYLVIA: Well.


AUSTIN: So then yes, so that was an opportunity for you two. Then I—see, now I’m not remembering then exactly what the fuck—‘cause I—was I really booking Jake the Jackal also in a tag match?


ART: Well, it was—it’s not for anything. It’s a grudge tag match.


AUSTIN: Right.


ART: Like the end of Wrestlemania I?


AUSTIN: …Yeah.


[ALI laughs]


SYLVIA: Ooh.


AUSTIN: So then…okay.


ART: One of the first Wrestlemanias there ever was.


AUSTIN: I think we should punt on this until I get to listen to this again. Because my notes have—are so far off on this point.


ALI: Okay.


AUSTIN: That I need to listen to it again, [SYLVIA: Okay.] otherwise it’s just gonna be…


SYLVIA: All right!


AUSTIN: Um. A disaster.


ALI: [laughing] Okay.


SYLVIA: We’re saving the Great Space War talk though, right?


ALI: Yes, oh my god. [AUSTIN: Oh yeah.] Exporting this right now. This is going in my clapcast folder. [laughs] Right now.


AUSTIN: That’s what we should save this as. Great-Space-War-name.


[DRE and SYLVIA laugh]


ART: SpaceWar-clapcast-name.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm! Is there other clapcast material we should be doing?


ALI: I…I don’t know. Um.


ART: Oh, um, this isn’t necessarily for the clapcast but um. As you know, I’m leaving for France tomorrow for a two-week trip generously paid for by my mother. And we’re going with a group of old people.


DRE and SYLVIA: Mm-hm.


ART: It’s a—it’s a—


AUSTIN: Is that like, official name?


ART: Uh, the—well, I’m getting to that. The trip [AUSTIN laughs evilly] company—the trip company is called Road Scholar. R-O-A-D.


ALI: Hm!


AUSTIN: [amused] Okay.


ART: Um. Which, yeah, which sounds like sophisticated, right? And like, ooh! Learning! But you have to be 40 or older to buy tickets on these trips?


ALI: Mm.


ART: And the original name for this company is ElderHostel.


ALI: [snorts] [laughs]


DRE: Yeah, that’s the best [SYLVIA: Okay!] sequel. The best movie sequel ever.


[AUSTIN and ALI laugh]


AUSTIN: I love that they brought that movie back, you know?


ART: And I wanna tell you, it is not German, which is what I thought when I heard that name for the first time.


AUSTIN: …Wh—[sighs]


ALI: They hired a marketing guy. That’s fine. [cross] He did his job!


AUSTIN: [cross] H-O-S…


ALI: That’s great.


AUSTIN: Important question.


ART: Yeah huh?


AUSTIN: Debatably. H-O-S-T-E-L? Or.


ART: Yes. Yeah.


AUSTIN: Not H-O-S-T-I-L-E.


ART: No, it’s not hostile to elders.


AUSTIN: [laughs slightly] Are you sure?


ART: [confidently] No. I’m gonna be on an airplane for so long, I leave at 8 a.m. tomorrow and I get in at 9:30 on Sund…[AUSTIN: Mm-hm.] On Saturday, rather.


ALI: Mm.


AUSTIN: And then you have to go to a wedding?


ART: Oh, when we get back I have to go to a wedding.


AUSTIN: That’s too much.


ART: We’re going straight to San Antonio for my sister-in-law’s wedding.


[AUSTIN hisses]


Jess is officiating the ceremony, [SYLVIA: Oh! Fun!] and my whole job that week is making sure that she is not too jet lagged to go to the wedding.


ALI: Mm!


AUSTIN: Oh my god.


ALI: I believe in you.


ART: [cross] Thanks!


AUSTIN: [cross] I do too.


ART: The trick is eating your meals on time.


ALI: Yes!


AUSTIN: What?


SYLVIA: [intrigued] Hm!


ALI: Yes.


AUSTIN: Wait, what do you mean by on time?


ART: Like, you gotta eat breakfast in the morning, and then lunch in the midday, and then dinner when it’s dark.


AUSTIN: How does that prevent ch—jetlag? [cross] Also I said chet lag.


ART: [cross] Because it gets your body on…


AUSTIN: Which is a different thing.


DRE: [cross] Chet lag.


ART: [cross] Chet Lag.


SYLVIA: [cross] That’s a character from Bluff City later.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Yeah. Um. Y’all see Klout’s going away?


SYLVIA: [cross] Yeah. I tried to walk in…


DRE: [cross] Oh, is that the one everybody’s tweeting about…Klout?


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah, that’s why Klout is going away.


DRE: Okay.


SYLVIA: I’m really—


AUSTIN: I think everyone, if you hear this by the time Klout goes away, should log into Klout once just to get a list of what [DRE: Oh I did.] your expertises are.


SYLVIA: Yeah, I have to wait ‘cause they were like hey, you—deactivated this, so this might take [AUSTIN: Ooh!] two days! [ALI laughs] I’m like damn, okay! I’ll wait for you guys to tell me that I’m an expert in Donkey Kong, ‘cause everyone I know seems to be getting that.


AUSTIN: [amazed] I’m not!


SYLVIA: I’ve seen like four different people be like, I’m in the top 1.9% of people who are experts on Donkey Kong! [AUSTIN: Wow!] And I’m like. [snaps fingers] I know too many [AUSTIN: Nerds.] perverts online.


AUSTIN: Okay, yeah, perverts. That’s fair. Yeah. 


ART: Heh.


AUSTIN: [cross] Lana del Rey is the—


DRE: [cross] I’m a, uh, Michelle Obama expert.


[AUSTIN laughs]


ALI: [doubtful] Mmm…hm!


AUSTIN: [cross] Who is—


DRE: [cross] Uh, also chickens.


AUSTIN: A lot—I saw a lot of chickens out there today!


DRE: Um…Jeff Bezos. I have Jeff Bezos expertise.


AUSTIN: I don’t! Instead, I think my Bezos tweets—sorry, you know what, I didn’t have that many Bezos tweets, and I don’t think I said Bezos in it. I did have some Elon Musk tweets, and so now I’m an occupational safety expert?


DRE: Mm.


ALI: [intrigued] Oh.


ART: Hm!


AUSTIN: Um, also an Ayn Rand expert, apparently. And I really love, I’m a race walking expert.


DRE: Excuse?


AUSTIN: Race walking. I think, and this is what Twitter user vogon suggested, I think he’s right, my last name is Walker. [DRE: Mm.] And I occasionally do tweet about race.


DRE: Yeah, sure.


ALI: [slowly] Oh, wow…


AUSTIN: So I think Klout was like yo, race walking. [amused] Close enough.


[ALI laughs]


SYLVIA: [sighing] Jesus…


ART: You ever wonder why Klout didn’t work?


AUSTIN: Also Pay-per-view expert, which. [laughs] Say again, Art?


ART: You ever wonder why Klout didn’t work?


[SYLVIA snorts]


[AUSTIN laughs]


DRE: Weird. I remember like several years ago when I logged into Klout when it first started and they just like wanted to give me some Gillette razors for free or something like that?

AUSTIN: Mm-hm! That’s exactly why I got it.


DRE: Yeah.


SYLVIA: I still like—I vaguely know what it is for, [amused] but I still don’t really get what the point of it was, y’know? Like what was the goal—I go on there and it’s like, you have ten points! And I was like, what does this mean.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm.


SYLVIA: Can’t be…


DRE: It’s like a weird mix of like LinkedIn, but with like a leaderboard or something.


SYLVIA: Oh, okay!


AUSTIN: The premise is that—so this is like a real thing in a weird way, that—[sighs] Like, it goes like a couple of different ways. It was making transparent a number of things that were previously…things only people in certain hospitality industries took track of? And was trying to like make users attractive to advertisers, [SYLVIA: Mm.] basically? So like for years, you know, hotels would know if you had more twitter followers than [DRE: Mm.] somebody else, or if you had—if you were someone who had a platform of some kind, and would give you special treatment. And like that special treatment wasn’t always just like, here is a free room, or like a comped meal. It was often, hey, we have one upgrade—we need—you know, let’s say you were staying in a room that has two beds in it, but you’re only a single person. We could upgrade you to a better class room because a family needs the two beds. Right?


DRE: Right.


AUSTIN: And who do we give that extra—who do we upgrade? Which single person in a room with two beds gets that upgrade, and the answer is whoever has more twitter followers. Or whoever has a platform. [SYLVIA groans] Because there’s a small chance that they will go out and—or same thing with airlines. Who gets the upgrade to first class because somebody needs to be seated next to somebody else, or whatever, right? And the answer is, whoever can—there’s a chance will make us look good. And Klout was like, oh, we’ll just like make that way clearer, and also, it will be a clearinghouse for brands to send stuff to people who could theoretically then also promote it natively, organically, on their platforms!


ALI: Yeah…


AUSTIN: [cross] But it was just—


ALI: [cross] I remember getting sent uh, gum from Klout. [amused] ‘Cause I had enough [AUSTIN: Same!] followers to get some Juicy Fruit out of it.


AUSTIN: There you go.


[DRE laughs loudly]


How that works out. Currently.


SYLVIA: All right! You know, I was kinda not feelin it, and then you mentioned the Juicy Fruit, and now I’m back on board.


DRE: [cross] Right. 


AUSTIN: [cross] Candy.


ALI: No no, it was like five whole actual packs of gum, like it wasn’t just a sample size, and it was [AUSTIN: Hm? Okay!] good gum! I don’t remember tweeting about it, but…


AUSTIN: I don’t like—I don’t know that I like Juicy Fruit.


ALI: It’s okay once in a while! You know.


AUSTIN: It’s like a sneeze. It’s like what if a gum could just last for as long as a sneeze does.


DRE: Mm.


AUSTIN: [cross] Like all—


SYLVIA: [cross] Poetic.


ART: [cross] I think five packs of Juicy Fruit would last me years.


[ALI laughs]


[AUSTIN laughs]


DRE: Uh, today’s top featured expert for me is Michelle Branch!


AUSTIN: Oh, is she still around? [DRE: Yeah!] What’s she an ex—what’s she an expert in?


DRE: Uh, so I actually saw Michelle Branch in concert last summer. ‘Cause it was like a free [AUSTIN: Aw. Nice!] show. She was actually pretty good! It was a pretty good show! 


AUSTIN: [cross] Good for her.


ART: [cross] She’s got some good songs!


DRE: Yeah!


AUSTIN: I’m not dissing Michelle Branch!


ART: [cross] [amused] Lay off Michelle Branch, Austin!


DRE: [cross] She’s an expert in, uh, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, country music, cooking shows, Grammy awards, Joni Mitchell, Michelle Obama. We have that in common. [AUSTIN: [laughs] Does he?] [someone blows a raspberry] The next time I see a Michelle Branch show, I’ll be like, hey. Klout says that we’re both way into [laughing] Michelle Obama! [laughs quietly]


AUSTIN: She is subtweeting DJ Khaled on twitter, so—or [ART: Perfect.] sub-retweeting. Uh. But still.


SYLVIA: I will be honest, I did have to google who Michelle Branch was.


ALI: [cross] [snorts] Wow…


AUSTIN: [cross] [laughing] Wow…


DRE: So she was not “everywhere to you,” huh?


[ALI yells]


SYLVIA: I’m gonna assume because Wikipedia does say she’s a singer-songwriter…


AUSTIN: Uh-huh!


[30:00]


SYLVIA: Maybe one of the songs she wrote and sang.


ALI: Mm-hm.


ART: Is this something where you’re just too young to know who Michelle Branch—[cross] no, that’s…


ALI: [cross] I think it’s…


AUSTIN: Maybe. Um!


SYLVIA: No, a hundred percent. Probably.


ALI: Yeah. It’s like right in that—‘cause there’s some things where it’s like—some children’s shows. Where if there’s like a [AUSTIN: Yeah.] two or three year gap, there’s gonna be—it’s gonna seem wider than it is.


AUSTIN: [cross] You know, um…


ART: [cross] Michelle Branch was like 2001, and 2002 or something, and that’s…that’s not…


SYLVIA: Yeah, I was very little. Then.


AUSTIN: Were you? I guess so. [SYLVIA: [amused] Yeah!] Yeah.


Um. [cross] Do—but okay—here’s actually—


ART: [cross] Oh my god. I quit this podcast.


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: [confused] What?


SYLVIA: I was seven!


ART: Oh my g—I was in college!


[SYLVIA and ALI laugh hysterically]


DRE: God.


SYLVIA: In 2001—yeah, in 2001 I was seven, yeah. [cross] I’m just making sure I got the math right.


AUSTIN: [cross] But you know—you know…


ART: [cross] Oh, in 2002 I was in college…


DRE: God—[cross] are you that much older than me, Art?


AUSTIN: [cross] I think this is gonna say a lot about the time and like how my brain worked—you know Vanessa Carlton’s…


SYLVIA: Yeah!


AUSTIN: “Miles” or whatever, right?


ALI: Yeah.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Those two songs were basically—they weren’t actually in competition with each other, [SYLVIA: Okay.] but you would have categorized them…


DRE: Yes.


AUSTIN: They would have played in the same slot at your high school dance, or like.


ART: Those songs were both on my first iPod.


AUSTIN: Right.


[ALI snorts]


DRE: [cross] Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: And it’s—


SYLVIA: [cross] I’m sure I’ve heard stuff by her, I just like…


AUSTIN: No.


ALI: What is wrong with you?


SYLVIA: I don’t know, maybe!


AUSTIN: ‘Cause the one you would have heard, you haven’t heart.


SYLVIA: Yeah, true.


DRE: She had another…great song.


SYLVIA: But like I don’t recognize the name but like I might recognize the actual sound of it, you know?


DRE: Oh, she was in that Santana song too.


AUSTIN: [cross] Wait, which one was that?


ALI: [cross] Was she? What?


DRE: Uh, “The Game of Love?” That was like, after they—that was when he did like those like—those big radio singles that he did with like Rob Thomas?


AUSTIN: That was a whole album, yeah.


DRE: Yeah. But she was on one of those.


AUSTIN: Who was—who was the other person in one of those? Who was the other big one?


ALI: Dave Matthews Band?


ART: Rob Thomas?


SYLVIA: Oh, I know this song.


[DRE laughs]


AUSTIN: Well no, what was the other one—


SYLVIA: The “Everywhere” song, sorry. [cross] I was distracted.


AUSTIN: [cross] Oh, “Smooth?” You know “Smooth” by Santana?


SYLVIA: Oh, yeah! I’m a big Rob Thomas-head. Um.


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: That what they call y’all? They call you Thomas-heads?


[ALI yells]


SYLVIA: Yeah. Totally. [someone snorts] I can’t think of anything funnier right now so yep! That’s my answer!


[ALI sighs]


I will say, in the related videos for this the first that isn’t—it’s like, of course, her like latest release, I guess, and right underneath it, Vanessa Carlton “A Thousand Miles.” Which I’m gonna listen to now ‘cause that song is a bop.


AUSTIN: See? See? That song’s a bop!


ART: I have satellite radio.


ALI: Ooh.


ART: And they just released a new station called Pop Rock, which is supposed to be like, rock songs that had pop…runs.


ALI: We know what pop rock is! [laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah. Oh, sorry. 


ART: [cross] I don’t know why I explained it.


AUSTIN: [cross] Ali, Dre and I do. Sylvia was born after pop rock. Ended.


[ALI laughs]


SYLVIA: I was born after—yeah. I’m like…


ALI: Well, Sylvia’s a little more pop punk? [laughs]


AUSTIN: [cross] Right.


SYLVIA: [cross] Oh, def, no.


ART: But they put “A Thousand Miles” on that station, and that’s not a rock song!


DRE: Holy shit!


AUSTIN: [cross] No.


SYLVIA: [cross] Not with that attitude.


ART: They also put [cross] Adele on that station.


DRE: [cross] Did you know…this Santana album has a POD feature!


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: Wyclef Jean. Wyclef Jean was the—Maria Maria was the other one [cross] that like jumped off of that album.


ALI: [cross] Oh! Oh, that was a good one!


DRE: [cross] Oh yeah!


AUSTIN: Yeah, there was a lot of—you know what this is? This album is Carlos Santana throwin fuckin darts at [stammers] a board filled with names of [DRE: Yeah.] other musicians he’s heard of? ‘Cause it is! It’s—it is Dave Matthews, is on this. You’re right. And we already said Rob Thomas, and Wyclef Jean. Also on here: Eagle-Eye Cherry!


ALI: Well.


SYLVIA: Wow.


ALI: That was a t—they had that song at that time.


ART: No, that song [DRE: No.] was like ten years earlier.


DRE: Yeah. [laughs]


ALI: Really?


AUSTIN: Yeah…


ALI: Time.


AUSTIN: Wait, does Eagle-Eye Cherry not have a—why does Eagle-Eye Cherry not click—oh, there it is. I thought maybe Eagle-Eye Cherry didn’t have a Wikipedia page.


[ALI laughs]


DRE: Man.


AUSTIN: Can you imagine?


[ALI laughs quiet]


DRE: “Save Tonight”’s a pretty all right song!


ART: Yeah, but isn’t it like from 1995 or something?


AUSTIN: Look at his face.


DRE: Yeah, for like [AUSTIN: Seven.] 90s [ALI: Mm-hm!] one-hit wonders? “Save Tonight”’s like not a bad song.


AUSTIN: Which one-hit wonder would you wanna be? From the 90s?


DRE: [cross] That’s a fucking deep question.


ART: [cross] Uh, Spin Doctors.


ALI: [cross] Wanna be?


AUSTIN: Spin Doctors have two songs. They got the two—they have—[DRE: Two princes.] maybe I’m wrong. [amused] Maybe I was just thinking of the title “Two Princes.” 


[ALI laughs]


“Little Miss Can’t Be Wrong.” That’s also one.


DRE: Oh, that’s them?


AUSTIN: Yeah.


DRE: Uh.


AUSTIN: Also the one about Superman. [cross] Which I think follows Two Princes.


ART: [cross] No—I bet none of those charted like “Two Princes.” 


No. The Superman song is Five for Flight?


AUSTIN: No. No, yeah, that’s a different Superman song. There [Oh, okay.] were a number of competing [cross] Superman songs from 90s.


SYLVIA: [cross] There’s a lot of Superman songs.


ALI: Mm. Yeah. Big Superman run.


AUSTIN: Um. The one—it’s the one [DRE laughs] It’s great!] where they’re like, it’s me, I’m Jimmy Olsen.


DRE: Oh!


ART: Yeah, the Spin Doctors have “Pocket Full of Kryptonite.”


AUSTIN: That’s not them. [slight laugh]


ALI: W…


AUSTIN: [amused] That’s another, third song.


ART: [completely disbelieving] What?


AUSTIN: Spin Doctors have “Jimmy Olsen Blues.”


ART: No. Shut up!


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah!


ART: No, they have an album called “Pocket Full of Kryptonite.”


AUSTIN: Who?


ART: The Spin Doctors!


DRE: [cross] I’m looking this up.


AUSTIN: [cross] Who?


[ALI laughs]


ART: That’s the album “The Two Princes” is off of!


DRE: Yes. He’s right. [cross] Art is correct.


AUSTIN: [cross] But is that off of the album that “Jimmy Olsen Blues” is on?


DRE: Yes. [SYLVIA: Yes it is.] It’s the first track.


AUSTIN: Okay. Oh—


DRE: And “Little Miss Can’t Be Wrong.”


AUSTIN: [amused] The song in which they say ‘I got a pocket full of Kryptonite’ is “Jimmy Olsen Blues.”


ALI: Mm.


ART: [disbelieving] What?


AUSTIN: Yeah. That song is called “Jimmy Olsen’s Blues,” not “Pocket Full of Kryptonite.”


ART: That’s…this is…


AUSTIN: Is that a song about murdering Superman?


ART: Kinda.


AUSTIN: Is that song really shitty? Is that like—is this like a…um. [cross] A Roxanne situation, or a…?


ART: [cross] I know the lyric is I got something for—‘I got a little something for Miss Lois Lane.’


AUSTIN: Jesus!


ART: Okay [SYLVIA: Heavy!] and—and “Two Princes” charted at number 7. “Jimmy Olsen’s Blues” at 78, and—I guess “Little Miss Can’t Be Wrong” was top 20. Okay.


AUSTIN: See?

ART: I’ll give it to em. Oh, they had like a charting hit in 1994 with “You Let Your Heart Go Too Fast,” which I never heard of, but.


DRE: Mm.


ART: Was a Top Ten rock hit.


DRE: [cross] Oh man.


AUSTIN: [cross] [groans] It’s not one of their top Genius.com songs.


DRE: Phew. This Billboard like ‘Top 20 Songs of the 90s’ playlist is a lot.


AUSTIN: Best one-hit wonders of the 90s. Here we go.


ART: They covered “That’s the Way I Like It?”


AUSTIN: [shocked] The Spin Doctors?


[ALI makes a judgemental noise]


ART: Yeah. For the Space Jam soundtrack.


ALI: Oh!


AUSTIN: Oh my god.


ART: The Biz Markie.


DRE: Can I pick “Nothing Compares 2 U” but it’s always the Prince live version?


[AUSTIN makes a doubtful noise]


ALI: [doubtful noise] No. [AUSTIN: No.] That just came out! [slight laugh] It was like a new release.


DRE: [cross] He was like playing that though.


ART: [cross] No, that’s the studio version. There’s the Prince live version.


ALI: No—yeah. Fair.


AUSTIN: What about…god this list of top 25 one-hit wonders from the 90s. [sighs] I like that this list—this is from John Barrett over at paste magazine…


DRE: God, Smooth was that old? Smooth was ‘99.


AUSTIN: Yeah, Smooth’s old. Smooth’s old. Smooth’s before 2000. Yeah.


DRE: That was the same year as No Scrubs!


AUSTIN: Sylvia wasn’t even born yet.


ALI: [cross] Oh, I’m White Town’s “Your Woman?”


SYLVIA: [cross] Yeah, no, I was…


ALI: Sorry! I was looking at a li—[laughs]


AUSTIN: Excuse me?


ART: Oh, uh, is the Breakfast at Tiffany’s band a one-hit wonder?


ALI: [cross] Yeah.


AUSTIN: [cross] Yes.


DRE: Yes. A hundred percent.


AUSTIN: Hundred percent.


ART: [cross] That’s the best song ever recorded.


SYLVIA: [cross] The fact that you cannot name the band! [ALI laughs] Is a sign towards that!


AUSTIN: Can we guess at what the band is named, ‘cause I know it. I have it in front of me.


SYLVIA: I have no idea.


ART: Oh, it’s like—it’s like—


DRE: The Breakfast at Tiffany’s?


ART: It’s like…it’s…


DRE: Is it like Blue something?


ART: It’s like, Deep Blue Nowhere.


[someone snorts]


AUSTIN: What would it be—it’s Deep Blue—what were you saying, Dre?


DRE: I just said Blue something. I just remember they have blue in their name.


AUSTIN: Okay. Does anyone know what that third word could be? ‘Cause it is definitely…it’s definitely Deep Blue something.


ART: Deep Blue Computer. Deep Blue…


AUSTIN: Not computer.


DRE: Wait, is it actually Something?


AUSTIN: [amused] It’s actually Something. [DRE: God damn it.] It’s actually “Deep Blue Something.”


[DRE laughs]


ART: [cross] That’s a good song.


AUSTIN: [cross] How’s that song go? Eh. I remember liking it.


[DRE starts singing the tune]


Oh, ‘we’ll always have’—yeah yeah yeah, okay. Yeah yeah yeah. Okay. Right.


[singing] ‘One thing we got—’ right. Yeah. Uh-huh.


[ALI laughs]


[someone hums more of the song]


Uh. That’s number 23 on this list—25! Natalie Imbruglia’s “Torn.”


ALI: Oh.


AUSTIN: Which came out the year I went to Australia, and so I loved it.


[ALI laughs]


DRE: Oh, yeah.


AUSTIN: It took me a long time to then realize what that song was about, and be like, Hm! Okay!


DRE: [cross] You were being a cultural ambassador.


ART: [cross] Well, and it’s a cover! That’s the…


AUSTIN: Right.


ART: That’s the real thing. That’s the…


AUSTIN: Is it?


ART: [cross] It’s a cover!

DRE: [cross] Yeah.


AUSTIN: Huh! Okay. Uh, 24: Eagle-Eye Cherry, “Save Tonight.” 23: Deep Blue Something’s “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” The Verve Pipe’s freshmen—“The Freshmen.” [cross] Remember that song? Remember that classic?


DRE: [cross] Aw. Yeah.


ALI: [cross] That’s a good one. It’s weird ‘cause The Verve Pipe is a one-hit wonder, and so is The Verve.


AUSTIN: They’re also on this list!

[ALI laughs]


Um. [cross] Baz Luhrmann’s Ev—


ART: [cross] They wrote [inaudible]?


AUSTIN: I don’t think so, no. Baz Luhrmann’s “Everybody’s Free to Wear Sunscreen,” [cross] which I don’t know…


ALI: [cross] Yeah.


DRE: [cross] Oh, I remember that.


AUSTIN: How’s that go?


ART: [cross] It’s this spoken word thing.


DRE: [cross] They played that at like—it was like a…a spoken word thing that they played at like graduations and stuff ‘cause it was basically like [ALI: Yeah.] a person being like, [lecturing tone] here’s some life advice for you.


AUSTIN: Oh!


DRE: Like it was spoken word like over [cross] like just like a very like ambient beat track.


ALI: [cross] Yeah. And then it was like [singing] doot doot doot doot doot doot, doot doot…


AUSTIN: I have a question. Is this vaporwave?


ALI: Yeah, probably.


ART: Maybe, yeah.


AUSTIN: Have you seen the video for this?


ART: No.


SYLVIA: I’m gonna watch it.


ALI: Not in years.


AUSTIN: It’s like 90s vaporwave, basically.


ALI: I was a big MTV kid, so I’ve probably seen it, but…


ART: I don’t know if counts as a one-hit wonder if the guy who did it then decided to like movies, I don’t know if like…


[ALI exhales loudly in surprise]


AUSTIN: He must have already been doing that, right? [cross] ‘Cause like—he did—


ART: [cross] Yeah, I think that song appears in Romeo + Juliet.


AUSTIN: It must!


DRE: [cross] Oh god, that’s what…


ALI: [cross] That was his big break!


AUSTIN: Can we do a season—can we do a season of Romeo + Juliet?


ART: [cross] Yes we can!


ALI: [cross] Puh-lease! [sighs]


[DRE sighs]


AUSTIN: Like are you f—I guess that’s a Bluff City game, right?


DRE: I need to rewatch that. I remember not liking it when I watched it.


[ALI gasps in horror]


AUSTIN: You should rewatch it.


ALI: I—yeah. I think—yeah.


DRE: I think—


AUSTIN: [amused] Or get off this podcast!


DRE: [over ART laughing]—when I watched it, I was like in like peak like shitty English major like, [AUSTIN: Mm-hm.] uuuugh! mood. So like.


ALI: Yeah…


AUSTIN: Have you looked at the fashion in that fuckin movie?


DRE: I’m sure it’s out.


AUSTIN: It’s unbelievably good.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


DRE: ‘Cause see, like, when I watched it I would—I am not the kind of person who would—I was not the kind of person who would appreciate a gun just having ‘sword’—


[ALI starts laughing]


AUSTIN: Okay, well. Now…


ART: [cross] Broadsword, broadsword.


AUSTIN: [cross] Now you are, so…dagger? god!


DRE:—[cross] written on the side, and now I am a hundred percent the kind of person who would have a gun written sword on the side of it.


AUSTIN: God!


ALI: [cross] It’s so good…


SYLVIA: [cross] That movie’s like stupid as hell but in the best way.


ALI: Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: [cross] Oh, a hundred percent!


SYLVIA: [cross] Like I love—it’s Baz Luhrmann at his like most…without being like insufferable.


AUSTIN: Right! Like. Do the fuckin thing. Like go there. Yeah. Um. It’s so goofy. I love it. Aw, fuck, I remembered about how good Tybalt is? God damn!


ART: And Mercutio is pretty awesome, right?


AUSTIN: Mercutio and—yeah, Mercutio and Tybalt both like completely steal the show.


ART: Well, ‘cause Tybalt is John Leguizamo, right?


AUSTIN: Yeah yeah yeah yeah. A hundred percent.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Uh, can I copy this whole image? Is that a thing I can do? Let me see. Can just copy a link. I’ll just copy a link.


DRE: Oh, man.


AUSTIN: I got a whole fuckin gallery of good gifs here.


DRE: You guys remember “Bailamos?” [cross] That Enrique song? Man.


ALI: [cross] Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Yeah, ‘let the rhythm take you over.’


AUSTIN: Mm…Is that 90s?


DRE: [cross] It’s 1999. He snuck it right in there.


ALI: [cross] Yeah. Oh wow. [laughs]


AUSTIN: He knew.


DRE: Heartbreaker was 1999.


AUSTIN: [intense] Oh my god, this fuckin camera motion is the best thing I’ve seen in my life! Are you kidding me! Look at this reveal! Of his fucking costume! It’s so good!


[ALI starts laughing]


ART: What are we looking at?


AUSTIN: In the Bluff City chat.


SYLVIA: I fuckin love John Leguizamo in that movie.


AUSTIN: Me too!


SYLVIA: I fuckin love John Leguizamo in general! I don’t know what he’s like as a person, but I love him in everything I see him in. Even if he’s terrible.


ALI: I was—I was like a foot away from him, really.


DRE: [cross] Yeah, I kind of…


SYLVIA: [cross] Oh my god.


AUSTIN: When?


ALI: He was at Moco, which is like a comcis festival, all the way, fucking, in the depths of Midtown.


AUSTIN: What was he doing?


ALI: He was there signing a comic that was about his life.


AUSTIN: Oh!


ALI: Yeah.


ART: Oh, he’s wearing sequin devil ears!


ALI: [cross] Yeah! That’s the kush!


AUSTIN: [cross] That’s what I’m saying! That’s the reveal on that gif! It’s incredible! It’s John Leguizamo taking a drag out of a cigarette, and then it zooms out to reveal he has sequined devil ears and a devil like shirt underneath, all red sequins, and then that he is also flanked on each side by like skeletons [DRE: Skeletons.] wearing hats. Yeah.


DRE: [cross] Who does he play?


ART: [cross] [shocked] Oh my god!


DRE: You said he was Tybalt?


AUSTIN: He’s Tybalt. [cross] Yeah, he’s like—yeah. Yeah! Uh-huh!


DRE: [cross] Okay. Yeah. No, this tracks. This tracks.


ART: Yeah, we should do this. Can we—


AUSTIN: It’s good.


ART: Can we do th--what…


AUSTIN: What time is it?


[ALI and SYLVIA laugh]


DRE: Yeah, let’s do this now. Fuck it.


AUSTIN: Um, OMC’s “How Bizarre” comes in at number 20. You remember that’s the one that goes [vaguely New Zealand accent] ‘How bizarre!’ That one.


DRE: How bizarre! [hums tune]


AUSTIN: Uh-huh. This one’s a cheat. This is a cheat. 19, The Rembrandt’s “I’ll Be There For You.” 


SYLVIA: [cross] Yeah.


ALI: [cross] Oh no.


AUSTIN: [cross] Which I loved! Even though I hated Friends!


ALI: Oh, really?


DRE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: I’m not a Friends person.


ART: [cross] Oh, that’s a good song.


ALI: [cross] That’s a good thing. No, I’m not surprised you hate Friends. I’m surprised that you were like oh, I love the Friends song. [cross] Don’t wanna watch the show!


AUSTIN: [cross] Oh, I loved that song. And it’s like, I gotta turn on VH1 and watch “I’ll Be There For You” by The Rembrandts.


ALI: Awww! [laughs slightly]


AUSTIN: Hey mom, did you know the people who do the Friends song are called The Rembrandts and it’s called “I’ll Be There For You.” ‘Cause they’re friends.


DRE: No wonder we clap so much on this show.


[AUSTIN and ALI laugh]


AUSTIN: [clapping] That’s why they’re called clapcasts!


DRE: Yep.


ALI: Oh, boy…


AUSTIN: Uh, Lou Bega’s Mambo Number 5.


ALI: Classic.


AUSTIN: Also just snuck right in there at 1999. Len’s “Steal My Sunshine”—also ‘99! I thought that was way earlier!


SYLVIA: That song fuckin rules though!


ALI: [cross] Yeah. Mm-hm.


DRE: [cross] Yeah.


AUSTIN: [cross] That song rules. That song absolutely rules.


SYLVIA: Have y’all heard the…on the AV Club Undercover, Charlie Bliss—a band that I really like—did a cover of it, and it’s super fucking good.


ALI: Ooh!


SYLVIA: [cross] I’ll link it.


AUSTIN: [cross] I would listen to that. Uh, The Toadies’ song, [laughing] “Possum Kingdom.”


ALI: Oh, I love that song.


DRE: Oh. Yeah.


AUSTIN: Wait, how’s that go? [cross] I don’t remember this—


ALI: [cross] I was five and so into this [laughs] song! Because I listened to it later.


AUSTIN: What is it? How’s this go?


ALI: It’s like kind of a gritty rock song? [cross] It’s like shoegaze before there was shoegaze?


DRE: [cross] All I remember is…


AUSTIN: [cross] Oh, this song!


ALI: Yeah.


DRE: All I remember is like the bridge where he’s like [singing] ‘Do you wanna die?!’


ALI: Yeah! [laughing]


AUSTIN: Dre, are you in The Toadies?


[ALI shrieks and laughs harder]


DRE: [amused] I don’t like to talk about it a lot. [cross] It’s a past life that I’ve left behind.


AUSTIN: [cross] Oh, I love the bridge!


ALI: It’s so—it’s such a good song.


AUSTIN: The bridge of this song definitely…totally shaped my aesthetic taste.


ALI: Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: Where he’s like…like, [half-singing] give it up to me—and like the guitar is building slowly? Ah, it’s very good.


ALI: Yeah. Mm-hm!


AUSTIN: It’s very good.


ALI: Mm-hm!


AUSTIN: [cross] All right. Uh.


ALI: [cross] Music influences.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh. 15: Marcy Playground, “Sex and Candy.” Very much I was twelve years old, which meant that that was a song where they said sex, and I went.


DRE: Uh-huh. 


AUSTIN: ‘That’s a song where they say sex.’


[DRE and ALI laugh]


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Which is weird, because by then I was listening to rap music pretty regularly, where they talked about sex a lot more, but they didn’t name songs “Sex and Candy.”


ALI: Yeah. That’s true!


AUSTIN: [laughing slightly] White Town.


ALI: That’s me! That’s the one me.


[AUSTIN laughs silently]


This is the one that’s me.


AUSTIN: Ex—


ALI: [cross] Remember at the beginning of this conversation when you were like—


DRE: [cross] You? You’re White Town?


AUSTIN: You’re White Town?


[SYLVIA starts laughing]


ALI: [laughing] I’m “Your Woman!” By White Town—this song is so good! Fuck off!


AUSTIN: You know your name is White Town, right?


[ALI laughs]


[DRE laughs]


You said “I’m White Town.”


[laughs trail off]


ALI: Excuse me, at the beginning of the conversation yeah, you were like which 90s one-hit [AUSTIN: Got you.] wonder song you’d be. This one’s me.


AUSTIN: I forgot that that was the whole premise of this.


ALI: I—yeah, and laying claim.


SYLVIA: [struggling not to laugh] I pulled it up on YouTube and the annotation on the beginning said, ‘Star Wars? Am I gay? [cross] What the fuck is this song about?’


DRE: [cross] [laughing] Why do you—


AUSTIN: [cross] It is Ali!


ALI: [cross] Fuckin, I told you!


DRE: Is it? Wait.


ALI: [laughing] I told you!


AUSTIN: [cross] What is it?


DRE: [cross] It’s either Ali or it’s like Macklemore’s like pre-band he did.


[AUSTIN and ALI laugh]


When he was cleaning his room still.


AUSTIN: [laughing] He was like, wait a second, I like Star Wars. Does that mean I’m gay?


ALI: Cleaning up his room still is really [laughing] funny…


[SYLVIA laughs]


AUSTIN: He was very messy.


[ALI laughs]


[SYLVIA sighs]


ART: That’s a messy fuckin room.


[Everyone laughs again]


AUSTIN: God.


ALI: Anyway, this song bangs.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh, number 13: House of Pain’s “Jump Around.”


DRE: Oh yeah, sure.


AUSTIN: Ever lasts.


ALI: Oh this is a classic. We --okay.


AUSTIN: It’s a classic.


ALI: When I—when my family had a rabbit, my mom would play this song!


AUSTIN: Aw!


DRE: Aw!


[ALI laughs]


SYLVIA: That’s really cute.


ALI: It was really good. It was very good.


AUSTIN: That’s very good. I had a friend who was convinced that…[sighs] someone legit was in House of Pain. Someone I know was like convinced—Art, it was Frank—was convinced that House of Pain included someone like DMX in it?


ART: [baffled] What?


AUSTIN: [amused] Yeah, a hundred percent. And I was like—


ART: [cross] Well, if people are gonna think…


AUSTIN: [cross] [laughing] I don’t think that’s true, Frank! Anyway, “Jump Around”’s an all right track.


SYLVIA: Eh!

ART: And DMX is not on it.


AUSTIN: No.


DRE: God, can you imagine, though?


AUSTIN: Ah—I bet I could find you the remix!


[DRE laughs]


[funny voice] Mm, DMX, “Jump Around.”


ART: Well, Lil Wayne is on “Back That Ass Up.”


AUSTIN: Correct. Correct. Um.


Oh my god. Mack Miller doing a House of Pain cover is the last thing I would ever want to see.


Uh, [DRE: Aw damn.] Spacehog’s “In the Meantime.” Also on this list.


DRE: What?


SYLVIA: [sighing] God!


AUSTIN: Spacehog. “In the Meantime.”


DRE: I don’t—that…


ALI: [cross] Mm?


AUSTIN: [cross] Spacehog!


DRE: I gotta look that up.


AUSTIN: [cross] I’m gonna—


ART: [cross] Yeah, I don’t know that one either.


ALI: I have no idea what that is.


AUSTIN: You would know it immediately. Wait. Maybe I don’t. Oh yeah, this song!


DRE: Oh yeah!


SYLVIA: Yeah.


DRE: I don’t know any of the words, but [AUSTIN: Me either!] I recognize the weird like phone modem noise at the beginning.


AUSTIN: I remember that going [singing] oo-oo-oo-oo [SYLVIA: Yeah.] oo-oo-oo-oo. Or whatever.


SYLVIA: [cross] I remember his weird howl.


ART: [cross] Is this band Space Dick?


SYLVIA: [sighs] They did name their band Space Dick!


AUSTIN: Uh, New Radicals. “You Get What You Give.”


DRE: Uh-huh.


AUSTIN: I like need to look up all of these. [cross] This is the worst.


DRE: [cross] Don’t give up! You got the music in you.


ALI: [cross] My mom still…listens to this song once a week, too.


AUSTIN: Oh! That’s this song.


ALI: Yes. Good one.


AUSTIN: Wow, I didn’t know this was so early!


ALI: [cross] Good for washing the dishes.


AUSTIN: [cross] 98? How did the 2000s happen after this song came out?


ALI: [laughs] I wanna do this again with 2000s songs and just be like, that was in the 2000s?


AUSTIN: Ben Folds Five’s “Brick.” What a—wait. 


ALI: Ben—


AUSTIN: Ben Folds—


ALI: [doubtful] Mm.


AUSTIN: What?!


DRE: [over everyone going Mm doubtfully] That’s not a one-hit wonder!


ALI: [cross] I think—


AUSTIN: [cross] When was this?


DRE: It was before [cross] “Rock the Suburbs” came out.


SYLVIA: [cross] Right — 


AUSTIN: Oh oh oh oh oh, wait, wait, wait wait wait. This was published September 28th 2011. So.


[ALI laughs]


There—it is before Ben Folds’ resurgence in the last like—like immediately after this was published, right?


ALI: The resurgence is like Ben Folds as a singles artist though, right? So the band was a one-hit wonder.


AUSTIN: Oh! [cross] Maybe you’re right.


DRE: [cross] When did—when did—Rockin’ the Suburbs came out like 2001.


ALI: Oh…


DRE: Although was that Ben Folds Five [cross] or was that just Ben Folds?


ALI: [cross] I think that was just Ben Folds.


SYLVIA: That was—


AUSTIN: [cross] That’s just Ben Folds.


SYLVIA: [cross] That was just Folds. Yeah.


DRE: Okay.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


DRE: They still reference that on SportsCenter, so it counts.


ALI: [amused] Oh, okay.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.


ALI: Okay!


AUSTIN: What do they say, like, he hit it so hard, that one’s gonna be rockin’ the suburbs!


DRE: No, they’re like, uh, they’re like—whenever somebody goes and plays, like, bomp! Rockin’ the Suburbs! Just like blah blah blah did! 


[AUSTIN laughs quietly] 


It’s very bad. It’s not a good [ALI: Wow…] reference or joke.


SYLVIA: That’s worse than fuckin WWE commentary.


[AUSTIN laughs]


DRE: Yeah man.


SYLVIA: Jesus!


DRE: There are certain SportsCenter anchors that need to go.


AUSTIN: [sighs] They’re rockin the suburbs, just like Fandango!


SYLVIA: Augh!


[ALI laughs]


Back to the one-hit wonders, please!


[AUSTIN and ALI laugh]


SYLVIA: [cross] Oh my god, I can’t!

AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah! Fandango! I said that’s it!


SYLVIA: Augh!


[DRE sighs]


AUSTIN: Um, The Breeders’ Cannonball might be [SYLVIA: Ah.] my. claim?


SYLVIA: That’s a good one…


AUSTIN: That song is dope. The Breeders are incredible. Everyone should go listen to The Breeders. Um. I’m still in love with Kim Deal. Uh, Stereo MC’s “Connected.” Ring any bells?


SYLVIA: No!


DRE: [negative] Mm-mm.


ALI: Oh, I should listen to more of The Breeders, holy shit!


AUSTIN: Yo, [slight laugh] The Breeders are fuckin incredible!


SYLVIA: The Breeders fuckin rule!


AUSTIN: They’re like legitimately fuckin fantastic.


DRE: I’ve never heard this song, but yeah.


AUSTIN: Oh! Yes you have. You’ve definitely heard the [ALI: Yeah.] Stereo MC song in like, um.


DRE: Oh, I meant this Breeders song.


AUSTIN: Wait, you’ve never heard—[cross] you’ve [DRE: No!] never heard “Cannonball?”


ART: [cross] You’ve never heard “Cannonball?”


SYLVIA: Oh my god.


DRE: I mean, [AUSTIN: Oh my god!] maybe I have, but I don’t remember it. But yeah, [cross] now I’m feeling very…left out.


AUSTIN: [cross] You—you’re—yeah, they’re great. Kim Deal was the bassist from The Pixies. [DRE and ALI: Ohhh!] When The Pixies break up, she and her twin sister start The Breeders. It’s brutal, because they also both have really rough drug addictions.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: They’re both doing well now, is my understanding, which is great. I mean, you know, Kim came back for The Pixies reunion in the late 2000s.


SYLVIA: Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: So, and I think that they’ve been touring and making new music! But some of their music is just incredible. Um! Anyway, the Stereo MC song I feel like is in every Guy Ritchie—trailer, or something, you know?


DRE: Which song is it?


AUSTIN: “Connected?”


ALI: I feel like I’ve never heard that.


DRE: Let me see if I recognize this…


AUSTIN: Jump to like 1…:25. I can just paste it. [DRE: Oh, yeah.] Just imagine like some British crime people being like…[vaguely English accent] ‘Right.’ 


DRE: Yes. Absolutely.


AUSTIN: ‘Break down the door and take the money.’ Or whatever British crime people do.


DRE: Yes.


AUSTIN: Uh…7. Primitive Radio Gods: “Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand.”


ALI: What…!


SYLVIA: What?


AUSTIN: Okay, it was apparently in The Cable Guy. [cross] I don’t know this!


DRE: [cross] Like Larry the Cable Guy?


AUSTIN: No! What?


DRE: I—yeah, no, I know. The Jim Carrey movie, right?


AUSTIN: Oh. The Jim Carrey movie.


Oh boy, you know this is a great song because I clicked—I searched for it and the number one hit is a fuckin Vimeo link.


ALI: Wow…


AUSTIN: Oh—[cross] this is—this is—


ALI: [cross] I do know this song though.


AUSTIN: So many of these are like people who make rot mu—rot. People who make rock music learn what a sample is?


[ALI laughs]


And like do some like corny…


DRE: Mm.


AUSTIN: Like, archival…sample in their hook?


ALI: Yeah…


AUSTIN: This is the [singing] doot doot doot-doot doot-doot-doot-doot.


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Doot doot doot-doot doot-doot-doot-doot.


ALI: I—because we do One Song Only I keep thinking about how like growing up in California and listening to this a bunch, and then moving to New York and getting really into Kanye West makes sense in my life?


AUSTIN: Uh-huh! Oh yeah.


ALI: [laughs] This is one of those like, [SYLVIA chuckles] oh, it’s a puzzle piece. Okay, there we go.


AUSTIN: I’ll be honest, like I definitely grew up hearing all of these. Like [ALI: Yeah.] my mom is very much the person who is in this—this was her exact demographic.


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: W—she was like—she liked music younger than she was. Y’know? Um. Haddaway’s “What is Love” coming in at number 6. Which feels again like a cheat, because it’s tied to a thing, like the thing that blew that song up was Saturday Night Live.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


DRE: Yeah.


ALI: Yeah…but I think it probably—people also actually liked it.


ART: Well, and then again, when [pronounced yit - mend] YTMND did it, right?


AUSTIN: …Who?


ALI: Hm?


ART: Y-T-M-N-D?


AUSTIN: Oh. Yes.


ALI: [laughing] Oh!


DRE: [yit-mend] YTMND.


AUSTIN: I’ve never heard that called [yit-mend] YTMND.


DRE: No, me neither.


SYLVIA: Never in my life!


ART: Well, you should have talked to Andrew S[redacting beep] more.


AUSTIN: [laughs hard] [cross] How’s he doin?


DRE: [cross] Maybe not, if you all were talking about [read as letters] YTMND! [laughs]


AUSTIN: God. Um, “Closing Time.” By Semisonic.


ALI: Wait.


DRE: Aw yeah.


AUSTIN: …Who I would never [SYLVIA: Yeah.] have named that band, but I think we all know “Closing Time.”


ALI: Yeah.


DRE: God, I…


AUSTIN: [cross] So, you’re—


DRE: [cross] …talked about “Closing Time” last night with somebody.


AUSTIN: Right.


SYLVIA: I unironically adore that song. [cross] It’s really catchy.


AUSTIN: [cross] It’s a good song!


DRE: [cross] No, it’s good.


ALI: It’s so good.


AUSTIN: [cross] It’s super interesting to think—


ART: [cross] The really annoying thing about that song is that the guy who wrote it insists that it’s about giving birth.


ALI: [sucks teeth] Shut up.


SYLVIA: What?! No!


[DRE laughs loudly]


AUSTIN: “Closing Time?”


ART: I’ve seen like an interview where he’s like, see, it’s like this little place won’t be open til your brothers and your sisters come. It’s like shut up, you made a song about a bar. You have to fucking live with it for the rest of your life. Shut up.


AUSTIN: We’re talking about “Closing Time,” ‘one last call for alcohol, so finish your whiskey or beer’?


ALI: Yeah.


DRE: [wisely] Yeah, because see, when you get pregnant, you can’t drink anymore, Austin.


ALI: Oh. Shut the fuck up!


[DRE laughs]


SYLVIA: Yeah.


[DRE trail off laughing]


AUSTIN: We’re talking about “Closing Time,” ‘so gather up your jackets, move it to the exits’?


SYLVIA: Mm-hm.


ART: [cross] Yeah, the exits.


DRE: [cross] See, ‘cause you’re—


ART: Get out.


DRE: You’re—well, also, because like, you know, [ALI sighs] when you’re pregnant, you gotta get like new clothes and stuff, so you’ve gotta gather up your jackets and move them to the exit and then get some new jackets.


AUSTIN: Did you—are you [DRE: Or something.] the person who annotated this on Genius?


DRE: Yeah, did you not…?


[SYLVIA laughs]


It’s part of my Klout score.


SYLVIA: [loud laugh] Expert on [cross] Semisonic’s shitty lyrics.


AUSTIN: [cross] Expert on—yeah!


SYLVIA: [laughs] Not even shitty lyrics, shitty meaning behind your…


AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah. That’s…


SYLVIA: [cross] Four like normal lyrics, is the thing.


ART: Just like lying to sound interesting…about your song later.


SYLVIA: Ah…


DRE: Oh…


AUSTIN: Right.


DRE: You mean everyone who’s in the second year of their English degree program?


[AUSTIN laughs]


I say this as something with an English degree!


AUSTIN: Uh-huh! Yep. I as a kid loved songs like that and “The Freshman” and “Brick” because they were sad…


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: …And they meant something. And that’s how I got to be me. So.


[DRE laughs]


ALI: Yeah. [quietly] Yeah!


AUSTIN: Chumbawamba. “Tubthumping.”


AUSTIN: [cross] Number four.


ALI: [cross] Great.


DRE: [cross] Augh.


ALI: Great one.


ART: A fantastic song. 


ALI: Great one…


ART: I say without a trace of irony.


SYLVIA: Yeah! No, that’s fun.


AUSTIN: “No Rain,” number three by Blind Melon.


DRE: [cross] Oh, another great song.


ALI: [cross] [amused] I could talk about the—okay. That song is great.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh?


ALI: Fucking, okay. So there was like a p—there’s like a pop cover of this that came out recently?


AUSTIN: [intrigued] Mm!


ALI: Um. That they would play on the Best Buy radio station and I would have to listen to four times a day. Other fact about Blind Melon: when I was in—or this song specifically—when I was in middle school, in my health class, they handed out the lyrics to it and was like ‘this person killed themselves. Identify the reasons why in these lyrics.’


DRE: Woah!


AUSTIN: Woah! That is not a good—no! That is not a good…


ALI: Nope! Wasn’t great! Wasn’t a great lesson. But. [laughs] You know. If that’s how you wanna teach that. All of that evidence is there. So, really great to listen to in Best Buy.


AUSTIN: I have two things to say.


ALI: [amused] Please.


AUSTIN: One. I…I know the song “No Rain,” I could tell you—I could describe for you the video.


ALI: Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: I know how the dude from Blind Melon sounds when he sings. Earlier tonight. Twelve minutes ago, thirteen minutes ago? I don’t know how many! While I was listening to Len’s “Steal My Sunshine” I thought to myself, oh, that’s the one with the little girl in the bee costume.


[ALI laughs]


[SYLVIA laughs]


Which is fact the video to “No Rain,” by Blind Melon. That’s the first thing. The second thing is, about six weeks ago, Vinnie Caravella and I were at a bar, and a band came in and set up shop.


ALI: Oh, right. [laughs quietly]


AUSTIN: And they said like, hello, Cleveland! And it was like, okay, we’re not—we’re like—we’re in New York. City.


[SYLVIA laughs quietly]


And. They then said like we’re gonna kick things off with one off with one of our favorite songs. Our favorite Blind Melon song. And then, instead of playing “No Rain,” they started playing “November Rain.” And they just straightfaced—just—no jokiness.


SYLVIA: God…


AUSTIN: And the rest of—that was it—and we left. And so, I don’t know if they were confused, [ALI laughs] or if they were just being trolls. [snorts] Probably the latter. Number two, on this list: Harvey Danger’s “Flagpole Sitta.”


DRE: [cross] Oh, shit.


SYLVIA: [cross] I fuckin—I love that song.


ALI: [cross] That song is so good.


SYLVIA: That song fuckin rules so much. [cross] That’s my pick off the list, honestly.


ALI: [cross] It’s so good.


AUSTIN: [cross] Yep.


ART: But you don’t know what number one is. I have like a really solid idea of what number one is gonna be, and I’m so psyched for it.


ALI: There’s a specific lyric in this song…


AUSTIN: We should all type in what we think our number one is [cross] gonna be—what the number one is gonna be.


ALI: [cross] I have it open. So I know it.


SYLVIA: [cross] I already saw it.


DRE: Oh, I haven’t seen it.


AUSTIN: Oh. Well. Well Dre, [SYLVIA: I’m sorry.] do you wanna take a guess, and Art, do you wanna take a guess?


DRE: Is it a one-hit wonder? It’s a one-hit wonder?


AUSTIN: It’s a one-hit wonder.


DRE: All right, where are we typing our guesses in?


AUSTIN: In Bluff.


[sound of typing]


DRE: Okay.


ALI: Wow…


AUSTIN: [chuckles] You both got just fuckin…


ALI: Wow…


AUSTIN: …owned. Um. It’s a shame, ‘cause both of your guesses are so much better.


ALI: [noncommittally] Mm…


DRE: Mine’s not better. Art’s is better, [cross] ‘cause that song is incredible.


AUSTIN: [cross] No, but. For songs that should have made this cut. Actually, wait.


DRE: Oh, hold on. Hold on, I’ve got one more. [typing]


AUSTIN: [cross] That’s a great one too, honestly.


ALI: [cross] Oh, that’s—80s? No, isn’t that 80s?


DRE: Was it 80s?


SYLVIA: Ice Ice Baby came out in ‘89.


AUSTIN: Did it, or was that 90?


SYLVIA: No, ‘89. I looked it up just now.


ALI: I think “Return of the Mack”…


DRE: [cross] Yeah, “Return of the Mack” was like 96…


AUSTIN: [cross] “Return of the Mack” was like 96…yeah.


DRE: The fact that that’s not on this whole list…


SYLVIA: “Return of the Mac.” Yeah.


DRE: …is fucking garbage.


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Um, Art’s guess, “No Diggity.” Very good guess. Very good song. Not the number one on this list.


ART: Are they like counting it as a Dr. Dre song or something?


AUSTIN: No—[slight laugh] no, I don’t think so. Um. The number one song is The Verve’s “Bittersweet Symphony.”


DRE: Ohhh! I mean, you’ve gotta have that on the list, but I don’t think that’s number one.


ALI: That’s a big one!


AUSTIN: It’s a big one.


DRE: [cross] It is big! I don’t know.


ART: [cross] It’s such a long song.


[ALI laughs slightly]


DRE: It is.


ALI: Love long songs.


AUSTIN: [nerd voice] Uhh, I’m Art. I hate long songs. Listen to One Song Pod.


ALI: [laughs] Anyway, the…


AUSTIN: That’s not the name of the podcast, is it? It’s One Song Only.


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: This is why we didn’t record an episode tonight, ‘cause I couldn’t even remember the name of one of my podcasts.


ART: Is it Waypoint Phonograph?


AUSTIN: Sw—it’s somethin like that. [chuckles]


ALI: Boy.


ART: That’s like the worst joke ever. I’m so sorry about that.


[AUSTIN snorts]


[SYLVIA laughs]


ALI: [quietly] You know? It’s not bad. [sighs]


AUSTIN: All right. [cross] Are we good?


ALI: [cross] Anyone good? [laughs]


ART: Yeah, I think let’s clap and get out of here.


ALI: [cross] We’ve at least hung out.


AUSTIN: [cross] That was probably an episode.


ALI: Art.


SYLVIA: [cross] You know what? That was really nice.


AUSTIN: [cross] Let’s put that in the Bluff update, right?


ALI: Art, you’re gonna miss us…[cross] I think I’m the…


ART:  [cross] It’s gonna be a…


AUSTIN: [slight laugh] That’s a very!


ALI: What?


AUSTIN: [laughing silently] That’s just a very presumptuous thing…to say.


ALI: [laughs helplessly] But! It was nice, you know the day before he leaves we get to sit down and spend an hour with us doing fuckin nonsense shit.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm! Mm-hm.


ALI: [laughing] It’s a fond memory…


[SYLVIA laughs along]


ART: You know I’m comin back, right?


ALI: [laughing loudly] I know! But like two weeks is a lot at once.


AUSTIN: Tell that to the ElderHostel.


[ALI wheezes and DRE laughs]


SYLVIA: Yeah, I was gonna say! The siren song of the ElderHostel. You never know.


ALI: God…


ART: I’m not old enough to stay. You have to be 40 [AUSTIN: Oh.] or older, [ALI snorts] so it’s only—I’m only there ‘cause my mom can go!


SYLVIA: Get a fake ID!


ALI: [wheezes] Fuck, I hate you…[cackling]


[SYLVIA laughs]


AUSTIN: [cross] What’s the name of that song—


ART: [cross] [exaggerated deep voice] Hello! I’m 40 years old.


[ALI and SYLVIA continue laughing]


AUSTIN: What’s that name of a song where Wyclef Jean goes Shakira, Shakira!


ALI: Oh, um.


ART: [cross] “Hips Don’t Lie.”


DRE: [cross] Probably a Shakira song.


AUSTIN: Oh! I was thinking it was a Santana song…[amused] We should go to time.is!


[DRE laughs quietly]


ART: [amused] I’m already there.


ALI: What—


SYLVIA: [cross] Okay. I’m here.


DRE: [cross] Art’s gotta pack.


ALI: What the fuck is that song? Is that “Hips Don’t Lie?”


SYLVIA: [cross] Yeah, I think it—I think it’s “Hips Don’t Lie,” yeah.


AUSTIN [cross] It’s “Hips Don’t Lie.” Yeah.


Which is also a bop, honestly.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


DRE: [cross] Mm-hm!


ALI: [cross] Yeah. [tiredly] 45?


DRE: Sure.


AUSTIN: Sure.


[Pause]


[Clap]


We gotta do another one.


ALI: It’s okay—


SYLVIA: Yeah! [laughs] It was…[laughs]


AUSTIN: Top of the minute.


SYLVIA: [laughing] I heard everybody separately.


AUSTIN: Yep!


[Pause]


[Worse clap]


Mine skipped! Mine skipped, I think I got it! I think I got it, [DRE laughs] but it skipped a second.


ALI: It’ll be fine. Sure.


[sighing sounds]


[synth outro music]
