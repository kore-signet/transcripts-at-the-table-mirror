Ali: [laughing]
Sylvia: Huh?
Ali: Hashtag, The Garfield Movie review. “Delightful and charming” [Sylvia laughs], “full to the brim with satire and fun. Chris Pratt honors… truly honors the legacy. You’ll roar with laughter and have a puss-pounding good time.”
Sylvia: [laughing] Yeah…
Janine: [cross] No!
Sylvia: [cross] Yeah?
Ali: “It’s the best Garfield movie ever!”
Austin: [cross] No!
Ali: “A fitting ending, setting up what’s next.”
Sylvia: Every generation deserves their “good things come in bears” [Ali laughs].
Janine and Austin together: Oh my god…
Art: They setting up the GCU?
Ali: I don’t know…
Janine: Yeah, call me when they’re doing an Orson and Friends or whatever movie.
Ali: I know that Garfield was…
Art: [cross] Oh, the farm…jerks… yeah.
Janine: [cross] Yeah…
Ali: Ohhh…
Sylvia: [laughing] The farm jerks!?
Janine: The farm jerks.
Art: US Acres, or something, it was…
Sylvia: Oh yeah, yeah… sure.
Janine: The Garfield and Friends cartoon? It was, like, the other half of that show.
Ali: Oh, OK.
Janine: Half of it was Garfield, and half of it was, like, a pig and some birds…
Ali: Yeah. Yeah.
Janine: The duck sucked. I don’t know why the ducks always suck in these things.
Jack: Bad animals.
Art: [cross] Maybe it’s the rhyme?
Janine: [cross] Name one good cartoon duck!
Austin: Daffy!
Janine: No! He’s an asshole!
Sylvia: Nah, Daffy rules, this is a Daffy respect zone.
Austin: [cross] Daffy rules!
Janine: [cross] No, I… Listen! OK! OK! Shushushushush! [Sylvia laughs] Daffy’s cool, but he’s an asshole-type character.
Austin: Yeah!
Janine: That’s my point, is all cartoon ducks are asshole-type characters.
Sylvia: Fair.
Austin: What about the… the… Duck Tales kids?
Art: Yeah, the Duck Tales…
Sylvia: Nooo.
Janine: They’re, like, nosy little wieners!
Sylvia: I would call them assholes.
Ali: [cross] They’re just… they’re teen protagonists… what?
Austin: [cross] They’re children.
Andrew: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Janine: [cross] Also, they don’t look like ducks…
Sylvia: [cross] Kids can be assholes!
Janine: They look like baby chickens
Andrew: [cross] Launchpad McQuack: not an asshole.
Ali: [cross] No! They… You’re out of your mind!
Austin: [cross] You’re [laughs].
Janine: They don’t… they don’t have the right beaks!
Ali: You’re… you’re trying to win this argument, and I’m sorry, but… [laughs - Austin laughs]
Janine: [cross] They don’t have the right beaks…
Art: [cross] It’s called Duck Tales!
Ali: They look like ducks!
Janine: They don’t have the right beaks: they have sharp beaks, ducks don’t have sharp beaks.
Andrew: [cross] No they don’t!
Ali: [cross] What are you talking about!?
Andrew: [cross] What are you talking about!?
Art: [incredulous] Huey, Dewey, and Louie?
Austin: [cross, incredulous] Have sharp beaks!?
Art: [cross] Are we talking about the same ducks?
Austin: What are we talking about?
Janine: OK, wait nevermind, I was thinking… I think I was thinking of the little chicken hawk from Warner Bros. [laughs]
Austin: OK…
Ali: OK, I’ll grant you this: in the recent one they look a little pointy. They had, like, an upgraded design.
Austin: But that’s just the world is pointier than it used to be.
Ali: Right, yeah. This is just that.
Janine: [cross] Yeah…
Sylvia: [cross] Damn, ain’t that true!
Austin: You know?
Janine: I still think they’re annoying? Which counts. I want, like, a nice…
Sylvia: Yeah.
Janine: [cross] Gentle, well-behaved duck.
Andrew: [cross] Launchpad!
Austin: There are lots of other… Yeah, Launchpad is, like, a nice guy, right? 
Janine: He’s a goof. I don’t know.
Sylvia: [cross] Forget his ass… [Ali chuckles].
Austin: Damn!
Janine: Is he a pelican? Why is his beak like that?
Austin: My god… [laughs].
Sylvia: You’re really hung up on the beaks!
Janine: He’s got a huge…
Andrew: [cross] He’s a duck!
Janine: [cross] He’s got a big… thing.
Austin: He has a big chin! Oh my god, I can’t believe we’re body-shaming Launchpad! [Ali laughs]
Janine: [cross] He isn’t a duck! That’s not where the duck’s chin is!
Andrew: [cross] Maybe he’s an anthropomorphic duck?
Janine: I would say he’s a pelican or something.
Austin: No, he’s not a pelican!
Art: His last name is McQuack!
Janine: Pelicans might quack, I don’t know. [cross] Cartoon logic: It doesn’t have to make sense.
Austin: [cross] Oh my god…
Andrew: Oh, OK, but his chin has to look exactly perfect for it to make sense to you! [laughs]
Janine: He’s also not Scottish, or whatever!
Austin: He’s not Scottish! The only one who’s Scottish is the patriarch of the family, that’s the whole thing! He’s old money!
Janine: [cross] OK! OK! OK! But I’m I’m saying… I’m saying if you’re saying his name is McQuack, so he must be a duck…
Austin: [cross] Oh my god…
Janine: Well, it’s also McQuack. [pause] And Scrooge is McDuck. But only Scrooge is the Scottish one? OK…
Austin: He’s Scottish American! He’s, like… a World War Two pilot bomber guy!
Ali: They’re second generation Americans, or whatever.
Austin: Yeah!
Janine: I’m just saying… I don’t think these rules that you’re applying necessarily apply. [some laughter]
Austin: [cross] Unbelievable…
Art: As laid down in the eight-part Godfather parody [laughter] that they did in Duck Tales…
Janine: Also.
Austin: That’s right!
Janine: Maybe Launchpad was adopted? We don’t know. [cross] Maybe he married and took his spouse’s name?
Sylvia: [cross] Oh my god… He’s a…
Austin: I bet we do know, is the thing. I bet we do know.
Sylvia: Oh no, sorry, I got things mixed up, and I thought you… I got things mixed up and I thought Janine was implying that Scrooge McDuck and Launchpad McQuack got married. [chuckles - Janine, Ali, and Austin laugh] I just lost the plot for a second, ignore me.
Austin: There’s got to be a good duck… just a classically, like… a kind duck in cartoons.
Art: What about Darkwing Duck?
Janine: [cross] No, he’s also an asshole! Also, Launchpad was just his sidekick apparently.
Austin: [cross] Hmm… no… yeah…
Andrew: Darkwing Duck’s kid?
Janine: Or was his sidekick at some point.
Austin: Yeah, Darkwing Duck’s kid was very kind, right?
Janine: Ehh…? I don’t remember Darkwing Duck’s kid.
Sylvia: [cross] Is Daisy Duck an asshole?
Austin: [cross] It’s his kid, right? It’s, like… his…
Andrew: Yeah, he has a daughter, or something.
Austin: Is it his daughter? Or is it, like…
Andrew: Or maybe it’s his niece.
Austin: That’s what I’m thinking… I’m thinking like… I thought it was like a niece. But maybe I’m wrong? It’s been a minute.
Sylvia: So in the descrip… 
Austin: [cross] Adopted daughter.
Sylvia: I’m on the Wikipedia page for ‘List of Fictional Ducks in Animation’, and I think Janine might be right.
Janine: Yeah! I’m saying!
Austin: [cross] People don’t like ducks!
Janine: Thank you!
[00:05:00]
Austin: That’s the problem.
Janine: [cross] People love… bullshit!
Austin: People don’t like ducks!
Janine: We all love ducks!
Austin: Then why do they keep making asshole duck cartoons?
Keith: [cross] I love ducks…
Andrew: [cross] I like ducks… Cos I think the… progenitors. 
Janine: Because there’s a conspiracy.
Andrew: [cross] The progenitors are assholes.
Art: Oh boy…
Austin: OK, what about The Mighty Ducks, from the Mighty Duck cartoon?
Art: No one’s seen that, Austin.
Andrew: [cross] I saw that.
Keith: [cross] I’ve seen that.
Art: Really?
Austin: Let’s go…
Keith: That was on when I was a kid.
Andrew: [cross] It was a long time ago, but I’ve seen it.
Sylvia: Yeah.
Andrew: Yeah, they had, like… cool vehicles and they transformed into, like, weird duck armor. 
Austin: That’s right.
Ali: What about this One Piece character, is this guy alright?
Keith: Is there a One Piece duck?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Probably.
Ali: Karoo.
Keith: Oh yeah.
Austin: Can I see this guy? Where is this guy?
Ali: He looks fine? He has, like, a Chocobo quality, which I find interesting? I’m putting this into Scheduling.
Austin: Oh my goodness! Look at this guy!
Ali: Yeah…
Sylvia: Oh yeah! No, this guy rules, this guy rules; this guy’s great.
Janine: [cross] Is that a guy though? Or is that a pet?
Sylvia: [cross] But this is, like… a Chocobo, this is a Chocobo.
Ali: Oh, OK.
Austin: Does he not have… does he not…
Ali: He’s a mascot, he doesn’t talk, he doesn’t dance.
Sylvia: No, he’s… I believe…
Keith: [sarcastic] That’s not a man? The thing with a barrel with a straw around its neck, that’s not a guy?
Sylvia: Yeah, so this is…
Austin: One Piece? I don’t know how One Piece works…
Sylvia: This is from my favorite… the one One Piece arc I look back on fondly, so I remember him.
Art: Wait, who drinks out of that straw?
Keith: He does, the duck do.
Sylvia: [cross] I think he do.
Austin: [cross] That’s for him, for sure.
Art: That’s for a guy, though… [Ali laughs]
Keith: No…
Austin: [cross] I see what you’re saying.
Sylvia: [cross] So you’re arguing that he’s a guy.
Andrew: Like, it’s a Saint Bernard duck?
Janine: He has to reach it, he has a long neck.
Sylvia: Saint Mallard…
Art: The Saint Bernards aren’t drinking out of their own barrels though…
Sylvia: I’m pretty proud of that one.
Austin: That was good.
Janine: To find a nice duck, I really feel like you’ve got to, like… [sighs] Oh wait, I guess, like… The Ugly… No, The Ugly Duckling’s a swan… Fuck!
Andrew: Yeah.
Keith: [cross] Damn.
Austin: [cross] Damn, they got you on the whole thing, that was kind of a…
Art: [laughing] And the other ducks are jerks in that!
Sylvia: That’s true!
Austin: [cross] Yeah, those ducks suck.
Janine: [laughing] Yeah! The ducks suck in that!
Keith: Are we saying that Huey, Dewey, and Louie are not nice?
Austin: That is what Janine is saying.
Janine: [cross] Uhh…
Art: [cross] Janine is asserting that they are not.
Janine: They’re, like… TV-annoying kids.
Austin: At least the initial… The initial argument was that they weren’t ducks. So…
[laughter from several people]
Janine: So… Well… OK, I was… I don’t know why I’m… There’s definitely, I’m thinking of, like… four little white baby birds who have sharp beaks [Sylvia laughs], but it might be like a… I might be confusing it with a Warner Bros thing, because I was a Warner Bros kid. I wasn’t a Disney kid in that way.
Austin: Hmm…
Janine: The only nice duck I can think of right now is Jemima Puddleduck? 
Sylvia: Who?
Janine: And she’s kind of stupid…
Andrew: [cross] Does she have that syrup?
Austin: What about those ducks from…
Janine: [cross] Jemima Puddleduck is Beatrix Potter’s duck, who is, like… an old and gentle lady who makes some mistakes.
Austin: What about the ducks from X-DuckX?
Keith: [cross] [laughing] A gentle lady who makes some mistakes?
Austin: What about these guys? [laughing] What about these guys from the French cartoon series X-DuckX?
Janine: Eww! No!
Austin: I think this might be racist against ducks!
Sylvia: You did not need to tell me this was French… [Austin, Andrew, and Keith laugh]
Andrew: Whoa, look at his mouth!
Sylvia: Although that is German, in the second image.
Janine: Yeah…
Austin: It is French, it’s a French show. 
Sylvia: It’s definitely French.
Austin: But it’s by a Belgian creator [laughs]…
Sylvia: [cross] That also makes perfect sense.
Janine: [cross] Oh, so it’s… yes, yes… straddling the cultures.
Keith: This is straddling those two cultures?
Austin: [cross] Apparently, this company is in the United States.
Art: [cross] What about Daisy Duck?
Austin: Yeah, what about Daisy Duck?
Ali: Yeah…
Sylvia: Yeah, what about Daisy Duck?
Keith: I’m still on Huey, Dewey, and Louie, I think that those are nice boys who torment their horrible billionaire uncle.
Ali: [cross] Yeah!
Austin: Yeah!
Andrew: Yeah!
Janine: Well, OK, see… [chuckles] when the word torment comes up [chuckles]...
Austin: Some people have got to be tormented!
Janine: I’m just saying.
Sylvia: [cross] See, that’s the thing…
Andrew: [cross] Yeah! 
Keith: [cross] Some people have got to be tormented… The man who swims in a pile of gold, in a room full of gold… he can be tormented. 
Sylvia: Yeah…
Janine: “Jemima Puddleduck is not allowed to keep the eggs that she lays at the farm…”
Sylvia: [cross] Yo!
Andrew: [cross] That’s fucked up…
Janine: “So she seeks out a nesting place in the forest. A charming gentleman fox talks her into nesting at his house…”
Sylvia: [cross] No, don’t do that…
Janine: “On a mysteriously ample supply of feathers.”
Keith: [cross] Wow, he’s nice. He seems nice.
Janine: “He sends the naive Jemima out to collect traditional herbs for stuffing a duck, saying it is for an omelette. The farm colleague, Kep, is able to see through the fox’s plan and rescues Jemima.”
Keith: [cross] Hmm… Sorry, his excuse…?
Janine: “She was eventually able to hatch four ducklings back at the farm.” 
Keith: She wants to lay her egg and keep it, and his excuse was: “Hey, why don’t you get these things? They’re for an omelette I’m going to make…”
Janine: [laughing, cross] Yeah!
Keith: “No reason!” It’s not really… it’s not really…
Janine: [cross] It’s like I said: she made some bad choices.
Keith: Yeah, OK. Oh, I thought you were saying that it’s her… the owner, the human that made some bad choices. 
Janine: No, Jemima Puddleduck is an individual.
Keith: So, it was Beatrix Potter who made the bad decisions.
Janine: [cross] Self-actualizing.
Austin: [cross] What about Wade Duck?
Janine: No.
Austin: What about Wade Duck? The duck from the Garfield cartoon? That has the little, like, inflatable tube?
Janine: That’s what started this! He sucks! That’s what started this whole tangent, was that guy! [Art laughs]
Austin: I wasn’t here… I wasn’t here… I wasn’t here for that part.
Keith: What does he do?
Andrew: Wait, which guy?
Austin: He’s like a… 
Janine: [cross] He’s angry!
Austin: He’s like nebbish and ner… no, isn’t he nervous? Isn’t his whole thing being, like… an anxious, nervous [drowned out by other voices]...
Janine: [cross] I guess, but he’s also angry a lot.
[two or three others speak at the same time, but all drown each other out].
Art: Because this started with the Garfield review.
Austin: I see… Puss-pounding.
Sylvia: Yeah, yeah, the puss-pounding good time.
Austin: Yeah…
Janine: Oh god…
Austin: Uh-huh? [laughs]
[00:10:00]
Andrew: Huh…
Ali: Anyway, Garfield was at a, like, food festival in Brooklyn this weekend?
Sylvia: The Garfield? 
Janine: [cross] You were eating Garfield?
Keith: [cross] That makes sense, he belongs there.
Ali: No, he was just visiting, like… a press event.
Austin: [cross] He was hanging.
Keith: [cross] Well yeah, cos he loves food.
Sylvia: [laughing] Like the President?
Ali: No, like… a press event.
Sylvia: [laughing] Oh, okay! [several people laugh]
Keith: You know how the President visits things? Garfield does that too.
[more laughter]
Sylvia: Oh, I was like yeah, Garfield’s running, you know?
Janine: Cool, cool, cool…
Ali: Kissing babies, taking pictures.
Austin: Here’s how Garfield can still win.
Ali: [sighing] I want Garfield to win!
Austin: Yep, we all want Garfield to win, at this point.
Andrew: Yeah. Hey… What’s uh…? Oh, that’s his foot, nevermind.
Austin: Alright!
Janine: [laughing] Donald Duck Creamer! [laughs] Uhh… Yes, Jack? Oh, Jack’s not here.
Andrew: Oh, wait: do you… do you pour… is that a pitcher?
Janine: Yeah, it’s, like, a creamer.
Austin: You fill them up with… yeah.
Janine: [cross] Cream. You fill them up with cream? [some groans]
Keith: So he spews it into your drink.
Janine: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah, and then it comes out and… yeah.
Art: Is there a hole in the top? Is that where I’m getting the cream in?
Austin: Yeah, yeah, right in his back.
Janine: Oh yeah, his back opens. You can see that there’s a little rift…
Art: [cross] Uh-huh.
Keith: [cross] Yeah, yeah, I can see.
Austin: [cross] Why is it like that?
Janine: [cross] The arms freak me out.
Art: [cross] But then he spits it out of his mouth.
Austin: [laughing] Yeah! His arms bend backwards like in Twin Peaks [Sylvia laughs], it’s a little fucked up!
Janine: [cross] I wouldn’t want to pick that up… 
Ali: [cross] He’s bowing… 
Janine: [cross] I just wouldn’t trust that to…
Keith: [cross] You can tell that this is not a nice duck.
Ali: [cross] He’s doing, like… a military bow.
Austin: No…
Janine: [cross] No… [Ali laughs]
Andrew: [cross] Is he?
Keith: A military bow?
Ali: [still laughing] You know how military guys put their hands behind their back?
[short pause]
Austin: Not like that!
Keith: [cross] You mean bow or, like… he’s at ease?
Andrew: [cross] Yes…? But…
Art: [cross] I don’t think they do bow after that! [Ali laughs again]
Keith: Yeah, they don’t bow.
Sylvia: The arms going back thing…
Austin: [cross] Military guys famously bow with their arms bent back so you could lift them up easily! [Austin, Keith, and Ali laugh]
Ali: Yeah, for the cream!
Keith: For the cream!
Austin: The military cream. There was a question? I heard?
Sylvia: I was just going to say that the arms bent back thing just made me think of, instead of Who Killed Laura Palmer? it’s Who Ate My Lasagne?
Austin: [laughing] Did they do that episode? They should have done that episode. Of the…
Sylvia: It’s damn fine lasagne!
Austin: That’s a gimme! These are all gimmes.
Sylvia: Yeah. Odie as Gordon Cole?
Austin: Yeah… uh-huh?
Art: Backwards talking Nermal.
Sylvia: Can Nermal speak? I don’t know much about Garfield’s sort of cosmology in the world.
Janine: Yeah…
Sylvia: OK.
Janine: Nermal… Odie’s the only one who doesn’t speak.
Sylvia: [laughing] Cosmology!
Austin: Which is weird.
Andrew: Oh yeah, it is. Odie is the only one, huh?
Sylvia: It’s the Pluto of his world.
Andrew: Sure.
Austin: So, I’ve got a Reddit post to read, while we’re still waiting on Jack, I believe? 
Jack: No, I’m here.
Austin: Oh, are you? Well, too bad, I’m going to read this one anyway. [some laughter] “Lasagne is disgusting.”
Jack: [cross] What bullshit! No!
Sylvia: [cross] No…
Austin: “So, I really don’t like lasagne. It is layer knock-off spaghetti with some disgusting stupid rubber cheese on it. It tastes absolutely disgusting, why would anyone on earth think “Mmmm, yes! I am hungry, let’s eat some lasagne ‘cos it tastes good!” Like, why would you do this? Fuck lasagne! All my homies hate lasagne! Lasagne is stupid. Cringe spaghetti. Good not cringe…”
Sylvia: [cross] “Cringe spaghetti”!
Austin: “If you really like layer food, go eat an onion [Andrew laughs], and not a fucking disgusting lasagne shit. If I’m ever going to rule the world, I will make lasagne illegal, and anybody who makes it will be shot! I fucking hate lasagne! AAAAGGGHHHH!”
Keith: Something’s wrong with his mouth.
Sylvia: [cross] Wow!
Janine: [cross] “If you want layer food”?
Austin: [laughing] “If you want layer food.”
Keith: You can tell that this is the most insane person on earth, because I like onions, but it is not a suitable replacement to lasagne. 
[short pause]
Andrew: Oh, it’s got layers, so it’s the same thing.
Keith: Right, it’s the same thing. What you want out of the food is the way it’s… if it’s layered or not layered, it’s not the flavors. 
Andrew: If you don’t like lasagne? Go eat a fucking club sandwich! It’s the same thing!
Janine: What I’m getting from this is that this person, in their household, whoever’s preparing the lasagne is doing a poor job, and they just want spaghetti instead.
Austin: [cross] Yeah… is doing a bad job.
Andrew: Yeah.
Keith: [cross] Even bad lasagne…
Ali: [cross] They’re making one of those cottage cheese lasagnes.
Austin: I tried to find out what this person’s account was like? They have been suspended, and a SubReddit they made, Lasagne Hate, has been banned.
Sylvia: Good!
Keith: Wow. Good! [Austin laughs]
Andrew: [laughing] Wow!
Sylvia: Anti-Italian sentiment.
Janine: I can imagine myself saying things like that about steak when I was a teenager, because I was just being given steak…
Austin: [cross] Bad steak… That’s sad to me.
Keith: [cross] I was also being given bad steak… Yeah, me too.
Janine: [cross] Very, very, very overcooked in an oven.
Art: Yeah, and you were like… “Go eat an onion!” [Ali laughs]
Keith: Go eat an onion, yeah!
Art: I’d hope that this link to the Olive Garden-Garfield Movie crossover event would have a preview image, but it does not.
Austin: Oh, it doesn’t… Great!
Ali: Oh, he’s chilling though.
Austin: He’s chilling.
Keith: Fuck steak! Cringe burgers! [Austin laughs] If you want a flat food, go eat a salmon! [Janine laughs]
Ali: Before we get started, could I pose a question to the cast?
Austin, Janine, and Keith: Yeah.
Ali: Given that we have to avoid Chris Pratt in the Garfield Movie, what dub would you watch? Is it Italian?
[00:14:58]
Sylvia: Oh…
Austin: [cross] Oh my god…
Keith: [cross] French.
Janine: [cross] I think for me it’s always French.
Austin: [cross] I also thought French, I don’t know why though. He’s not French.
Janine: I have some academic reasons for picking French.
Keith: Garfield scans as French to me.
Ali: Really?
Janine: French… I feel like the French have a thing for cartoons in such a way that I would just trust the performance better. I’d trust the standards better. They have been importing and exporting cartoons very aggressively…
Ali: [cross] Well, they made The Moomins…
Janine: Exactly, exactly, you see? [Ali laughs]
Austin: OK.
Janine: And the rabbits, which, they don’t talk. But you know, it’s still…
Ali: [agreeing] Hmm…
Janine: There’s an energy.
Andrew: Sure. Those… Daft Punk music videos.
Art: Umm… Do we know what Garfield sounds like in Japanese? 
Austin: That is exactly where I’m at, Art. I’m looking to see who dubs…
Janine: I bet he’s, like, more nasal.  
Austin: Maybe? Maybe.
Janine: They love a… nasal…
Ali: [cross] He’s played by like a hot guy.
Keith: [cross] Yeah, I bet he sounds like Goku…
Austin: OK…
Janine: [makes strange nasal sound] It’s going to be something like that.
Austin: [cross] This is a song, I don’t want that. Here’s a scene from… I don’t know what this is. I don’t… [Janine laughs] I do not know what this is… This kind of has a bop though. The Garfield Show, episode thirty four. This is Japanese Garfield.
Janine: D’Argo Media, this is a French cartoon, isn’t it?
Austin: I think that… yeah.
Janine: Yeah. I’m saying.
Austin: He’s, like…
Ali: He sounds cute!
Janine: I was right!
Austin: He’s a little nasal-y, but he’s also, like… [Janine makes nasal sound] Back of his cheeks?
Janine: Yeah…
Austin: Which is right. I think the thing is John would be great in Japanese. 
Ali: OK, sure… sure…
Art: Yeah. I think I want my Japanese Garfield to have a Toshiro Mifuni to him, like a…
Austin: Ohhh… [Sylvia laughs]
Art: [gravelly and bombastic voice] I want him to talk like this!
Austin: RIght, yeah? Uh-huh.
Ali: Yeah.
Austin: That’s fair. [Ali laughs]
Keith: Is this just how Garfield is now? Just, like, this weird puffy CG? Is that what Garfield is now?
Austin: Well, he’s a comic. He’s a 2D comic who appears in your local newspaper’s comic and games section, primarily.
Janine: If Beetle Bailey was more of a thing, he’d be like this too.
Keith: I… I just want a flat Garfield.
Austin: Let’s all read today’s Garfield.
Janine: If you want a flat Garfield, go eat a salmon.
Sylvia: Damn! [Keith laughs]
Art: Boom!
Austin: I’m going to paste today’s Garfield, this seems to be… from today’s… it’s a Sunday paper, so it’s a big one.
Ali: Oh… Garfield!
Austin: Garfield, and he’s sleeping: ZZZZZZ. It’s a weird zee, I don’t know about that zee.
Jack: Is this his waking up? His sleep has been ruined.
Janine: [cross] Is this supposed to be… chattering?
Austin: [cross] Oh, interesting, I see. “Want to go for a walk in the park, Garfield?” “Why, what…?”
Sylvia: He’s not a dog.
Ali: [cross] Garfield was at the park in real life today. 
Sylvia: Oh my god! [Ali laughs] 
Janine: They knew!
Ali: You know, I’m just saying…
Sylvia: No, you’re totally right to say.
Austin: John loves the park because of nature. 
Janine: I don’t believe that. 
Austin: And…
Janine: I don’t believe he loves nature.
Austin: Well. I don’t know what’s going on in his life these days…
Keith: Look, people have ups and downs in their life. [Austin laughs]
Austin: Exactly where I went Keith! That’s exactly where I went! Garfield likes the park because there’s a hotdog vendor, who’s probably yelling “hotdogs!” and who has a nice good-smell hotdog? [Ali laughs]
Janine: The hotdog vendor is part of nature too.
Austin: That’s right.
Janine: Just a more complicated part.
Austin: That’s right.
Ali: On GoComics.com, CodyCab — seventeen hours ago — says “I had a footlong hotdog at a waterpark today, really good stuff!” 
Austin: Damn…
[Keith laughs]
Andrew: [unintelligible]
Austin: [cross] [unintelligible] says: “funny how the hotdog vendor’s wearing similar clothes to John’s” [laughs] [Ali and Art laugh] Yeah dude!
Keith: That’s funny.
Art: Well, Jim Davis must be a hundred years old and not drawing this any more.
Austin: Jim is not doing this.
Janine: [cross] Yeah, no…
Austin: There’s a whole machine back there.
Janine: [cross] Paws Inc.
Art: Garfield Studios?
Austin: Yeah.
Janine: Paws Inc. was acquired by… 
Andrew: [cross] The Garfield Industrial Complex.
Janine: …someone, and they shut down the, like, main studio for it. Cos they had, like… a cute little office? 
Keith: [cross] Jim Davis is seventy-eight.
Janine: Yeah, he’s still alive, he’s still kicking.
Austin: [cross] GarfieldFan90 says: “I hate hotdogs.”
Art: [cross] He’s never written a funny joke in his whole life.
Austin: Wow!
Keith: Yeah, that’s pretty… that’s pretty much true.
Austin: Never?
Keith: [cross] Garfield is not, I mean…
Art: [cross] If you can find a funny Garfield strip…
Janine: Have you read those ones about the bug from before Garfield?
Austin: Oh, the one where he, like… dies?
Art: That’s not funny!
Andrew: That’s not… that’s fucked up, bro.
Austin: It’s funny to me.
Sylvia: It’s kind of funny…
Janine: [cross] The dog cum one’s pretty funny.
Andrew: [cross - laughing] “It’s funny to me…!”
Sylvia: The dog cum one’s fake…
Austin: No, no, no, no, no… 
Janine: It’s not fake…
Austin: It’s not fake.
Janine: He just thought it meant something different than it did.
Sylvia: Oh, OK.
Austin: [cross] He’s… yeah. It’s real.
Sylvia: [cross] I was told it was fake. 
Janine: No, it’s real. He just said that he grew up on a farm, and when farm animals are going to get pregnant, you give them, like… a nutrient drink or something?
Austin: Right.
Janine: And he assumed there would be something similar for dogs.
Sylvia: Oh… [cross] And instead…
Janine: [cross - laughing] And that’s the nutrient drink.
Sylvia: …this happened.
Austin: Right.
Sylvia: Sure…
Austin: Which I think is a lie. [laughs] I think he knew what he was doing!
Sylvia: Yeah… I’m inclined to agree with you. 
Art: Paws Inc. employs nearly fifty artists.
Austin: Yeah. [cross] Garfield is merchandise, that’s the thing.
Sylvia: [cross] Paws Inc?
Austin: Garfield is t-shirts, Garfield is… City City, like.
[00:20:03]
Art: I mean, this is what Bill Waterson didn’t want Calvin & Hobbes to do…
Austin: [cross] Right, exactly.
Janine: [cross] Yeah…
Art: And that’s why he became an… obsessive recluse.
Janine: But this is also, like, Tom & Jerry’s having this huge resurgence, especially in Japan? There’s so much Tom & Jerry merch in Japan right now.
[lots of murmuring in agreement]
Ali: [cross] Snoopy too.
Sylvia: [cross] I’ve heard Curious George also.
Janine: Snoopy’s been there for a while but, like… they… yeah…
Austin: Oh, Snoopy the god, like…
Keith: The big difference between Tom & Jerry, Snoopy, and Garfield, is that Tom & Jerry and Snoopy are good, and Garfield sucks.
Sylvia: Yo…
Ali: Oh, come on.
Andrew: Damn!
Sylvia: No, I think Keith’s kind of spitting, but…
Keith: I’m a hundred percent… look, Garfield is a fun design… and that is it.
Janine: I never fucking got Snoopy. I don’t get it.
Art: Again: there’s no funny Garfield material.
Ali: I’m going to get so much fucking merchandise of Snoopy’s fat brother Olaf… it’s gonna be… [laughs]
Sylvia: Let’s go!
Ali: I’m so excited!
Austin: Yeah… Olaf’s great.
Ali: I love Olaf. [cross] He was introduced on my birthday!
Austin: [cross] The whole Snoopy family is great.
Ali: We’re spiritually connected.
Austin: Aww! [Ali laughs]
Keith: [laughing] I found a good… I found a good Garfield cartoon.
Ali: [laughing] Yes Keith?
Keith: I found a good one.
Austin: This a dub? What have we got here? Oh, oh… OK… “Help! I can’t swim!”
Keith: This is, I think, as good as you’re gonna get. [Austin, Janine, and Ali laugh]
Austin: Not funny! This is what I’m saying, bro!
Sylvia: Damn! Now that actually hits.
Austin: I’m fucking always saying this!
Ali: Actually, wait, OK, everybody Google Garfield and then their birthday.
Austin: Ooh.
Sylvia: Oh my god.
Austin: Their, like… original birthday, their first birthday.
Sylvia: [laughing] Your OG birthday!
Ali: The day you were born.
Austin: The day I was born.
Andrew: Oh, OK. Garfield…
Austin: OK, I’m reading it.
Janine: With the year or without the year?
Several people at once: With the year.
Austin: That’s what I was asking.
Jack: OK, so… my one is… my one is frankly baffling?
Keith: Yeah, mine too. [Sylvia laughs]
Ali: Mine’s alright? I like mine.
Austin: [cross] Mine’s in the middle of an ongoing thing where he’s on a stage.
Sylvia: [cross] I’m just linking mine.
Janine: Mine is about birthdays.
Ali, Austin, and Art together: Whoa!
Keith: Wow!
Jack: Oh, the musical socks one is kind of… that’s cute.
Sylvia: I kind of love mine? [Ali laughs]
Andrew: Mine’s about depression, I think.
Janine: They’re all about depression.
Art: I’m so old that the characters aren’t all modelled yet.
Sylvia: “Titty-boom, titty-boom, titty-boom, titty-boom”? [Ali laughs]
Austin: Yeah… So it’s supposed to be a rim shot, but Odie is, like, going for it, you know what I mean?
Andrew: Ah! Sure he is! [laughs]
Austin: Oh my god, the coffee spilt… Art, you were just talking about spilling coffee!
Art: Yeah.
Austin: Also, the one… yours is wild! [several people laugh] They are fucking—are you kidding me? Now, wait a second!
Sylvia: That last panel’s deranged!
Art: Look at how long John’s tongue is! [several people laugh]
Keith: It’s longer than Garfield!
Sylvia: Good for that veterinarian. [Austin and Janine laugh]
Austin: It’s wild! That second panel is good…. This is a good comic! [laughs] Both of them considering the spilled coffee?
Ali: It’s alright! I recommend doing this for the Peanuts too, because that’s how I found out about Olaf. And it’s fun to do.
Austin: Oh, I see.
Keith: I think mine… I think mine might be the worst one here.
Austin: Uh… yeah, yours is not good.
Keith: [cross] It’s just nothing… It’s just nothing.
Austin: [cross] Yours is bad… Yeah.
Keith: It’s, like… not even an idea.
Andrew: [cross] Yeah, it is nothing.
Jack: Oh my god… so my birthday Peanuts comic is great. [laughing] I’m sharing this now. It’s a real doozy.
Keith: I guarantee half of ours at least will be good, for the Peanuts.
Jack: [cross] OK, this one’s mine.
Austin: [cross] Peanuts just goes, right?
Ali: [laughing] Yes!
Art: That’s great.
Janine: I don’t get it! I don’t understand!
Keith: Look at… he does it…
Ali: It’s just funny!
Janine: What?
Art: Bump.
Austin: Bump.
Andrew: Bump.
Austin: Oh wow, I got kind of like… a companion one to Jack’s Bump. I got Bonk. [Jack and Keith laugh]
Jack: The… I’m not going to describe Austin’s one panel-for-panel, but it really is just Snoopy getting hit by a hot air balloon, and that is as funny as you would think it is [Ali laughs].
Sylvia: I’m… I’m fucking crazy about my one, oh my god. [Ali laughs] Guess who’s there, Ali?
Art: [cross] Things are really down on this one.
Ali: Yes! [Andrew and Sylvia laugh]
Jack: What’s yours, Sylvi? Let me see. Oh, Olaf.
Keith: [cross] I remember Snoopy’s, like… fuzzy cousin, his fat cousin, and funny cousin.
Janine: Oh yeah!
Ali: He has a, like… whole family, I love them.
Janine: [cross] They’re more interesting to me than Snoopy, I don’t… I don’t get Snoopy.
Jack: [cross] “We don’t know how to write, do we?” is so good.
Austin: Fuzzy is so good, I want that dog for real. What’s his little sister’s name?
Keith: I like mine too. Why… why are mine…? I don’t know what links you’re clicking that you’re all getting shareable ones? But mine are not.
Ali: Oh, I’m just doing…
Andrew: [cross] I’m just screen-shotting mine.
Janine: [cross] I’m just screen-shotting… yeah. I… Ugh… Eww. [Ali laughs] I just… 
Keith: Alright.
Janine: I just don’t like Peanuts?
Sylvia: Wow… I mean, I’m allergic and I like them, so… 
Janine: I never have. I just never got it, I don’t know… 
Art: I’ve done this one before, and I really love the phrase “Sly digs don’t become you, ma’am.” 
Austin: Yeah…
[Ali laughs]
Keith: Yeah…
[Jack laughs]
Keith: Alright, I’m screen-shotting, here we go. OK. I have another very physical one.
Janine: I do like Peppermint Patty.
Austin: Peppermint Patty’s great.
Jack: [cross] Patty’s really good.
Keith: [cross] I love Linus, Linus is really my favourite character besides Snoopy.
[00:25:00]
Keith: He’s always saying crazy shit.
Ali: Yeah.
[Andrew and Jack laugh]
Jack: I like how mean Lucy is.
Keith: Yeah…
Jack: That’s kind of funny?
[pause]
Austin: Yeah, these are all good. [Sylvia laughs] These are all solid.
Art: Yeah, Charles Shultz is a more talented person than Jim Davis. [Ali laughs]
Sylvia: Yeah.
Keith: [cross] Better design too, same piece.
Art: [cross] The artwork is also better, if we’re scoring on that.
Austin: No tongues in these though. No weird long tongue.
Janine: [cross] I think the real thing is… I was a Far Side kid.
Sylvia: Oh, OK.
Keith: [cross] Far Side smashed all of these, by far.
Andrew: [cross] Oh, Far Side…
Sylvia: [cross] I was a Calvin & Hobbes kid.
Keith: I’ve never read almost a single Calvin & Hobbes.
Sylvia: That’s crazy!
Andrew: That is crazy.
Sylvia: I think you’d like them.
Keith: I never heard of it until I was in high school, and I had friends who were, like… “Oh, I love Calvin & Hobbes…” and I was, like… “What are you even talking about?”
Art: It’s weird, because Calvin is a Keith character.
Jack: Yep!
Sylvia: Very much so.
Jack: Absolutely! This is my…
Austin: I don’t have a birthday Calvin & Hobbes, because it hadn’t started yet?
Jack: My birthday Calvin & Hobbes is not good… I looked it up.
Sylvia: [cross] I’ve got one…
Art: [cross] Yeah, it doesn’t start until…
Austin: I didn’t realise it didn’t start until late ‘85, that’s wild. 
Art: Yeah…
Austin: Huh?
[pause]
Jack: This is my favourite Far Side. It’s not on my birthday, I’m just sharing it because it’s my favourite one.
Sylvia: Is it Cow Tools?
Jack: It’s not Cow Tools…
Sylvia: [cross] Cow Tools is my favourite one…
Keith: [cross] I love Cow Tools.
Jack: Though I love Cow Tools. This one is my favourite one.
Keith: I had the fun experience of loving Cow Tools before knowing the controversy around it? [laughter in background]
Jack: Mine is… it’s a man in an aeroplane seat, like… a passenger seat? And the caption is: “Fumbling for his recline button, Ted unwittingly instigated disaster.” And he’s accidentally flicked the switch between “Wings stay on,” and “wings fall off.” [Keith and Janine laugh].
Austin: I’m sorry, there was a… there was a controversy around Cow Tools?
Jack: Oh, people just didn’t understand it.
Keith: People… people wrote in in huge numbers being, like, “I don’t get it, what is the joke? Why is…?” [Ali laughs] “What are the tools? What are you trying to say?”
Austin: Great. They’re cow tools!
Keith: Yeah, and I think his response was just: “If cows made tools, they just wouldn’t be very good,” is basically what he said.
Austin: Yeah, they’re cow tools.
Keith: Yeah.
Andrew: Makes sense.
Austin: Makes sense.
Sylvia: Can’t fault the logic.
Austin: That’s right.
Keith: Another controversial one was the one where, uh… It was an image of a dog’s dream, and in the dream, the dog gets the car, but then doesn’t really know what to do with it once he gets it?
Sylvia: Like Joker…
Keith: It looks like he’s fucking the car? And people wrote in going, like, “This is disgusting!”
Sylvia: Yo… [Jack laughs]
Austin: Oh, I see!
Keith: Supposedly, it was just a mistake.
Austin: Yeah…
Jack: [laughing] This one’s really good.
Austin: I get it, I do see what you mean. It do look like that. [Keith laughs]
Sylvia: Oh yeah! He’s fucking the shit outta that car! Wow!
Ali: [cross] Yeah! He’s… [laughs]
[laughter continues]
Austin: When Car Chasers Dream!
Sylvia: [cross] God! That was not…! Yeah!
Austin: [cross] Car chaser’s dream, baby!
Ali: I feel like, after the fact, they were, like… “No, he’s not fucking the car!” [laughs, others laugh]
Sylvia: This is redefining the ‘I like Ferrari’ clip!
Austin: Come on! Come on!
Janine: Why would you make the underside of the car not flat?
Austin: [laughing] I don’t know!
Janine: [cross] If not for the fact that he’s fucking the car?
Sylvia: [cross] Nah, I love it.
Austin: Give that car a baby bump!
Sylvia: [cross] He’s making love to that car.
Art: [cross] That bump isn’t there unless… there’s got to be dick there, I think is the problem. [Austin and Keith laugh]
Janine: Ugh…
Art: He drew the dick and was, like… “I can’t send this in.”
Austin: [laughing, cross] “I’ve got to cover it up!”
Sylvia: Gary Larson: kind of a freak!
Austin: His editor was like “bro!”
Keith: I had a… got a gift at some point when I was, like… thirteen or something that was just a book…
Sylvia: [cross] Of this!? [laughter]
Keith: No, it was an anthology, a Far Side anthology.
Janine: [cross] The Far Side Gallery?
Keith: Uh… maybe, yeah. It was really long, and there was a whole section on controversial Far Side ones… [obscured by laughter]
Janine: I really want to get the hardcover collection that they put out, it’s really nice.
Keith: I wish I still had it, I don’t know what happened to it. Cos I read it so much when I was, like… fourteen, fifteen.
Jack: All the dog ones are really good.
Austin: These dogs are great.
Jack: [laughing] This one’s just…
Austin: [cross] There isn’t an easy way for me to get the… the…
Jack: [cross, laughing] This one’s just awful.
Austin: Oh boy… Whoa! [Ali and Keith laugh] Where’d that dog head come from?
Andrew: Aaaggh!
Jack: I don’t like that one.
Sylvia: [cross] I… I love that one.
Janine: [cross] Oh yeah, I remember that one [chuckles]. Ugh… fuck.
Sylvia: We don’t need to talk about it, but quick shout out to Heathcliff, cos that does tend to scratch the same stupid part of my brain.
Austin: [cross] Oh, Heathcliff’s been killing it. Are we… have we all been paying attention to the current Heathcliff series?
Jack: Oh yeah.
Sylvia: [cross] No…
Keith: [cross] Not the current one, but I…
Andrew: [cross] There’s a current one?
Austin: Well, the current…. There’s, like… an ongoing… this past… I guess it might be over now. But the past week of Heathcliffs have been about, like, cameos by green characters? [Ali laughs]
Sylvia: That’s great… that’s fantastic!
Ali: [cross] Let’s fucking go, yeah.
Austin: [cross] Here’s where to find it. Yeah, you can just go through these. Not the most recent one.
[00:30:00]
Austin: But the ones before that. It’s been… a green alien, the green M&M, Yoda…
Ali: Yoda!
Austin: Yoda’s in there. A bunch of green frog cartoon characters, which is another type of cartoon animal that we could do a whole bit on. The Jolly Green Giant, Oscar the Grouch has showed up. You know?
Ali: Can I just say…
Janine: [cross] I saw this Yoda one without context, and I was, like, OK… May the 4th, I guess? I don’t know…
Austin: No, it was not even that…
Janine: No, yeah…
Austin: It was just… cos May the 4th…
Keith: [cross] Oh, he’s little in that one.
Janine: [laughing, cross] All the frogs!
Ali: [cross] This is one of the single greatest comic frames I’ve ever seen, which is just this tiny little cat.
Austin: Yeah, this tiny cat. Heathcliff’s good. There was a May the 4th Star Wars, it was Chewbacca, an Ewok, Garfi… Ooh, Heathcliff; my bad, my bad, my bad… and a dog who I don’t know? I don’t know this dog… in a Living with Fleas panel.
[short pause]
Andrew: Oh, I don’t know who that dog is either.
Janine: That’s, uh… Yellow Pochoco.
Austin: Oh, Heathcliff’s fucking funny to me. [Jack and Ali laugh]
Keith: Heathcliff’s funny.
Ali: It’s so good.
[Austin and Andrew laugh]
Austin: This one of the two birds watching Heathcliff with the helmet?
Janine: [cross, laughing] That bothers me!
Austin: That bothers me! [Jack and Keith laugh]
Janine: Aren’t the helmet’s normally, like… there’s a thing, it’s like, ham helmet or whatever?
Keith: [cross] Yeah, it’s normally what the character that’s wearing it is thinking about.
Janine: Yeah…
Austin: [cross] Yeah… yeah, yeah. 
Janine: [cross] So the fact that it just says ‘helmet’ is…
Keith: [cross] So the helmet says he’s just walking down the street thinking about helmet.
Austin: Right, uh-huh? [Keith laughs]
Sylvia: [laughing] Fuck yeah…
Austin: This one…
Keith: Stupid…
Austin: Oh, it’s the same one twice, whoops! Whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops… here we go. Heathcliff thinking ‘cat’, robot thinking ‘robot’, worm thinking ‘worm’, birds… ‘even the worm’s got one’. [Keith and Jack laugh]
Andrew: Damn…
Austin: Oh bro… This one… this one cooks! [laughing] Heathcliff on the computer [Janine laughs], a mouse walking around with a ‘no fear’ helmet [Keith and Andrew laugh]. It says “you’re slipping.” [laughter] You fell off, Heathcliff!
Keith: The gulf between Garfield and Heathcliff is outrageous!
Sylvia: Oh, it’s the Marianas Trench.
Keith: It’s… yeah! [laughs].
Sylvia: Not to pit two bad bitches against each other, but you know…
Austin: Alright, we should…
Jack: They belong to the same genus, in Ali’s one? Is wild. [Ali and Janine laugh]
Austin: That’s wild.
Ali: Everytime there’s a Heathcliff comic that says ‘bro’ or ‘dude’... [Austin laughs]
Sylvia: [laughing] It’s so good!
Ali: I’m cracking up. I gotta tell you.
Austin: [cross] Bro! Dude! [Ali laughs] I need a bro-dude shirt.
Ali: Yeah…
Sylvia: Shout out Trash Ape.
Austin: Shout outs to Trash Ape. Sometimes you feel like a trash ape, you know what I’m saying?
Sylvia: [cross] Greater current Heathcliff character… I feel like Trash Ape… I feel like Trash Ape today? But I’m gonna do my best [Ali laughs].
Austin: Oh shit…
Ali: Is it time.is time?
Sylvia: I’m ready.
AUstin: [cross] I think so. Wait… What if I told you you could get a shirt from what is definitely a scam site. [Ali laughs] Umm…
Janine: Oh boy!
Keith: [cross] You can get a shirt from a scam site? 
Sylvia: [cross] I wouldn’t be shocked!
Austin: That has… but it has this on it.
Janine: [cross, sarcastically] It’s a new day!
Andrew: We both went to go look at shirts.
Austin: We did…
Andrew: Apparently.
Austin: [laughing] But this is the one where everybody in the nieghborhood has ‘bro’ shirts on!
Sylvia: [cross] I would… I would wear that. The thing is, I think I just want a bro shirt!
Austin: [cross] Yeah, a bro shirt is just kind of funny.
Sylvia: [cross] Like, I think at that point…
Janine: Yeah, that’s an easy one to make, you can just do that.
Sylvia: Yeah.
Keith: You can just make a yellow shirt that says ‘bro’.
Sylvia: I just need the right font, but once I got that. 
Austin: [cross] Sorry, what’s going on with this one? What’s going on with this Heathcliff shirt?
Janine: [cross] Whoa! [Ali and Andrew laugh]
Sylvia: OK?
Janine: Uhh…
Austin: Oh, it’s the brand’s name… the brand… it’s a Japanese apparel company called Bait.
Sylvia: Ohh…
Janine: OK!
Keith: I still… that doesn’t make me like it. [Austin laughs]
Ali: I want to draw everybody’s attention to the real reach of a time quote that we have today, by the way? 
Sylvia: Oh god.
Andrew: [cross] This is a great way to get me to go to time.is, thank you Ali.
Janine: [cross] Oh no…
Ali: “Someone’s sitting in the shade today, because somebody planted a tree a long time ago.”
Janine: [cross] Warren Buffett! Cool…
Art: [cross] That’s Warren Buffett… [Ali laughs]
Ali: It’s just included because it has the word ‘time’ in it? Come on, man!
Keith: Time… And the concept of a tree growing?
Austin: [cross] The concept of time… yeah.
Ali: [cross] Right.
Keith: This is kind of my joke about time.is quotes, which is just, like… a sentence that has the word time in it.
Ali: Hmm…
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: But they’re making it real.
Keith: They’re making it real.
Austin: They’re making it real.
Janine: Petition to put “It’s time to pay the price” into the time.is quote bucket.
Austin: Yeah!
Ali: Oooh!
Art: Oh yeah!
Austin: It’s time to pay the price.
Ali: I still think we should buy time.is and, uh… 
Austin: Oh, it’s done…
Andrew: We’ve got that money?
Austin: It’s too big, it’s now too far. Dan Ryckert had Adam Cole, the AEW wrestler, go to time.is three days ago. [Ali laughs]
Sylvia: Oh my god!
Austin: It’s… it escaped.
Keith: I just need to… 
[00:35:00]
Keith: I just…
Austin: [cross] I gave you credit! In that conversation, in that conversation!
Keith: [cross] Thank you… thank you.
Austin: Because Dan was, like… “I think Vinnie told me about that?” And Vinnie was, like… “No, I think Austin invented that…” And I was: “I absolutely did not!”
Janine: [laughing] Invented it!
Keith: [cross] Thank you…
Austin: “I did not! I learned that from RunButton!”
Keith: I invented going to time.is!
Austin: A hundred percent, that’s Keith and Kyle… 
Keith: I think Kyle invented going to time.is.
Austin: “That was not me…” We didn’t record that part of the conversation, that was before we did the podcast, but… I corrected them as quickly as I could, so…
Andrew: Can’t wait for ‘It’s time.is bay-bae!’ shirts. [laughter]
Sylvia: Oh my god…
Janine: Should I subscribe to the time.is newsletter?
Austin: [cross] No. Well. Someone should.
Sylvia: [cross] No! What are they going to tell you? That… it’s noon?
Janine: [cross] “Join the time.is mailing list to be the first to hear about new features on time.is. Your email address will not be shared with anyone…”
Austin: That’s a lie…
Janine: “And you can unsubscribe at any time.”
Andrew: Oh…
Austin: Do you have a burner account that you can send shit to? Just in case they start selling your stuff?
Andrew: I could, you want me to sign up for it with my Granblue email address?
Keith: [cross] I would like to maybe hear of some new features.
Austin: Oh yes! That’s kind of perfect actually. 
Janine: [cross] Yes, please do.
Sylvia: [cross] Oh god…
[Andrew laughs]
Andrew: Uh… wait… where do you go to sign up for this?
Janine: If you scroll to the bottom, there’s a thing that says ‘newsletter’, under ‘apps, widgets, timezone news’... and then ‘newsletter’.
Austin: They should let me read the old newsletters.
Art: All the latest time news.
Austin: I’m curious.
Art: Find out about upcoming times.
Keith: Today, 5-12-24. Time, still going.
Austin: Still at it.
Keith: They checked, it’s still happening today.
Austin: Yeah. [short pause] All right. Want me to do a clap?
Ali: Twenty?
Austin: Dre, have you signed up?
Art: [cross] Why was I thinking about… too much checking if time is still running?
Andrew: [cross] I have.
Austin: Yeah, I know… whoo… Twenty-five seconds.
Andrew: Shit! [short pause]
[several claps]
Andrew: It closes time.is when you sign up for the mailing list. Fuck!
[general chorus of “no” and laughter].
Keith: That was such a luxurious wait too!
Austin: It was, it really was.
Keith: Such a long time.
Austin: It was a real long time.
Andrew: I, like.. Panicked. I couldn’t figure out how to get back, cos I was, like… “wait, where’d the clock go?!” [laughs]
Austin: God…
Andrew: Ugh…
Austin: Fifty? Are you good, Dre?
Andrew: Yes.
Austin: OK, fifty. 
[short pause followed by several people clapping together]
Austin: Alright.
[music plays to end]
