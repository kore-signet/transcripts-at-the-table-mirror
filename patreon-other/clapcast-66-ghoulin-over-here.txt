Transcribed by Daneran#6021






JANINE: [cross] Why is this everywhere?


ART:  [cross] Yeah. They…


[DRE chuckles] 


ART: They wanted one in the ceremony.


AUSTIN: [cross] Ahhh!


ART: [cross] But we said no.


[KEITH laughs] 


JANINE: [cross] Uh-huhh…


AUSTIN: [cross] You didn’t want to take that money? 


ART: [cross] No.


AUSTIN: [cross] That could have been good money! 


ART: It was… Yeah. They were, like… [cross] 10 grand.


JANINE: [cross, unintelligible] [??? – 0:00:13]


KEITH: Well it… It was Netflix so there was no residuals.


AUSTIN: I see!


ART: [chuckles] Yeah. And it would have been the pictures forever. 


KEITH: Right.


AUSTIN: Right. [cross] Right, sure.


[DRE murmurs affirmatively] 


KEITH: [cross] Every time they rebroadcast Art’s wedding pictures…


[AUSTIN & ART laugh] 


KEITH: …you know, Netflix is getting a cut.


[JANINE laughs] 


AUSTIN: But Art isn’t. 


KEITH: Timothy Olyphant's probably getting a cut!


AUSTIN: Oh for sure!


KEITH: But Art's getting nothing.


ART: Yeah.


KEITH: [cross] And he…


DRE: [cross] I don't know, maybe Timmy Olyphant didn't get a cut, that's why he's got to do Justified 2.


AUSTIN: [cross] Is Justified 2 happening?


KEITH: [cross] Yeah. Nobody wants the beginning…


ART: Wait, is that real?


DRE: [cross] Yeah. Yeah.


ALI: [cross] Yeah.


ART: [cross] Didn’t they kill…


DRE: [cross] It is Justified: City Primeval…?


ALI [laughs] What?!?


KEITH: Sorry… I missed what you said… 


ART: What?!?


KEITH: …but from Justified: City Primeval it sounds like they're doing a horror Justified spin-off? That takes place in hell?


AUSTIN: That sounds great! They should do that!


ART: Wait! Can I… Can I…


[JANINE laughs] 


ART: Can I ask a question that relates to a Justified spoiler for a second?


DRE: [cross] Sure.


KEITH: [cross] I’ve never seen it, so that’s fine.


ALI: [cross] Uhm, how spoiler…? Okay, wait. I’m gonna…


AUSTIN: [cross] Wai-wai-wai-wait. Wai-wai-wai-wai-wai-wai-wait!


ART: [cross] This should be a literally a last episode spoiler.


AUSTIN: [cross] No. The answer is no.


ALI: [cross] I’m leaving the call.


ART: [cross] Okay.


ALI: [cross] I’ll be right back. [chuckles] 


ART: Oh no! I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!


ALI: [laughing] Okay! Everybody else could talk about Justified.


AUSTIN: No, no. [cross] It’s fine.


ALI: [cross] I'm fine to bail out.


JANINE: [cross] I don’t know what this even is. So… [cross]


AUSTIN: It’s a Timothy Olyphant show where he's… a cop who has to rub shoulders with… you know, criminals and… [cross] but also, kind of, you know…


DRE: [cross] God! Ar… Austin!


ART: It's a… It's a neo-noir gothic western.


ALI: [cross] Uh-huh.


AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah. That's right.


DRE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


DRE: Set in Appalachia, Kentucky.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Uh-huh.


ART: Yeah, I guess if something, Kentucky can be a western.


[ALI chuckles] 


AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah.


DRE: [cross] Yeah. It is.


AUSTIN: [cross] It is!


DRE: It absolutely is.


ART: Well, it's just not that far west.


DRE: The main antagonist…


KEITH: Yeah.


DRE: …he and… he and the cop grew up mining coal together, [cross] you see.


ALI: [cross] Yeah.


AUSTIN: [cross] Right. 


ART: [cross] Yeah.


ALI: [cross] And they have a little bit of a…


AUSTIN: [cross] Exactly. Yeah.


ART: [cross] Oh, I’m sorry.


ALI: [cross] …a little bit of a vibe.


ART: [cross] Neo-noir, gothic…


AUSTIN: [cross] They definitely have a vibe!


DRE: [cross] Ohhh, yeah…!


ART: [cross] … homoerotic western.


AUSTIN: [cross] Homoerotic western.


DRE [cross] Yeah! Uh-huh! [laughs]


[ALI laughs] 


AUSTIN: Yeah. Ye-ye-yeah.


DRE: It is so fucked up to me… That's the first thing I've ever seen Walter Goggins in and then after that I just saw, like, all the sitcoms and shit he's in. Where he's, like, the perfect nice guy man. And I… I can't.


AUSTIN: Oh, I can't imagine him like that at all. [cross] Is he… 


DRE: [cross] So…


ART: [cross] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! He did this show The Unicorn.


KEITH: Oh…


DRE: [cross] The Unicorn.


ART: [cross] Where he is, like, the very nicest man that's like: “don't you fall for it single women of Los Angeles! He's gonna kill you!”


AUSTIN: Does he still look like that?


JANINE: [cross] Ohhh!


ART: [cross] That's what he looks like.


KEITH: Yeah.


DRE: I mean, he's like nicer put together but he's still… I mean, he still looks like Walter Goggins.


KEITH: [cross] I’ve never…


ART: [cross] Yeah. He's combed his hair.


DRE: Yeah.


KEITH: I've never seen Walter Goggins in anything more than a guest spot. But I always got from him, like, slightly off-putting weirdo… [cross] was the vibe…


DRE: [cross] Yeah!


ART: [cross] I just…


KEITH: … than nice guy.


ART: I do want to put out while just we’re on the subject, I believe it's Walton Goggins. T-o-n.


DRE: Oh, you’re right. It is Walton.


KEITH: Walton. Yeah, it is.


ART: Uh. Yeah. But, you know, he was, like, full-on CBS sitcom dad. And, like, the plot was like: his wife died. And he has two kids. 


AUSTIN: [cross] Oohh…!


ART: [cross] And he's doing such a good job raising them. And his friends want him to date now. And it's like… it's not…


AUSTIN: [cross] Him?


ART: [cross] It’s not… [unintelligible??? – 0:03:03]


DRE: [cross] I think his kids want him to date now, too.


[KEITH laughs] 


AUSTIN: Wow.


ART: Yeah.


DRE: I'm just… I'm posting screencaps from the show in dogpound so you can…


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: [sneezes, cross] Excuse me.


JANINE: [cross] I'm just having the intrusive thought of what if his name was Walton Goggers.


[KEITH laughs]


JANINE: Instead of Walter.


ALI [cross] Sure…


AUSTIN: [cross] Right-right-right. I got you. If you swapped them. Yeah.


JANINE: Yeah. [chuckles] 


DRE: Uhum.


ART: This dog picture looks Photoshopped!


DRE: [cross] It does.


AUSTIN: [cross] It almost certainly is. Right?


ART: I guess! [chuckles]


ALI: [cross] Yeah. That's not his head.


KEITH: [cross] Well, he hates dogs.


AUSTIN: That’s not his head!


KEITH: Yeah.


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: That person was not facing this direction.


JANINE: Oh that's a… That's a bad… That's bad.


[pause] 


DRE: [cross] Wait…


AUSTIN: [cross] That might be a drawing!


JANINE: [cross] You could see the tap out of that shot… [??? – 0:03:37]


KEITH: [cross] This is…


DRE: [cross] Wait!


JANINE: [cross] It’s a weird tap sticking out there?


DRE: Walton Goggins is gonna be in the Fallout TV show.


AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah. Yes. As…


KEITH: [cross] Is that Rob Corddry behind him?


AUSTIN: [cross] As “Ghoul.”


ART: [cross] That is Rob Corddry. Yes.


AUSTIN: Right? 


DRE: [cross] Oh, I don't know.


AUSTIN: [cross] He's a Ghoul… He’s a ghoul named Ghoul. That's actually true.


ALI: What?


DRE: I feel like…


ART: [cross] I think they should name a ghoul “A Ghoul Named Ghoul.” [??? – 0:03:55]


DRE: [cross] I think one of the characters in the older Fallout movies… Or in the Fallout games — I feel like there was, like, a ghoul named Ghoul…


AUSTIN: [cross] I don’t… Let me tell you, I've watched…


DRE: [cross] … who joined your party or something.


AUSTIN: I watched those Range Touch folks play those games! That is not… I don't believe that that's true.


DRE: Okay.


AUSTIN: I don't believe that [cross] there’s a ghoul named Ghoul.


DRE: [cross] That just sounds like something that would be in Fallout, I guess! [chuckles]


AUSTIN: Yes! Yes. It's like a type of being. You know?


DRE: Uhum.


AUSTIN: Are we all… Is Jack here? No Jack yet.


ALI: [cross] And Sylvie. 


JANINE: [cross] I bet…


ART: [cross] There’s no Jack or Sylvie.


KEITH: [cross] Or Sylvie.


AUSTIN: Or Sylvie.


JANINE: I bet the Ghoul thing is that they want to do, like, a reveal — where it's like: it's not just a zombie. Because they're assuming…


AUSTIN: Hmm…!


JANINE: A lot of… They're assuming most people who watch a show won't have actually…


AUSTIN: Right. Right.


JANINE: … played Fallout. 


AUSTIN: [cross] Right.


JANINE: [cross] So they won't know that ghouls are, like, just people…?


AUSTIN: Uhum.


DRE: Uhum.


JANINE: So they're gonna… They're gonna do that reveal. You know?


AUSTIN: That’s… Yeah. That makes perfect sense to me.


[ALI sniffs] 


DRE: [in a raspy voice] Hey, I'm ghouling over here!


ALI: [cross] Yeah…


AUSTIN: [cross] That's what he says… That’s how he sounds. Just generally speaking. So…


KEITH: [mock-shouting] “They said ghoul! They said ghoul!”


AUSTIN: Yeah. [chuckles] That's the… Well, that's a Fallout fan. Yeah.


KEITH: Yeah. Ye-ye-yeah. That's the… They get the reference.


AUSTIN: They get the… Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. We're in on it over here.


[pause, someone clears their throat] 


ART: This interview about why they're doing a Justified revival is just these people, like, trying very hard not to say “the money was too good.”


DRE: [cross] Yeah.


AUSTIN: [cross] Right. Sure.


ART: There's all these interviews like: “we're really happy with what we did, we thought we'd close that chapter [mic cuts out briefly] … back!”


[AUSTIN chuckles ] 


KEITH: I… In my head it only ended a few years ago… but it ended in 2015.


ART: Well…


KEITH: I was gonna say like it's…


AUSTIN: [cross] That’s time!


DRE: [cross] That’s time…


KEITH: [cross] It's ridiculously too early to do a revival. 


AUSTIN: That’s time!


KEITH: Seven years still is early, but…


AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah.


KEITH: [cross] I guess it's not that early. I've never… I've never seen… I've only heard good things about it, but…


DRE: It's… I love that show. I'm definitely blinded by it being in Kentucky — but I'd love that show.


ALI: [cross] It’s fun!


ART: [cross] That show was really good!


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Ohh! This new one is not in Kentucky!


ART: [cross] No.


DRE: [cross] No. I think it's in Miami.


AUSTIN: No!


ART: It's in Detroit!


AUSTIN: It’s in Detroit!


DRE: Oh! Oh, you're right! Ye-ye-yeah.


AUSTIN: Detroit is the titular City Primeval.


ALI [mildly impressed] Wow!


KEITH: Uhm…


AUSTIN: [cross] The… 


ART: [cross] Detroit, or as they called it, the Kentucky of the North.


AUSTIN: Right. Yeah.


JANINE: [chuckling] I was gonna say the same thing.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh…


KEITH: They also call it the Miami of the North. Which is really confusing.


[AUSTIN laughs]


DRE: Sure, sure, sure.


[pause] 


JACK: Hello.


AUSTIN: [cross] Hello! 


ALI: [cross] Hi!


SYLVI: Hi, Jack!


ART: Hi!


AUSTIN: Hi.


JACK: Hello. Uhm. There's like a tiny little bit of noise on my microphone…


AUSTIN: It’s fine.


AUSTIN: But I don't think it's… the kind of thing that noise removal will have a problem removing.


ALI: Uhum.


AUSTIN: Sure. [cross] Also, you're going to be on this call for…


JACK: [cross] But I wanted to let you know, Ali.


AUSTIN: [cross] … not a long time.


JACK: [cross] Oh, yeah. But I don't want to be hissing, you know?


AUSTIN: Uhum.


JACK: While I'm here.


ALI: [softly] Yeah.


JACK: I don't want to spend my one wild and crazy life…


KEITH: Well…


AUSTIN: [cross] Not hissing?


JACK: [cross] … as Mary Oliver says, hissing.


[AUSTIN chuckles] 


JACK: The wild geese. What are you gonna do with your one wild life?


KEITH: [simultaneously] Hiss.


AUSTIN: [simultaneously] Hiss.


JACK: Yeah…


KEITH: Like geese do.


JACK: Like geese do, yeah. Yeah. One of my friends has geese on a farm and the goose's foot got sick…


DRE: [cross] Aaww…


[someone, very distorted] Aw, cute! [potentially Art??? – 0:06:53]


JACK: [cross] And it had to go in the human bath in the human bathroom. And the goose did not like this…


KEITH: [cross] Hmm…!


AUSTIN: [cross] Ohhh…


JACK: [cross] … other than the fact that it could lower its head into the ceramic of the bath and scream and hear an echo.


ALI [cross] Ohhh!


[KEITH & ART laugh] 


JACK: Which it did.


DRE: [cross] Hold on, let me add that to my character sheet. Hold on. [laughs] 


JACK: [cross] “Holy shit!”


AUSTIN: [cross] That’s great… That’s great goose energy. That’s impeccable goose energy.


[ALI laughs] 


JACK: “I don't want to be here but when I scream it echoes and this is fascinating to me.”


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: [cross] That is the world! [??? – 0:07:22]


DRE: [cross] Did they have an audio recording of that by chance?


[AUSTIN chuckles] 


JACK: They do. They do. But I think it's on their private twitter, unfortunately. [chuckles] 


[AUSTIN chuckles] 


DRE: Okay. Alright.


[pause]


JACK: [cross] … the goose [??? – 0:07:30]


SYLVI: [cross] Am I coming through okay?


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: [cross] Yeah, you sound great. [??? – 0:7:32]


AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah. [unintelligible] [??? – 0:07:33] 


SYLVI: [softly] Excellent.


DRE: Oh, Sylvie! You on that new laptop?


SYLVI: Yeah. I am. [cross] I'm on a different, like…


DRE: [cross] That huge fucking track pad?


SYLVI: Yeah.


JACK: It sounds great!


SYLVI: Thank you.


KEITH: What… What kind of laptops do you use?


ART: Scroll around something real quick for us!


[DRE laughs] 


SYLVI: What?


ART: On that big trackpad?


AUSTIN: This is a bad bit. [chuckles] Stupid…


SYLVI: [cross] Oh…


ART: [cross] Hey! Wow!


AUSTIN: What is this? What is this?


ART: We’re doing value judgements on bits now, is that what we’re doing?!?


[AUSTIN laughs] 


ART: [laughing] That’s what…


AUSTIN: [laughing] What is this?!?


DRE: Art, thank you for “yes, and”-ing my trackpad chat. [chuckles]


AUSTIN: You can “yes, and” and then put a period at the end of your sentence instead of a comma [chuckles] is all I'm saying! You can…


[ALI chuckles] 


AUSTIN: You can support the bit and then close it off and do a handoff to a new bit!


SYLVI: Sometimes “yes” is okay.


[AUSTIN & JACK laugh, ART chuckles]


KEITH: I thought that was funny.


AUSTIN: Ah… Yeah.


[ALI laughs] 


SYLVI: Me, too! I just [didn’t endure??? – 0:08:19] it properly.


AUSTIN: It's fine. Well, are you gonna scroll around [chuckles] something for us now or what?!?


[ART bursts out in laughter] 


SYLVI: I… I… I…


[AUSTIN & ALI chuckles]


SYLVI: I'm not gonna screenshare my walk Twitter account with you guys! [??? – 0:08:30] 


AUSTIN: Ah… Probably for the best! Um…! Time.is!


SYLVI: Definitely for the best!


[AUSTIN chuckles]


ART: Someone's running a backup, right? [cross] Because I'm of course not.


ALI: [cross] Uhum.


AUSTIN: [cross] I am… Yeah. I have a backup. Ali, are you also backing up?


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: [cross] Okay.


JANINE: [cross] What’s that tweet about, Keith?


KEITH: [cross] I’m also backing up!


ART: [cross] Because then I don’t need to… clap.


KEITH: We're lousy with backups.


ALI: Uhum.


JACK: Art has got a… a plastic cup attached to a string…


AUSTIN: Hmmm!


JACK: … that is running all the way from the desert north of the mountains to my house…


AUSTIN: [cross] Gotcha.


JACK: [cross] … and I'm holding the other cup up to my microphone.


DRE: Umm…


ART: [cross] Yeah, hold on…


KEITH: [cross] Camp 4! [??? – 0:08:57] will chew on that wire!


[0:09:01 – STINGER.]


JACK: I went to a candy store today which I have not done in years.


AUSTIN: Uhum.


JACK: And it was… It was one of those ones where, you know, they… You get a little scoop.


AUSTIN: [cross] Hm! Uhum. Uhum.


JACK: [cross] And you get to go around and choose the candy that you want. It was very pleasant. I came away with some Sour Peach candy…


[AUSTIN murmurs approvingly] 


JACK: [cross] And I came away with some peanut butter pretzel type things…


AUSTIN: [cross] Yum-yum-yum!


JACK: And a chocolate cookie dough type thing. It was really good! [cross, chuckles] But I left dollars… [??? – 0:09:26]


ART: [cross] The next time you're in New York, you go to Economy Candy.


[a slight pause] 


ART: [cross] Do it for me.


JACK: [cross] Economy Candy.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Where is this? 


JACK: Where is it?


AUSTIN: I don’t know this.


ART: Economy Candy is… [why does it sound like “cotton candy”??? – 09:35]


AUSTIN: Hmm! I see!


ART: … in the East Village, I guess?


AUSTIN: Uhum.


ART: East Village? Go south of Houston? Maybe it's like Nolita?


AUSTIN: I think that's… Yeah. Let's see. Let’s see where this is.


ART: Just a good old…


JACK: [cross] Oh, this looks great!


AUSTIN: [cross] Uhum.


ART: [cross] … New York candy nonsense place.


AUSTIN: Yeah. They're calling this… What are they calling this? They're not really calling it anything. It's east of Nolita. So it's, like… Because there's that long park, you know? [cross] It's on the other side of that…


JACK: [cross] Sarah D Roosevelt Park?


AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah, that one.


ART: [cross] And Nolita doesn't mean anything more. ‘Cause Little Italy is gone.


AUSTIN: It's gone.


ART: [cross] North of nothing now.


AUSTIN: [cross] Exactly. But! But my point being this would not be north of Little Italy even in the era of Little Italy.


ART: Uhum.


AUSTIN: It's too far over. It's over near, like… everything else. You know?


[a brief pause] 


JACK: [cross] There is a candy store…


AUSTIN: [cross] And it’s… the Lower East Side, right? It's just, like, the northwest of the Lower East Side?


ART: I guess.


AUSTIN: I guess it's… But it's…  Hmm… It's just above Delancey. I don't know. Anyway.


ART: Is it still the Bowery? I mean, Bowery is a few blocks over. [cross] But, like, this Bowery… 


AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah. I would call it the Bowery, maybe. 


[pause] 


AUSTIN: Anyway. [sighs]


ART: Let's try to buy an apartment in this neighborhood…


AUSTIN: Yeah!


ART: … and see what they say.


AUSTIN: Uhum. I'm checking! [cross] I’m figuring it out! 


ART: [cross] The Lower East Side is probably just right. It's…


AUSTIN: Uh. This is saying it is Bowery! Like, just barely.


ART: Hm…


AUSTIN: Oh, no! I'm wrong! I'm wrong. It's a block away! It is a block away. Like you said. It just doesn't count! Uhm…


ART: I would just like to say the idea of advertising a house as being in [cross] “the Bowery” is so funny.


AUSTIN: [cross] I know. It’s so funny. The way the world has changed.


[ART chuckles]


AUSTIN: Yeah. I think… [cross] I think Lower East Side is…


ART: [cross] Saying you have an apartment in Murderville.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh!


ART: But Murderville's been gentrified. Yeah, you can't… [chuckles, cross] You can't get a place in Murderville these days!


ART: [chuckling, cross] You can’t… You can’t afford Murderville anymore!


AUSTIN: [exaggeratingly] You can’t afford Murderville? Huh…! [chuckles] I’m complimented!


JACK: Getting priced out of Murderville. 


AUSTIN: Uh-huh!


ART: Ohh! “Priced out of Murderville”! That's… [cross] Who… Yeah.


JACK: [cross] God, “Priced out of Murderville”…


AUSTIN: [cross] “Priced out of Murderville”...! Yeah. That's great. That's… Is that, like, a feature story in a magazine? Is that like…


ART: [cross] Uhm…


JACK: [cross] Is it a…


AUSTIN: [cross] … a Batman Animated Series episode title?


ART: [cross] Yeah. It's a Batman Animated [chuckles] Series… It’s a… Yeah. It's a hard-boiled detective…


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: … Batman story.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: It's a song mentioned in another Mountain Goats song.


AUSTIN: Yeah! Uh-huh!


ART: Although, I guess if it's in Batman it's got to be “Priced out of Crime Alley.”


AUSTIN: Right. Right-right-right.


ART: [cross] So good, these…


JACK: [cross] I bet Batman's got a Murderville!


ART: Yeah. Batman has a Murderville.


[a brief pause] 


JACK: Is there a lot of murders happening in Gotham, nowadays? I feel like… I don't know. Is murdering the thing that happens the most in Gotham vis-a-vis crime?


ART: [cross] No.


AUSTIN: [cross] Nooo…


JACK: [cross] It is just mugging, I think.


AUSTIN: [cross] Robberies, right?


ART: [cross] I think it's, like, elaborate bank robberies. Yeah. [chuckles] 


AUSTIN: [chuckles] Yeah.


JACK: [chuckles] People robbing banks left and right?


AUSTIN: Uhum, uhum, uhum.


JACK: [cross, chuckling] I played the Arkham games!


ART: [cross] Do you know what the insurance in a bank in Gotham?


JACK: [chuckles] It's the worst!


AUSTIN: Uhhh… Alright. Uhm… Ready to clap?


ART: Yeah. 


JACK: Yep. 


AUSTIN: Uh… Five after? Five seconds after?


ART: [cross, faintly] Sure.


JACK: [cross] Okay.


[long pause, then clapping]


[0:12:33 – STINGER] 


AUSTIN: Are you all ready to rip?


SYLVI: [half-chuckling] Yeah. But really quick: Tom Brady just unretired.


AUSTIN: [cross] Are you fucking kidding me?


ART: [cross] What?


AUSTIN: [cross] Shut up!


SYLVI: [cross, wheeze-chuckles] He's coming back for another season in Tampa…!


AUSTIN: I hate this motherfucker. I hate it.


SYLVI: [cross] Yeah. I'm sorry. 


ART: [cross] In Tampa?!?


SYLVI: Yeah.


ART It's not even a scam to change teams?!?


SYLVI: No, it's Tampa. He's… “unfinished business.” “Let's fucking go,” as he says in the Tweet. Or he says “LFG” because I don't think he can swear without losing, like, half of his endorsements.


ART: [cross] Unfinished what?!?


AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah. He said “looking for a group.” He said “looking for group,” actually. [chuckles]


SYLVI: [cross] Is that “looking for a group” because he needs better teammates? I don't know.


[AUSTIN laughs] 


SYLVI: I don't watch football.


AUSTIN: That’s what that means. Yeah. Uh-huh.


ART: What could he consider unfinished?!? Motherfucker’s done everything and played for 20 years! I've…


[pause] 


SYLVI: “Unfinished business”!


ART: I don't like him… is the thing.


[a brief pause] 


AUSTIN: You're not allowed to do your version of the fucking… Michael Jordan Bulls documentary… [cross] and then…


SYLVI: [cross] After two months!


AUSTIN: … and then unretire.


SYLVI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: If you're gonna make… If you're gonna make them make that show for you you have to be done.


SYLVI: Oh, wow! Yeah.


SYLVI: I didn't know that he did that!


AUSTIN: Yeah. He did his version of the… What was that called? What was the name of that…


SYLVI: [cross] The Last Dance?


ART: [cross] The Last Dance?


AUSTIN: The Last Dance. Yeah. He did his version of The Last Dance last year.


ART: He did?!? When?!?


AUSTIN: Uhh… It's… called…


ART: He's been retired for, like, one second!


AUSTIN: It’s called Man in the Arena. [chuckles]


SYLVI: Right! [cross] The fucking ESPN thing!


AUSTIN: [cross] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.


ART: [cross] A terrible name.


AUSTIN: Which is of course a quote from Roosevelt.


SYLVI: Isn't that also Troy Baker's podcast? [chuckles]


AUSTIN: [chuckles] That's what he… I think that's what… No. 


SYLVI: [cross] Okay!


AUSTIN: [cross] He quoted that Roosevelt quote when he was mad at people canceling him for NFTs.


SYLVI: Right. Okay. Sorry.


AUSTIN: [cross] Quote… 


SYLVI: [cross] I thought… I thought that that was his podcast or something…?


AUSTIN: [cross] I mean… That’d be very funny. [with pathos] “The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, [...]”


[SYLVI laughs] 


AUSTIN: “... because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms [...]” Etc, etc, etc.


SYLVI: Ah, miserable.


ART: [cross] Okay, but this…


AUSTIN: [cross] “It's not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles [...]” etc.


ART: [half as a question] This documentary aired before he retired.


AUSTIN: Right! But it was… [cross] He was retiring.


SYLVI: [cross] It was, like, concurrent with his last season. 


AUSTIN: [cross] He shouldn't have done it then! He shouldn't have done it then, is the thing.


[pause] 


SYLVI: [cross] Shouldn’t have done it, period.


ART: [cross] I mean, the NFL is a swingy and random game…


AUSTIN: Yes!


ART: … but, like, that team's not gonna be better [cross] next year than it was this year when they didn’t win… But like…


AUSTIN: [cross] No, no! But they didn’t win! No…


ART: But like… the randomness of the football is such that they could just happen to win, right?


AUSTIN: Yeah. They could. I hate it


ART: I don't know if you all have heard of or seen the — it’s hard, because because I don't know what this is really on — but the the television program Kevin Can F**k Himself?[1] 


SYLVI: Oh! I listened to the podcast that one of the writers was on. But I haven't actually watched it. [laughs]


ART: Um. It’s a fascinating show [cross] that I'm halfway through.


SYLVI: [cross] I heard it’s alright!


ART: Because it's mentally taxing to watch…


SYLVI: [cross] It’s…


ART: [cross] … but there's a lot of Tom Brady worship in that show…


[SYLVI chuckles]


AUSTIN: [cross] Ahh! I see.


ART: [cross] And it’s exhausting, even on that level


AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah. I couldn't do it.


SYLVI: That stars the actress from Schitt's Creek, right? The sister…?


AUSTIN: Yes. [cross] Annie Murphy.


ART: [cross] The non-Catherine O'Hara…


SYLVI: Yeah. I'm glad she's doing more stuff. I like her.


[AUSTIN giggles] 


ART: It’s… it's weird because it's showing that she has a… she either is great at reading scripts or has a great agent because this is, like, a fantastic thing to go into right from that? It's another just like: this is a very clever show that shows how clever I am. And…


SYLVI: Yeah. 


ART: And that's great! You wanna… You don't want to just be making crap.


SYLVI: That's the… Can we change the “fun interaction between good friends” to [half-chuckling] “this is a clever show that shows how clever I am”?


[ART chuckles] 


AUSTIN: I mean… I… Again, people already think that that's what we mean when we say that. So…


SYLVI: Jesus.


AUSTIN: [vocalizes irritation] Ehhh… It's fine.


[long pause] 


AUSTIN: Also great stu… The guy from Force Awak… or Force Unleashed.


[pause] 


SYLVI: God…


AUSTIN: [cross] That’s it.


SYLVI: [cross] Didn't they port that to Switch recently?


AUSTIN: They're doing it.


SYLVI: [cross] Good for them. 


AUSTIN: [cross] It's this month, I wanna say. Yeah. 


SYLVI: [cross] Good for them.


ART: But isn't it not canon anymore?


AUSTIN: Nah, it's not. But what is, you know?


SYLVI: I mean, it never was, right? [cross] Like, you can kill Darth Vader in it…


AUSTIN: [cross] Well… Yeah. Yeah. Fair.


ART: [cross] I think that ending's not cannon. [chuckles] But I think the… the ones where he doesn't die are canon.


[a slight pause] 


AUSTIN: [sighs] It's all fake. It's all fake!


SYLVI: It's all fake.


AUSTIN: Alright.


ART: No. Some of it's real.


AUSTIN: Hmm! Pretty sure it's all fake!


ART: Some of the Star Wars are real.


[AUSTIN laughs] 


ALI: Hm…


AUSTIN: Oh! I see. That's why there's multiple: so you can… we can tell the story of the ones that are real.


ART: Yeah. What is fiction but of lens to view real Star Wars?


[SYLVI snickers] 


AUSTIN: Right! I gotcha.


SYLVI: It says “a long time ago in a galaxy far away”! They’re historical fiction!


AUSTIN: [cross] It’s true. [??? – 0:17:41] 


ART: [cross] They’re basically… 


[a brief pause] 


ART: They're basically Pride and Prejudice.


AUSTIN: Basically. It's basically the same. Alright.


ART: I guess that's not historical fiction. That was just…


AUSTIN: [cross] Ehh! That’s historical f…


ART: [cross] … basically written in history.


AUSTIN: I guess so. Uhm…! I think it's a little bit before her time, right? I think she sets it, like, a generation prior or whatever, doesn't she?


ART: Yeah. And that's when the Star Wars happened…


AUSTIN: [chuckles] Right!


ART: In the…


AUSTIN: [cross] In the Regency.


ART: [cross] In the 1920s.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Uh-huh. It's not the 1920s, Art. I know, I appreciate it, I… Jane Austen died in the 1810s. [chuckles]


[SYLVI laughs] 


ART: No, I was probably one… I was going one generation before George Lucas.


AUSTIN: Oh! I see, I see, I see, I see. [cross] Yes. Yes. Yes.


ART: [cross] As if George Lucas were telling a story…


ALI: Hm…


AUSTIN: Yeah. Uh-huh.


[0:18:21 – STINGER]


DRE: Just thinking ‘bout computers — how cool they are!


KEITH: I'm always doing that.


[some plastic packaging crinkling in the background] 


KEITH: I still want to get… I still want to get rid of my smartphone. I feel like that's such a bad idea.


DRE: Like… Like, for good?


KEITH: Ohh, I don't know if for good. But I just want to, like… I want to have two devices! I want to have a device that I am reachable on; and then another thing that I can either not… have or not have.


DRE: [cross] Oh, yeah. That's a…


SYLVI: [cross] You want a BlackBerry!


DRE: Ohh!


KEITH: I…


[SYLVI chuckles] 


KEITH: [cross] I want, like, a… 


DRE: [cross, exaggeratedly] Do you want a BlackBerry?


KEITH: I don't want a Blackberry because I've never been able to type on a Blackberry. Anything with a physical keyboard… I remember when iPhones and iPods… Like, iPod Touch’s first came out and people were like: “how is it gonna be to touch on a touch screen where there's no physical keyboards?!?” And I'm like: “those physical keyboards don't work! What are you worried about?” Uh…


[SYLVI laughs] 


KEITH: And I was right in a long… in the long run.


[JANINE chuckles tiredly] 


KEITH: I was right. Because it's way better to type on an iPhone than it ever was [cross] on a BlackBerry.


JANINE: [cross] What if you got, like, an old Sidekick off of eBay?


ALI: Yeah! 


KEITH: I'm…


DRE: Ooff… [cross] Yeah…!


SYLVI: [cross] Wow…!


KEITH: [cross] I'm thinking of getting an Android-based music player?


JANINE: Okay.


SYLVI: [cross] Oh, sort of a Zune situation?


DRE: [cross] So a Zune, yeah!


KEITH: [cross] Basically is, like, a newfangled iPod Touch… is really what it is.


SYLVI: Okay! Which I believe was also the pitch for the Zune.


KEITH: Yes. Yeah. It's a new…


[SYLVI chuckles] 


KEITH: Yeah.


DRE: Uhum.


KEITH: People still swear by the Zune 2! 


SYLVI: Oh, I knew a Zune kid in high school! [cross] We’ve set stuff on fi…


DRE: [cross] Is that way of saying that you were a Zune kid in high school? [laughs] 


SYLVI: [half-chuckling] No, I was not a zoom kid in high school! The Zune kid was my friend Jake who I set things on fire with in his driveway!


KEITH: Yeah.


DRE: Oh, hell yeah!


KEITH: Zune kids love fire!


AUSTIN: That's… That’s the one…!


DRE: That sounds like some real Zune kid behavior.


AUSTIN: Uhum. 


SYLVI: Mostly water bottles. But, you know… 


DRE: That… Hm…


SYLVI: Now, listen: I have… My lungs are… [cutting the topic short] It's fine.


AUSTIN: It's fine!


KEITH: Yeah. [is this KEITH or DRE??? – 0:20:43]


[KEITH laughs, JANINE vocalizes discomfort] 


AUSTIN: [cross] It’s good! It was good for you.


DRE: [cross] It’s fine.


KEITH: How's your cough?


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: Ehh…


[others laugh]


DRE: “Hey, unrelated question…” [laughs] 


SYLVI: [laughing] Lingering!


AUSTIN: Alright.


SYLVI: Okay.


AUSTIN: Time.is.


ALI: Time…


JANINE: Oh, should I stop and start a recording? [cross] Are we good on this one?


AUSTIN: [cross] Nah.


DRE: [cross] No.


AUSTIN: [cross] I wanna roll through…


JANINE: Okay. Okay.


SYLVI: I think it's just because Keith…


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah.


JANINE: Yeah…


AUSTIN: Also, end of break, so it kind of works with both.


DRE: Uhum!


AUSTIN: Alright! We ready?


KEITH: [cross] Yeah.


ALI [cross] Uhum!


[someone, yawning] Uhum! [??? – 0:21:15]


AUSTIN: Let's do 40 seconds. 40.


[pause, then disparate claps]


KEITH: Beautiful clap!
