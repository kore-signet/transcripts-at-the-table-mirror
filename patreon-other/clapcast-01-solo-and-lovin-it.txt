ALI: What’s the- time.is, okay.


AUSTIN: Mmhm, that’s the one.


ALI (over Austin): We’re goin’.


JACK: Okay. I’m...


JANINE: When are-


AUSTIN: Sorry, I’m... eating.


ALI: (laughs over Austin)


JANINE: Okay, I thought I’d missed the number. 


AUSTIN: (indistinct murmur)


AUSTIN: Nope! Okay. (pause) Let’s do, can we do at the top of the minute? 


JACK: Sure.


ALI: Sure. 


JANINE: Yeah. 


(unison group clap)


AUSTIN: That was good. (satisfied tone)


ALI: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Okay… Right, okay, and then let me look at Signet’s really quick.. Let’s take a, let’s take a quick break actually and then we’ll come back-


ALI: Sure. 


AUSTIN: That way I can get all my notes straight.


ALI: Yeah, yeah. 


JACK: Sounds good. 


JANINE: O-kay. 


AUSTIN: Also, also so I can open up these fruit snacks, and eat a couple. (crinkling of fruit snack package)


ALI, JACK, and JANINE: (laughs)


AUSTIN: Very important. (more crinkling) 


JANINE: I’ll be right back. 


AUSTIN: Mhm. (still crinkling, for about 5 seconds)


ALI:HO-oh. (content sigh)


AUSTIN: I’m excited to play.


ALI: Yeah! (pause) What kind of fruit snacks are those?


AUSTIN: They’re berry, Welch’s fruit snacks.


ALI: You saw that tomorrow’s Bloomin’ Monday, right?


AUSTIN: I saw. I really wanna go. 


ALI: I.. am so excited to go. 


AUSTIN, chewing: Mmhm. Jack, come to Bloomin’ Monday. 


ALI: Yeah! (pause) Janine, if you leave on the bus... By the time we’re done recording-


AUSTIN: (chuckles)


ALI: You’ll arrive to New York City-


AUSTIN (over ALI): I think Janine said she would be right back.


ALI: Okay, well she’s on that bus, to New York City.


AUSTIN: (single laugh)


(silence, crinkling)


AUSTIN: You guys see the orb?


ALI: (concerned exhale)


AUSTIN: That orb is- wild. 


ALI: I... don’t wanna talk about it. (single laugh) I saw it. (laugh) What- what’s the point of the orb?


AUSTIN: I don’t know, I wanna know the point of the orb is, really bad.


ALI (over the end of AUSTIN’s sentence): Is this a thing that happens?


AUSTIN: I don’t know.


ALI: I feel like I would’ve seen the orb before if it was a thing that happens, but maybe not. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, I- Yeah, I dunno. I can go to Google and type in “what’s up with the orb”, but...


ALI: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: I have doubts.


ALI: Yeah, I- there’s some things I just don’t need to know. 


(pause)


JACK: I found out that birds have four lungs, yesterday. 


ALI: Fo-ur…


AUSTIN, restating quietly: Four.


JANINE: Huh. 


JACK: Most birds have four lungs, and two voiceboxes?


AUSTIN: Huh. 


JACK: Which is how they can sing in polyphony, which I had never really worked out before. 


AUSTIN (over the end of JACK’s sentence): Oh, that’s interesting. 


JACK: And the reason that they have four lungs, is that it lets them breathe in and out simultaneously? Like, one-


AUSTIN: Interesting.


JANINE: Oo-ooh.


JACK: One maneuver-


JANINE: That’s.. weird. 


JACK: -is both an inhale and an exhale. Which I think if you’re gonna fly, is pretty..


ALI: Yeah, that seems handy.


AUSTIN: That makes a lot of sense. In terms of-


JANINE: We hear a lot about, like, people growing fish gills and shit, but what about bird lungs? Why isn’t that a thing?


JACK: Yeah.


ALI: Oo-ooh. 


AUSTIN: That’s a good one.


JACK: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: I’ll write that down right now. 


ALI: (laughs)


JANINE: Bird lungs. 


JACK: (laughs)


JANINE, laughing: You write that down in a doc and then lose it for three months and then come back to it like, “what the fuck is this?”


AUSTIN, incredulous, crossing with JACK: What is “bird lungs”?


JACK, crossing with AUSTIN: It says “bird lungs”. (laughs)


AUSTIN: I’ve written it down right here, underneath this faction. And now someone in that faction’s gonna have bird lungs. 


ALI: (chuckle)


AUSTIN: That’s how it works.


~Next segment~


AUSTIN: Can I- oop. I’m not getting my own.. Oh wait, yes I am. Can y’all talk a little bit?


ART: Sure, yeah, this is where I’m at? My OBS on my Audacity router needs a higher microphone.


AUSTIN (crossing with JANINE): I think your Discord does, too. 


JANINE (crossing with AUSTIN): Oh, that’s a good… good point.


ART: What if I..?


AUSTIN: That’s good.


ART: Oh, this is much better looking. 


AUSTIN, crossing JANINE: Yeah, look at that, that sounds great. That’s a- 


JANINE, crossing AUSTIN: Oh, yeah. Now you’re in sound town. 


AUSTIN: That’s a good sound. 


ART: Ah, sound town. 


JANINE: (laugh exhale)


AUSTIN: That’s what they call us. (pause) Is it? Is that what they call..?


JANINE: I don’t think they call us a town. 


AUSTIN: Mm. You sure?


ART: The Friends from Sound Town. 


AUSTIN: (amused exhale) 


ART: They have a table. 


AUSTIN: That’s- (laugh) That’s what they say.


~Next segment~


JACK: I’m not ill, but I can’t hear out of one of my ears. 


AUSTIN: Uh, Jack? I have a thing to tell you that’s gonna be.. Are you sitting down. 


SYLVIA, DRE, ALI, JACK: (chuckling in background)


AUSTIN: My friend, I suspect you are ill.


DRE: (chuckling)


ALI: Yeah, that’s what I told him. 


JACK: Uuh. 


JANINE: Yeah. 


JACK, resignedly: Yeah..


JACK (crossing with AUSTIN): I went to the doctor’s and he said-


AUSTIN (crossing with JACK): Is this worse than a cold, is this like a different thing?


JACK: No, I- Like my ear is legit fucked up. 


AUSTIN: Oh. 


JACK: Like, doctor proven. My ear has gone rogue. 


ALI: (sympathetic aaw)


JACK: So I went to the doctor and he was like “do this thing”, and I’m doing it and it’s getting better. Who knew? Like-


AUSTIN: What a cool trick!


JANINE: (laughing)


JACK: Medicine is working!


ALI: (laughing)


KEITH: Wait, could you never hear? 


AUSTIN: (laughing in background)


JACK: No, no, I can super hear. I-


ALI, DRE: (laughing)


KEITH: Oh, okay so something’s changed. You didn’t go like, “Hey doctor, what’s goin’ on?” And he’s like, “Oh, well, what’s ailing you?” “Oh I can’t hear, like all of us. Always.”


ALI: (laughing)


JACK: There’s just this button in Logic called “stereo” that I keep turning on and off. 


AUSTIN: Oh, no. 


JACK: Ah, no I’ll be fine, I think I’ll be fine. It should be done any time I need to do like, mixing? Which would be good?


AUSTIN: That would be good.


ALI: Mmhm.


JACK: Yup.


AUSTIN: I almost suggested, I literally just now almost said like “well, what you could do is you could just switch which headphone thing you’re listening out of.” And that’s not how sound works. That wouldn’t work-


ALI: Uh-uh.


AUSTIN: -at all. 


ALI: No.


JANINE: Yeah, I was gonna say “Have you tried a Neti-pot?” and then I remembered that’s for your nose, so.


AUSTIN: That’s a nose thing. 


ALI: Oh, my god. Okay, let’s start.


AUSTIN: Okay. 


JANINE: (laughs)


KEITH: You don’t wanna talk about Neti pots?


JACK, over KEITH: I’m going to start another recording. 


KEITH, crossing with AUSTIN and ALI: You don’t want to talk about the watering cans that you squirt up your nose and come out the other side?


AUSTIN, crossing with KEITH and ALI: Can we clap? Let’s clap?


ALI, crossing with KEITH and AUSTIN: So, 45?


AUSTIN: Forty-five seconds. 


ART: Forty-five.


AUSTIN, crossing with JACK: You know what? 40 seconds, I can’t deal with fifteen more seconds of this.


JACK, crossing with AUSTIN: We should never all be on the call at the same time. 


JANINE: (chuckles)


AUSTIN: This is a mistake. 


ALI: Everyone, stop talking. 


AUSTIN: Good show, everybody. 


(ragged group clap)


ALI: (exasperated snort)


AUSTIN: (sigh)


KEITH: Wait, I-


ALI: No-


KEITH: -missed the part where we were switching to 40. 


DRE: (laughing in background)


AUSTIN: Oh...


ALI: (laughs)


AUSTIN: Fuck. Okay.


KEITH: I was making sure my recording was good, so.


AUSTIN: Thirty-one minutes?


ART: No, we can’t do the minute. 


AUSTIN: I thought we- we’d gotten over it. 


JANINE: We can try.


AUSTIN: Let’s try the minute!


ART: All right. 


(slightly more synchronized clap)


ALI, crossing with KEITH: That was really bad.


KEITH (high-pitched, crossing with ALI): That sounded okay. 


KEITH, high-pitched: No, it sounded fine. It was fi-ine.


ALI: (disagreeing squeak)


AUSTIN: Let’s do one more at 20. 


ALI, JANINE: (laughing)


JACK: We’re going to ask people for money.  


ART: Well we’re not going to do it with this, this isn’t going to be on there. 


SYLVIA: When are we clapping?


AUSTIN: Twenty. 


JANINE: Twenty. 


JACK: Twenty. 


SYLVIA: Oh shit-


(group clap)


ALI: (cackles)


AUSTIN: Did we miss? Cause that was really good!


KEITH: That was like the wave for me. 


JANINE: I felt like I was too early. 


SYLVIA: I got it!


AUSTIN: We got three, one of those was pretty much right, I’m sure. I have the OBS, I can send you the OBS-


ALI: Yeah, it’ll be fine. 


JANINE: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: You’re doing an OBS, Ali?


ALI: I also have an OBS.


SYLVIA: (laughing)


AUSTIN: We got double- we got triple- 


KEITH: I have two of em. I have an OBS and an X-split, so. 


AUSTIN: All right. Great. Okay, let me take some water before I do an intro. 


SYLVIA: (laughing)


KEITH: Oh, water would be good.


AUSTIN: (sighs)


JACK: I have so many snacks. 


AUSTIN: Okay… (pause)


ALI (whispering): I have no snacks.


AUSTIN: For eons- that’s wrong, lemme start over. 


ALI, SYLVIA: (laughing)


~Next segment~


AUSTIN: I’m gonna listen to this audio. Actually Janine, can you give me a little more?


JANINE: Yeah... I’m sitting in my room and my door is open a crack so that if Annie gets interested in what’s happening in here, she won’t stand outside meowing for like ten minutes-


AUSTIN (crossing JANINE): I hope she comes inside meowing, instead.


JANINE (crossing AUSTIN): -getting increasingly hoarse, in the process.


AUSTIN: Aaw. 


JANINE: Yeah, we’ll see.


AUSTIN: Aaw. All right, I’m gonna listen to this.


JANINE: She gets really hoarse in the morning, because she spends- She does, like... She has certain times that she expects me to be out of my room, so she’ll like come up and meow for like five minutes and then go away again. But then when I’m in the shower she just meows the whole time. (pause) Austin left. In my cat story. 


AUSTIN: Uh-oh.


JANINE: (chuckle)


AUSTIN: All right, I’m back. 


JANINE: Welcome back. 


AUSTIN: Art, can you talk little bit more?


ART: Sure, yeah, hi. I do not have any problems with pet hoarseness.


AUSTIN: There we go, I think we’re good. 


ART: All right.


JANINE: That’s cause you have a dog.


ART: Yeah. (pause) She does this really great noise I’m struggling to like describe, it’s like when she growls with her whole mouth? She’s like “rarrarar”, she growls while moving her jaw back and forth?


JANINE: She does an Austin impression?


ART: Yeah, kinda. 


AUSTIN: That was me, that’s me. Okay, let’s time.is and clap. 


ART: All right. (pause) Ooh, international kissing day. 


AUSTIN: Is that today?


ART: That’s what time.is says. 


AUSTIN: Mm. Don’t (laughing) don’t tell our chat.


ART: No.


AUSTIN: Let’s clap at…? Twenty seconds?


ART: Twenty? All right. 


(group clap)


AUSTIN: O-kay.


~Next segment~


AUSTIN: All right, let’s do… Let’s do 35? 


ART and DRE simultaneously: Sure.


KEITH:  Yeah.


(single clap)


AUSTIN: That was-


KEITH: That was thirty. 


SYLVIA: Oh. I’m- my time.is got disconnected. 


DRE, KEITH: (laughing)


(two claps)


SYLVIA: What the fuck. 


KEITH, laughing: Hold on, okay, no, now we need to do a new number. 


SYLVIA: Now we need to do a Clapcast, cause fuckin’ hell.


AUSTIN: (sigh) Jesus. 


KEITH: (laughing)


SYLVIA; Yeah, I’d never seen that before. (crossing with KEITH) “Your server is disconnected”. 


KEITH (crossing with SYLVIA): I’ll say this though- 


SYLVIA: I’m good now. 


KEITH: -if we were clapping at thirty, that would have been perfect. 


AUSTIN, SYLVIA (unison): Yeah!


SYLVIA: Yeah, I’m.. Fuckin’ great. 


AUSTIN: Let’s do this at 46 minutes? 


KEITH: Okay.


SYLVIA: Sorry.


ART: I didn’t clap at all, so it wouldn’t’ve been perfect. 


AUSTIN, exasperated: Okay. 


(group clap)


AUSTIN: Good clap.


KEITH: That was a pretty good clap.


AUSTIN: Pretty good clap. 


(pause)


AUSTIN: Let’s take like a five minute break? And then we’ll get into play. 


ART: All right, I have to go convince my wife not to be mad at our dog. 


DRE: (chuckles)


AUSTIN: Oh no. 


DRE: Oh no!


KEITH: What’s wrong with, why is your dog... being a jerk?


DRE: But Mabel’s perfect, and wonderful.


ART: It’s very hot outside? That’s a thing that’s happening in LA right now, it’s like 100 degrees-


KEITH: (listening hum)


ART: -and apparently she took her out, just to see if she had to pee and poop. And she like pulled her all the way to her poop spot, which is like across the street, and then just like got there and didn’t do anything? And she came in all hot and mad. 


KEITH: (laughs) 


ART: Be right back. 


KEITH: This dog lied to me!


ART: Yeah. 


(pause, KEITH chuckling)


KEITH: I just saw an Onion article headline that like, happened to me three times in the last couple weeks. “Late-Arriving Guest Encouraged To Load Up On Food Sitting in Sun for Past Four Hours.”


AUSTIN: Eugh.


DRE: (snort)


KEITH: I went to two Fourth of July-y type things, that like- I was at other stuff first and then left to go to those parties?


AUSTIN: Sure, like you do.


KEITH: And they were like “Have some food! We were just about to put it away, have some food!” And it’s like-


AUSTIN (overlapping KEITH): I lost Keith. Keith?


KEITH (overlapping AUSTIN): -you guys were out here for like, all day. 


AUSTIN (overlapping KEITH): Or did I lose me? (pause) Dre?


KEITH (overlapping AUSTIN): I don’t want, like, your five-hour-old burger. 


AUSTIN: I lost me, okay. 


ART: I was just thinking that everything I come in at the end of is like an ad read, and that was our like...


DRE: (chuckling)


AUSTIN: Can anybody hear me?


SYLVIA: Well we were talking about fuckin’ razors so much, I thought we finally got that Harry’s endorsement, you know?


KEITH: (laughs)


ART: Red Robin: Our burgers haven’t been out for five hours, or something.


SYLVIA: (snorts)


KEITH: The picture’s so gross too, it’s like potato salad, brown guacamole, and then like an almost-empty tray of vegetables and crackers. Art, have you seen Bajillion Dollar Properties?


ART: I haven’t. Which is weird, because I like a lot of those people and I watch HGTV like, literally all the time. 


KEITH: It’s- okay, the first season is not... great. 


ART: All right, I’ve already skipped it. 


DRE: Is it literally called “Bajillion Dollar”?


KEITH: Yes, it’s a comedy satire.. It’s a comedy show making fun of like HGTV reality, like real estate shows?


DRE: Oh (elongated), okay. 


ART: There’s definitely a show called Million Dollar Properties which is its most direct parody, right?


KEITH: Right, yeah. And…


SYLVIA: Hey guys, Austin’s Discord’s down. 


KEITH: Oh. 


DRE: Oh, that’s bad. 


KEITH: Bummer. Yeah. Maybe restarting will…


ART: Oh, I didn’t know he put that picture in the chat. 


DRE: Uh-oh. 


KEITH: Oh, yeah. 


DRE: We just lost Sylvia[1], too.


ART: It’s taking everyone. 


DRE: Oh, god. (starts laughing)


KEITH: Oh no- Who’s Next?!


ART: This is like The Thing, one of us is really the Discord monster. 


KEITH: Yeah. The first- Uhp!


SYLVIA: So. 


DRE: Uhp?


SYLVIA: Is Discord down for me now too, or are people still here?


ART: All right, well. Let’s just... stay here, and quietly..


KEITH: Yeah. I mean, we could talk about-


ART: ...wait for our own deaths. 


DRE: (laughing)


KEITH: I mean, until we die we could talk about... if you should watch Bajillion Dollar Properties or just skip it. (pause) It’s funny enough, there’s a lot of... I would say “questionable” jokes, in the first season-


ART: Okay.


KEITH: -that they seem to pretty much drop after the first season. But, it’s only eight episodes and it’s like, otherwise it’s fine? But, Randall Park is in the most recent season in an episode, and it’s like, it’s one of the best Randall Park scenes I’ve ever seen. So.


ART: Jess and I recently binge-watched... all three seasons of Fresh Off the Boat-


DRE: Uh-oh. There goes Art.


KEITH: Oh no. 


DRE: Oh god!


KEITH: Oh, no! 


ART (overlapping KEITH): -and really liked it. 


KEITH (overlapping ART, yelling): What did he binge-watch?!


ART: Like that’s a show that I did not give a chance because it has honestly the worst title in all of Christendom, but. 


KEITH (over the end of ART): If that was a joke, that was a great joke. 


DRE: Oh, god… (laughing)


ART: Is it just me now? Did you guys drop?


SYLVIA (light irony): Well, this is fun.


KEITH: Art left, literally...


DRE: (laughing)


ART: Uh-oh. 


DRE, laughing: This is horrifying. 


SYLVIA: Cause I, Discord’s just like-


KEITH: Oh no.


SYLVIA: -says I’m still on the call.


DRE: All right, well. We definitely have one thing for the Clapcast, from this… so... 


SYLVIA (crossing DRE): So I can’t like leave, so… 


DRE (crossing SYLVIA):  (laughing) from this session.


SYLVIA: I’ll just connect again… You know. I hope you’re enjoying this, Ali. I know you’re not going to listen to it cause we’re just gonna do a clap, but hey. (pause) Figured I’d, uh.. speak a little. (pause) Uhp, and it just went down for Art, too. 


DRE: Well, they’re all back online now. 


SYLVIA: Do I still have Skype installed?


DRE: Oh no, ah.


SYLVIA: I do have Skype installed.


(pause)


DRE: Is it me? Am I the dead one?


SYLVIA: (grossed out sound) That noise. 


(pause) 


KEITH: Hello!


SYLVIA: I hate this cursed program.


AUSTIN: I fucking hate this. I hate that we’re here. 


DRE (crossing ART, SYLVIA): Oh, throwback!


ART (crossing DRE, SYLVIA): Oh my god. What’s that fucking noise?


SYLVIA (crossing DRE, ART): Eugh. 


KEITH: Skype just sounds so bad!


DRE: Oh god, we sound awful!


SYLVIA: You guys legitimately sound worse.


KEITH: Yeah no, we all sound worse. 


DRE: Yeah. 


KEITH: It’s just the audio credits (sic) for Skype are garbage-


DRE: We sound bad. 


KEITH: It’s like when your parents don’t see the difference between their old tube TV and their new HD TV, until they have to see a tube TV again. 


DRE: (chuckles)


AUSTIN: Right, right. 


KEITH: And then they’re like “Wow this is worse, you were right.”


AUSTIN: This sucks. 


DRE: Yeah, this sounds bad. 


KEITH: Yeah. Yeah, you guys sound like- 


ART (overlapping KEITH): I hope that makes for a good-


KEITH (overlapping SYLVIA): -I mean, It sounds like a phone call. It sounds like a phone call.


ART: I hope that makes for a good Clapcast moment, as we all... drop out. 


AUSTIN, SYLVIA: (laughing)


DRE: A horror moment. 


SYLVIA: Fucking... horror movie. 


KEITH: I had to like, I had to Ctrl-Alt-Delete close Discord cause it wouldn’t let me leave the call. 


DRE: Yeah, no, same. 


ART: Yeah, me too. 


SYLVIA: Yup. And then when I started up Skype it wasn’t responding for a little bit? So…


AUSTIN: That sounds like Skype to me. 


KEITH: That sounds like Skype. 


SYLVIA (crossing KEITH): That was… really worrying. 


KEITH (crossing SYLVIA): Art, what did you binge-watch? You left, you dropped in the middle of that sentence. 


DRE: (cackling)


ART: Oh, Fresh Off the Boat. 


KEITH: Oh, okay. 


ART: That’s why I’m so into Randall Park right now, because him and.. him and the other one are really good in that. 


KEITH: Yeah. Yeah.


ART: The adults on that show are fantastic and the kids are terrible, and that was the really great realization they made in the second season.


KEITH: I haven’t seen the second season, what did they do to the kids? Did they, like, kill them off or-?


SYLVIA: (snorts, drops something) We’re all good now. 


ART: They dropped the narration and they refocused the show, so it’s like- instead of every episode being about Eddie, it’s more of like an ensemble piece. 


KEITH: Right, okay. 


ART: Everyone gets episodes now. 


KEITH: Yeah. (pause) Actually, maybe then I’ve only seen the second season. Or, past that. I’ve only seen a few episodes here and there, I haven’t seen.. like a bunch of it. 


ART: Cause Constance Wu and Randall Park are funnier than all children, really. Every child you’ve ever met. 


KEITH: Yeah. But yeah, I definitely recommend the Randall Park episode of... Bajillion Dollar Properties, also Paul F. Tompkins and Drew Tarver are great in it. Drew Tarver’s, like, fantastic. 


AUSTIN: Shoutouts to everyone else who’s messaging me telling me that… that they’ve gotten kicked out of their Discords, too. 


DRE: (laughing)

AUSTIN: Our friend Sean says, “I just got an error in my FFXIV Discord: ‘Servers are unavailable due to temporary outage.’” Our friend Nic says: “It just cut out on us in the middle of-” oh, fuckin-! Do not. I will kick you off of this call if you share another Moji!


DRE: (laughing)


SYLVIA: (laughing) Sorry… 


ART, DRE: (laughing) 


AUSTIN: God. 


SYLVIA: (laughing)


AUSTIN: I’m so mad. 


SYLVIA, laughing: It’s the worst. 


KEITH: Ah, you know what I haven’t seen in awhile? 


AUSTIN: I hate you, don’t even- don’t you dare. 


KEITH: There’s just, I just.. It’s.. been awhile since I’ve seen the turtle groovin’, and not just a static image. 


SYLVIA: (surpressed laughter)


AUSTIN: Is it even in here?


KEITH: I don’t see it. 


DRE: Yeah, where’s that turtle?


KEITH: I thought I could, I thought you could search for them but I don’t see a search.. thing. 


AUSTIN: Do a search for “turtle groovin’”. (chuckles) Do a search for “the grossest turtle that’s ever lived”. 


KEITH: What is this? What’s this? 


AUSTIN: Yeah!


SYLVIA: Nothing. I think this is avocado love. 


AUSTIN: No, that’s-


SYLVIA (crossing AUSTIN): Oh, but I don’t have updated Skype so-


AUSTIN (crossing SYLVIA): They’re fucking. Those avocados fuck. 


KEITH: Oh yeah, they are- it is two halves of an avocado that become a whole avocado. 


DRE: Wooah?! 


KEITH (crossing AUSTIN): And they are loving it. 


AUSTIN (crossing KEITH, concerned & amused): Yeah, one shoves its weird pit into the other one.


KEITH, laughing: It’s.. yes, it is- it is explicit. 


SYLVIA: See, this is helping me get into character because you all are seeing something online that I’m not, there we go. 


AUSTIN, DRE, KEITH all laugh. 


ART, incredulous: What is this?! Is that like- Is this some “hands across America, Skype pretending they’re gonna end racism” bullshit right here?! 


DRE, emphatic: Yes. 


KEITH: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Oh my god. 


ART: What’s the person on the right... wearing? 


AUSTIN: Well, Grand Magnificent... has.. 


DRE: (chuckles)


AUSTIN: Wait, is this not the.. I can’t..


KEITH: That is it, that’s it, that’s it. 


AUSTIN: I can’t see it, it won’t move for me. 


SYLVIA: Oh, I can see it. 


KEITH: I can see it. Oh, and I can hear it. 


SYLVIA: Holy shit. 


KEITH, yelling away from mic: Oh, those-


AUSTIN (crossing KEITH): So Paul Mccartney… is a musician-


KEITH (yelling away from mic, crossing AUSTIN): Oh, those Paul McCartney grooves!


AUSTIN: Did I tell y’all who I told about these recently? 


KEITH: Yeah, it was um… 


ART: It was like Yoko Ono, right?


AUSTIN, chuckling: It was Yoko Ono. (chuckles) And I said, “Listen… You gotta get into that.”


KEITH: (laughing) “Have you heard about the Mojis? You got with the wrong Beatle.”


AUSTIN: I had the good… I had the good fortune in my life to talk to... Toby Fox, creator of Undertale, on Skype. And I was like “loool-”. He was like “I haven’t been on Skype in forever!” and I was like “Loool, do you remember ‘Mojis?” And he was like “Oh, do you mean like those shitty little emoticons?” and I was like “Mhmhmhm, no.” And then I sent him Solo and Lovin’ It, music by Paul McCartney, and then sent him all the documentaries about Paul McCartney making Mojis? There are a number of videos about this, that we should link to… people who are listening to this Clapcast right now (chuckling) which is what this has become.  


DRE: (chuckling) 


AUSTIN: Oh there it is, it’s appeared! (pause) Badum buh buh, bum budaduh, budadumbumbah (to boppy turtle tune). 


KEITH: Solo and Lovin’ It. 


DRE: Oh god, I didn’t know it played music too. 


AUSTIN: Oh, yeah. 


KEITH: Yeah, written by Paul McCartney. 


AUSTIN: By Paul F. Tompkins McCartney. 


DRE & KEITH laugh.


AUSTIN: Fuck, I almost- I went to go link an image of this into our Discord! And I just remembered our Discord is down! God dammit! Okay, we should get to it. I’m so mad… God. (sigh)


KEITH: Oh man, I forgot how many Ted Emojis- TedMojis they had. 


AUSTIN, sarcastically: Oh, good. 


KEITH: Oh man, you can’t even begin to imagine how many things I can say to you via Ted. 


ART: What’s this one?


DRE: God, they’re so loud. 


KEITH: I don’t know.. I don’t know if this is a new Skype feature, but like.. On the call, the chat thing is so small that I can’t even see a full Moji at a time. 


AUSTIN: That’s a feature, that’s intentional I’m sure. All right, are we ready?


SYLVIA: Yeah. I’m ready. 


KEITH: I’m ready. I’m more, I’m more than ready. 


AUSTIN: This has thrown me way off. 


KEITH: God, we all sound so bad now. 


AUSTIN: I know, but we sound good to each other- to ourselves, right? That’s all that matters. 


KEITH: Right, yeah yeah yeah.


ART: Well, I worry that like my dep-... that it’s making me sound worse, like emotionally. 


AUSTIN (crossing ART): Oh, here’s an actual… important thing-


ART (crossing AUSTIN): Like I’m crestfallen about Skype.


SYLVIA: I’d say the only thing to keep an eye on is, remember how it adjusts the gain sometimes?


AUSTIN: Yes. 


DRE: Oh, yeah.


AUSTIN: Open up, open up your settings with the little wi-fi looking bar, make sure it says “automatically adjust microphone settings: off.” Cause that will ruin our whole fuckin’ day. It already did it for me, god damnit!


DRE: Okay, yeah mine’s off.


KEITH: Oh mine are good.


AUSTIN: Literally all- it lowered me down to like 20 percent on my-


SYLVIA, excited: Discord’s back!


AUSTIN: Oh, thank fucking Christ.


KEITH, quickly: Bye!


SYLVIA, AUSTIN, DRE laugh.


(pause)


DRE: Shit, my Discord’s not back. Ah, god. (pause) Ah, fuck.


SYLVIA: I’m in. 


KEITH: Uhp, there we go.


KEITH and SYLVIA, simultaneously: Hello?


(pause)


SYLVIA: Oh no. 


KEITH: Hello?


SYLVIA: Wait- Hey, there you go!


KEITH: Uhp, there we go.


SYLVIA: There you are! (relieved sigh)


KEITH: Yeah, I joined the voice channel and it took like 20 seconds, but I’m in.


SYLVIA: It took a bit… It took a bit, but it works.


KEITH: Yeah, it scared me.


SYLVIA: Yeah. (pause) Also, I made a GIF of the Solo but Loving It turtle.


KEITH: Good. 


SYLVIA: Nooo, not everyone’s back. (sigh)


(pause, DRE sighs) 


KEITH: I guess I’ll join this... call. Hello?


AUSTIN: I hate this. 


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: I hate it. I hate it. 


KEITH: So, what’s going on with you guys?


SYLVIA: Oh god, I didn’t leave the Discord call so I’m in there with Keith still.


KEITH: (laughs)


AUSTIN: Wait, is Keith connected too?


ART, incredulous: You and Keith are in Discord?! What the-


KEITH: Yeah, we both got in, like right away. 


AUSTIN, incredulous: What is this bullshit?!


DRE: (laughs)


KEITH: Well it did take- here’s the thing: it did take like… It did take like 15 seconds to get in there. (pause) Oh, my audio’s all blown out now, what’s going on?


AUSTIN: Yeah, Skype fucked us.


KEITH: Discord end task. Okay. Uhp, bup bup bup bup. (pause) I think Skype… since the last time I was in the call, to now… ruined my settings. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, it lowered me to like twenty percent volume, during that last little bit. 


DRE: Great. 


KEITH: (sings a loud, upbeat tune) Talking regular now, this is regular regular. Okay, now I’m good. Yeah it raised my settings actually, to be higher. 


AUSTIN: (frustrated sigh)


KEITH: (sing-song) Anyway, what’s going on? Wait, so what was going on with you guys, that Discord wasn’t working?


AUSTIN: Oh hold up, wait one second, I got a good video for everybody. I’m very excited. (pause) This is so bad…


SYLVIA: Uuhh. 


KEITH, yelling away from mic: Oh, five minutes of it! Oh, thank god.


ART, chuckling: Oh, my god. 


DRE, annoyed: I really hate when, like… services put like jokey stuff on their messages where it says like, “yeah our shit’s not working.” 


AUSTIN: Me too. 


DRE, annoyed: Like.. Discord says “the hamster wheel appears to be loose.” Just say your shit’s not working.


AUSTIN: Just say your shit is broken. 


DRE: (chuckles)


KEITH: Hold on, I just realized something about this turtle. If you look at the turtle, he is not crossing his arms around to his shell-


AUSTIN, laughing: Oh my god!


KEITH (crossing with AUSTIN, DRE): He is, they’re on the same side- and his hands...


AUSTIN (crossing with KEITH, DRE): Oh no!


DRE (crossing with AUSTIN, KEITH): (yelling)


SYLVIA: Wait…


(KEITH laughing loudly)


AUSTIN: Oh no! (laughing)


ART: His elbows are bending the wrong way!


KEITH: His elbows are bending the wrong way. 


SYLVIA: Sometimes my arms bend back.


AUSTIN: (laughs)


KEITH: (laughs)


ART: All right, I can literally never look at this again in my life. 


SYLVIA: (humming the song) I’m a minute in, still going.


KEITH: Wow… (crossing with AUSTIN) That’s… so bizarre. 


AUSTIN (crossing with KEITH): There’s another video, this one it loops better? It’s nice. 


DRE: Ah, it doesn’t even loop well.


AUSTIN (crossing KEITH): The one that I just linked does. 


KEITH (crossing AUSTIN): No, it doesn’t. 


ART: No, it doesn’t. I mean, I guess it wasn’t designed to. 


KEITH: No, this one loops well. 


AUSTIN: Wait, the one I just linked totally does. 


ART: I’m back in, I’m back in Discord. 


AUSTIN: Wait, can no one hear me? Can no one hear me?


DRE (crossing with SYLVIA): I can hear you I can hear you, you’re really quiet. 


SYLVIA (crossing with DRE): You’re super fucking quiet. 


ART (crossing with AUSTIN): Yeah, you’re just getting quieter and quieter. 


AUSTIN (crossing with ART): God damnit!


ART: It’s like you’re.. you’re stricken with some sort of quiet disease. 


AUSTIN: (laughs) (fake-shouting) I linked a louder- I linked a better turtle. I linked a better turtle. 


KEITH: Yeah, no I talked about it. It is better, I talked about it. 


AUSTIN, relieved: Okay. 


ART: I’m back on Discord.


DRE: Oh, this is a much better turtle. Yeah, this loops a lot better. 


KEITH: Yeah, yeah they loop it a lot better in this one. Yeah do you guys wanna try Discord one more time, see if it works for you?


SYLVIA: It’s still not loading for me. 


DRE: I have it… on, and it’s just trying to connect in the background. 


KEITH: Huh. We could like, do Skype until the next break? And switch back over to Discord. 


SYLVIA: The thing is, if it’s fucking with Austin’s mic… 


AUSTIN: Yeah, I can’t fuck with this shit. 


SYLVIA: Yeah. 


KEITH: Oh, you’re saying like we can’t do- we can’t go until Discord is better?


AUSTIN: Or until Skype, makes it so you can hear me. 


DRE: Should we do like a Google hangout instead, or something?


AUSTIN: Maybe…


KEITH: Wait, hold on… (laughs) Oh, I saw the tweet. The Skype tweet.


AUSTIN, amused: Yeah, good. 


ART: Oh, my god. 


KEITH: Could Paul McCartney have… made some fuckin’ better music for this shit?


AUSTIN: (laughs)


SYLVIA: I mean, he made fuckin’ Temporary Secretary? I’m too not surprised that he made something this bad?


AUSTIN: Wait! ...Oh, okay.


ART: Also, if you’re Paul McCartney are you like, “I’m going to go. To Skype. And I’m gonna make the next Yesterday.” Or are you like “I’m Paul McCartney, I’m just going to do whatever and they’re gonna pay me five million dollars.”


SYLVIA (crossing ART): I’m just gonna make some electronic fart noises and put a horny turtle to it. 


DRE: (laughs)


ART (crossing SYLVIA): I’m surprised he could get-


KEITH: Cause like this, this horny turtle has nothing to do with this weird (sings the boppy tune). Like, that’s insane. Like that’s an insane pairing. This is just a horny turtle, make some horny turtle music.


DRE: Uhp, my Discord’s back. 


AUSTIN: Mine is not, I’m gonna relaunch it.


SYLVIA: Mine’s not. “Ten servers- ten servers are unavailable...”


KEITH: Wait, Sylvia yours are gone again?


SYLVIA: Yeah, my thing like… fucked up, when I tried to hang up on it? To join the Skype call again?


KEITH: Oh. 


SYLVIA: And... it just kept disconnecting and reconnecting?


KEITH: Did you uh…


DRE: Ah, fuck.


KEITH: -like close the program, force it closed and reopen it?


SYLVIA: Yeah. 


KEITH: Weird. 


AUSTIN: Oh, I’m back! I’m back on Skype. Wait, one server is unavailable. 


SYLVIA: I’ve got six are unavailable. 


AUSTIN: I hate this. I hate this. Do you know what’s unavailable?


SYLVIA: Is it Friends at the Table?


AUSTIN: It’s Friends at the Table. 


DRE: Yeah, I was in but now it’s like kicking me in and out of the voice chat. 


SYLVIA: That’s what happened to me. We might have to make a Google hangout. 


ART (crossing AUSTIN): We could a, we could make a private voice channel on Fans at the Ta-


AUSTIN (crossing ART): Wait, Friends at the Table is back.


ART: Okay. 


AUSTIN: We could have done that. 


SYLVIA: I don’t have that, so no we can’t. 


AUSTIN: Wait, are you not on.. Fra- Oh, you don’t have- I see. 


SYLVIA: I’m on it, I just don’t have it, like alive right now, on Discord.


KEITH, cautiously: I’ve got everything back currently? So I think-


AUSTIN: Me too. 


KEITH: -I think we’re close. 


AUSTIN: I’m checking their tweets. 


(pause)


SYLVIA: I have the status thing up, too. 


AUSTIN: They’re saying it’s back. (pause) I think.


ART: Okay, bye forever Skype. 


AUSTIN: I fuckin’ hate Skype. 


SYLVIA: (singing the boppy turtle tune)


AUSTIN, DRE: (laughing)


AUSTIN: Jesus Christmas. Holy hell.


KEITH: Hello. 


ART: Hi.


(SYLVIA singing the boppy turtle tune in the background through this section, until they talk)


KEITH: Oh my god, it sounds so clear! It’s like an ear wizard (sic)!


ART: Oh my god, this must have been like when they invented the telephone for this first time.


AUSTIN: This sounds so good!


ART: I know!


SYLVIA: Can we use Solo and Lovin’ It for the theme for Bluff CIty so Jack doesn’t have to do work?


AUSTIN, mob voice: This week in Bluff City- (sings boppy turtle tune)


SYLVIA: (chuckling)


(miscellaneous percussive mouth sounds)


ART: You know who I hear are not litigious: The Beatles and Microsoft. 


AUSTIN, SYLVIA, KEITH, DRE: (laugh loudly)


AUSTIN, laughing: Oh, fuck. 


SYLVIA: Holy shit. 


(KEITH laughing in background) 


AUSTIN: What a disaster, okay. 


KEITH: Oh, boy… What a good.. What a wild Clapcast that’s gonna be. 


DRE: Should we… like start a new recording? 


AUSTIN: Yeah, we probably should. Let’s start a new recording. 


SYLVIA: New recording? Straight up? All right. 


DRE: Clap first? 


AUSTIN, yelling: Wait, wait wait wait! We have to time.is! We have to clap first. 


ART: I’ve already saved this as “Clapcast-2-name.”


AUSTIN, KEITH: (laughs)


AUSTIN: All right, let’s clap at 20?


(pause)

AUSTIN: Yes? Yes?


ART, KEITH, DRE: Yeah. 


(group clap)
