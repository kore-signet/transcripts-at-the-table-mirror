DRE: I’ve been playing the latest hotness on Game Pass: Dragon Quest Builders 2 [laughs]. 
AUSTIN: Hell yeah. Love to fuckin’ build.
SYLVI: I’ve heard that game’s really fun.
DRE: It’s- it’s a fun game.
AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah, it’s good, it’s good. I’m pro.
SYLVI: I- I do love to just look at Dragon Quest games-
DRE: -Mhm-
SYLVI: -To be honest, so…
AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah. I’ve put a lot into that, that most recent full--uh, was that… was that twelve? [typing]
SYLVI: Eleven.
AUSTIN: Eleven.
SYLVI: Eleven’s really good.
DRE: Yeah.
SYLVI: I need to finish it.
AUSTIN: I’m like, not halfway through it, but I’m like, at the end of the first act, I think, basically. Um, and was really enjoying it, it was like, extremely chill and-
SYLVI: -It’s-
AUSTIN: -vibes were great.
SYLVI: Yeah, no, I, it’s- it’s… I have it on the Switch-
AUSTIN: -Yep.
SYLVI: -and it feels very perfect for that.
DRE: Oh, yeah. That’s where I played it. That was great.
AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah, yeah. It’s so good, it’s so good. 
SYLVI: Yeah.
AUSTIN: I’m at like, I think it’s like…I’m post the first- I know you go to all the places a bunch of times, basically. I think I’m at the first- I’ve finished the desert place, um…The first time, my party is complete at this point, you know? Um-
SYLVI: Yeah.
AUSTIN: -But I have -And I - Oh! And I did the shit of like…I went back to the place the game starts for the first time. 
DRE: [realisation] Oh! Yeah.
SYLVI: [cross] Okay.
AUSTIN: And shit is different there? And you’re like [panicked] uhhh! What’s poppin’ here? Why is everyone… hm! That’s weird! So, that is, that is…
SYLVI: Okay. Yeah.
AUSTIN: Uh… I- you know. It’s very obvious what’s happening there.
SYLVI: [cross] You- You were doing a greatsword build with your hero too, right?
AUSTIN: I was doing a greatsword build, yeah.
SYLVI: Fuckin’ rules!
DRE: Oooh.
AUSTIN: It really rules, yeah.
KEITH: [cross] Hello!
SYLVI: Yeah.
AUSTIN: Welcome back!
SYLVI: [cross] Hello!
DRE: [cross] Hello!
KEITH: More MMOs?
AUSTIN, SYLVI and DRE: [cross] No.
AUSTIN: Well- No.
SYLVI: A little bit. [laughs]
AUSTIN and SYLVI: [cross] Dragon Quest 11-
AUSTIN: -which does have some, like- The way that you’re exploring the open world and grinding for stuff is something that’s so classic JRPG that it f- it can feel MMO-y, when it’s a third person thing-
SYLVI: -Yeah.
AUSTIN: -you know? Uh, but no. It’s just a classic JRPG. 
KEITH: Is that the one that I played? Is that the one with Trunks on the cover?
DRE: Yes.
SYLVI: [laughs loudly] Yeah.
AUSTIN: I gotta tell ya, I gotta tell ya, that’s all of them, but yes. Trunks is on the cover.
SYLVI: [laughs] Yeah, Trunks is also the main character of 7. Just this different, different Trunks.
AUSTIN: [cross] Is that true? Let’s see… Uh… Yeah, that’s Trunks, also.
KEITH: Ah, okay, yeah-
AUSTIN: -Yeah, these are all Trunks to me.
KEITH: -this is the one. Yeah, I uh, I put not very much time into this.
AUSTIN: Okay.
KEITH: But it seems okay.
AUSTIN: Yeah, I’m enjoying it. Anyway, I haven’t played it in months now, but it just came up because Dragon Quest Builders came up which is also fun.
DRE: Yeah.
AUSTIN: Anyway.
SYLVI: I even- I didn’t mean Dragon Quest 7, I meant Dragon Quest 8-
AUSTIN: You meant eight. You did.
SYLVI: -but Dragon Quest 7 also stars a Trunks [laughs].
AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah. Eight’s the one with the, like, the yellow and blue clothes [cross] with the bandana guy?
SYLVI: [cross] Yeah, you get that costume in eleven, I think-
AUSTIN: Gotcha.
SYLVI: -in the special version.
AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah.
SYLVI: That’s the one with everyone’s favourite King Trode little guy. [laughs]
AUSTIN: Mhm.
KEITH: I’m looking at eight, and eight actually unfortunately stars a Gohan. [laughs]
[pause]
AUSTIN: Oh, that is a Gohan.
SYLVI: [cross] That’s fair. That’s fair.
AUSTIN: That’s a Gohan. You’re right. Eleven is a Trunks-
KEITH: There’s a Trunks right in the background there though, and there’s also a Hercule there.
[pause]
AUSTIN: Yeah. Uh-huh. Yes. You’re not wrong.
KEITH: [laughs loudly] Look, I love Akira Toriyama and I love this art and I love, just, him being able to like, “yeah, I just do these… guys. I just keep-”
AUSTIN: [imitating] [cross] “These are the guys that I do.”
KEITH: “-these are the guys that I do. Take it or leave it.” And then it’s like, thirty years- forty years, of people being like “oh, take it! We’ll take it!” [laughs]
AUSTIN: “Please, give more, please”.
SYLVI: It’s ‘cause it’s good!
AUSTIN: It’s good!
KEITH: [cross] Yeah!
AUSTIN: Okay, here’s a question: Dragon Quest 5. Is it another Gohan to you? Who is this?
KEITH: Dragon Quest 5… 
AUSTIN: Yeah, do a search for five.
KEITH: Okay… Yeah, that’s another Gohan, that’s actually even more of a Gohan. I almost said-
AUSTIN: He has a ponytail, though, and that’s a new vibe.
SYLVI: There’s a little bit of Yamcha-
KEITH: [cross] I’m gonna say-
SYLVI: [cross] - in the ponytail, I’m gonna be honest.
AUSTIN: [cross] Oh there is a little bit of Yamcha.
KEITH: - I’m gonna say, I’m actually gonna say that this image I’m looking at of the Gohan in Dragon Quest 5, it looks like his, like, Frieza saga era hair?
AUSTIN: Uh… [searching]
KEITH: Right?
SYLVI: Oh, a little bit.
AUSTIN: A little bit, but there is a ponytail. It’s not coming through in the image you’re looking at-
KEITH: Yeah.
AUSTIN: - but he do got that ponytail.
SYLVI: [cross] There’s also an Android-
[00:04:00]
SYLVI: - 19 hanging out in there. [cross] At the bottom.
KEITH: [cross] Yeah.
DRE: [cross] There is, yeah.
AUSTIN: [cross] That is an Android 19 with him, in the image I’m looking at, yeah. Uh-huh, uh-huh.
KEITH: And this, this one’s got a Hercule!
[pause]
AUSTIN: This one- Oh yes [laughs] it does.
[Keith laughs]
AUSTIN: Okay, Dragon Quest 3 is the most Gohan there’s ever been.
[pause]
KEITH: Oh yeah, absolutely.
DRE: [cross] Oh yeah, that’s 100% Gohan.
KEITH: [cross] Yeah, that one’s- that one’s-  yeah, yeah. Yeah totally.
SYLVI:         [after a short pause] [laughs] Damn!
KEITH: Yeah.
[pause]
KEITH: It’s fine, do it. I mean, like, I, uh-
SYLVI: I was gonna be, like, Gohan with a sword, but-
AUSTIN: Gohan with a sword.
SYLVI: - there’s a whole arc in the Buu saga where he gets a sword.
AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah, he gets a sword.
DRE: [cross] Yeah, it’s a sweet sword.
AUSTIN: That’s right. Yeah. Uh-huh.
[pause]
AUSTIN: Alright, we should get back to this game. [laughs]
KEITH: [cross] That’s so funny.
[pause]
AUSTIN: Okay, but Dragon Quest 6?
KEITH: Okay.
AUSTIN: [laughs] Is actually looking into the future from when it came out.
KEITH: Oh, because that’s-
AUSTIN: Right.
KEITH: - because that’s- that’s ‘Dragon Ball Super Hair.’
AUSTIN: That’s ‘Dragon Ball Super Hair.’ That’s super saiyan, blue super saiyan.
KEITH: Yeah-
AUSTIN: Or, whatever- god super saiyan.
DRE: [cross] Yeah.
SYLVI: I do think it looks better than the blue super saiyan.
AUSTIN: I think it does too. I think it looks kinda sick, honestly. [laughs]
KEITH: [slowly] Yeah… yeah.
SYLVI: [quietly] It looks really nice.
AUSTIN: You know what I do appreciate? Is-
[00:05:00]
KEITH: [sighs] Yeah.
AUSTIN: -Trunks is once again just in the background.
SYLVI: [laughs hard]
KEITH: Yeah.
AUSTIN: If you take a look here-
KEITH: And then [cross] there’s Android 16 just- Literally Android 16’s right there.
AUSTIN: Uh-huh. Yeah, I already- Yeah-
SYLVI: There’s kind of-
AUSTIN - Android 16, yeah.
SYLVI: - two Trunkses in Dragon Quest 11, also, actually. The thief guy’s a little bit of a Trunks too.
AUSTIN: Oh, you know what, he is kind of a Trunks. I forgot about the thief guy.
SYLVI: Yeah.
KEITH: But, the, but the, the flipside is like, imagine being able to invent a Trunks, and not just doing it all the time.
AUSTIN: Yeah-
DRE: No, fair, yeah.
AUSTIN: - no, listen, I get it.
SYLVI: [laughs]
AUSTIN: I get it, I do.
KEITH: If I could make a Trunks, [cross] I’d constantly be making Trunkses.
AUSTIN: [cross] Do you know how hard it is not to put Ibex in every season? Yeah, uh-huh. [laughs]
SYLVI: Next season we’re all gonna play Ibexes.
KEITH: [cross] I wonder why there’s not a lot of-
DRE: [reacts to Sylvi] Hell yeah!
KEITH: - Vegetas in Dragon Quest?
[pause]
DRE: That’s a good question.
SYLVI: Uh… [pause] You know, I feel like there might be a couple, but they’re not, like, party members.
AUSTIN: Right, villain Vegetas.
KEITH: Oh.
SYLVI: Yeah, I feel like the Vegeta face shows up mostly in antagonistic roles.
[00:06:00]
AUSTIN: [sighs] Bruh, I gotta tell you, Dragon Quest 10 might be the squad.
SYLVI: Dragon Quest-? Oh, I wanna play it, it’s the MMO one. I cannot get it here.
AUSTIN: Is this the MMO one? Are they not putting it out here? Aren’t they doing, uh-
SYLVI: I don’t think it was ever going to-
AUSTIN: Aren’t they doing the offline mode of it?
DRE: Oh, maybe.
SYLVI: Are they really?
AUSTIN: This- Hold up.
KEITH: And this guy is almost-
SYLVI: [cross] I’m not seeing anything here.
AUSTIN: [cross] This is squad goals to me, this right here is squad goals. Except for the main guy. The human guy? Boring. But everybody around hangin’ is fucking fly as hell.
DRE: [cross] I’m gonna see if you’re looking at the same picture.
SYLVI: [cross] Yeah.
DRE: Yes, that is literally the picture. [laughs]
AUSTIN: Yeah.
KEITH: That middle, that middle one there, or that first Dragon Quest 10 one is what I was looking at.
AUSTIN: Yeah yeah yeah.
KEITH: Yeah.
[pause]
AUSTIN: I- So they announced Dragon Quest 10 offline mode, was revealed last year, was delayed until this summer, but I don’t know that it was ever…
SYLVI: I don’t -
AUSTIN: Given a Western release.
SYLVI: Yeah. I remember that there was something, like they were doing something with Dragon Quest 10.
AUSTIN: Yeah.
SYLVI: I just didn’t think that it was gonna be over here.
AUSTIN: They should.
[00:07:00]
SYLVI: Which sucks because I want-
AUSTIN: That does suck..
SYLVI: Dragon Quest 9 [00:07:03] you can create your character-
AUSTIN: Yeah.
SYLVI: Which is fun but-- 
AUSTIN: Was that the DS one or the 3DS one?
SYLVI [cross]: Yeah, it's a DS one.
AUSTIN: Yeah, I played that, that was sick.
DRE: Man, they’re still making...
KEITH: Dragon Quests.
DRE: New Dragon Quest 10.
AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
DRE: Man.
SYLVI: I mean Dragon Quest is huge, right?
KEITH: I--I have never been, besides Builders, I had never really been hooked into one-
AUSTIN: Mhm.
KEITH: Which is why I tried to play 11 because people were really hot on it for a long time.
AUSTIN: Yeah.
KEITH: And it was, like, on Games Pass and so I was--
SYLVI: Yeah.
KEITH: --like let me give this a shot. It was during--it was like, uh-- if anybody had been listening to the RunButton podcast around that time, it was in the middle of me being like, “I just don’t like turn-based RPGs.”
AUSTIN: JRPGS? Yeah...
KEITH: Not just RPG--
AUSTIN: That’s fair.
KEITH: Not just JRPGs.
AUSTIN: Any.
KEITH:  I just don’t like turn based RPGs that aren’t Pokemon.
AUSTIN: Sure.
SYLVI: Huh.
DRE: Mmm.
KEITH: [laughs] Like, I just don’t- I just-- every time I play one I'm just like, I could just be playing Pokemon instead.
AUSTIN: And Pokemon is mechanically such a more complex and interesting tactical decision-making game than Dragon Quest is. And I like Dragon Quest, but it’s not doing the same--Dragon Quest is, you know, it is the storybook that people talk about it as. It is the, like, “I'm gonna go to bed and just play this very nice, relaxing JRPG,” but, like, I’m not making intense decisions the way I am in, like a hard Pokemon fight.
KEITH: And-
SYLVI: You’ll get like one fight like that every, like, fifteen hours.
AUSTIN: Yes, exactly, exactly.
KEITH: And I know, I know that, you know, when I say something like “I don’t like turn-based RPGs...” It sounds like I’m just saying shit. But usually when I say stuff like that I also am at the same time being like, “Let me play some turn-based RPGs”-
AUSTIN: [cross]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SYLVI: [cross] Yeah.
KEITH: [cross] -to make sure I’m not being an asshole for no reason.
AUSTIN: You’re not--That’s not particularly--I don't think that you’re being dismissive when you say you don’t like them, you know? 
KEITH: [cross] Yeah.
SYLVI: [cross]: I mean I think there’s a--
AUSTIN: [cross] That’s just your taste, you’re allowed to have your taste.
SYLVI: --like a type of, like it is one of those, like there are genres I grate up against--
AUSTIN: Yeah!
KEITH: Yeah.
SYLVI: --just because they don’t, like, vibe with my brain and I can totally understand why turn-based RPGS are like that.
KEITH: And, well, and part of it is not just not liking the mechanics but it’s also, like, for all of the pros and cons that Pokemon has and there are a heap of each--
AUSTIN: Uh-huh.
KEITH: The thing that another turn-based RPG can’t really do for me is give me the, like, nostalgia scratch?
AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah yeah. True.
KEITH: Where it’s like, “It is, like, a pretty good one of these, for its faults,” and also I’ve been playing Pokemon since I was four years old.
AUSTIN: Right. Yeah, it goes [hums five notes of the Pokemon theme] and part of your head goes “Aww yeah, that’s the stuff!”
KEITH: Yeah, uh-huh.
AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. I get it. [beat] Alright--
KEITH: Wow, really, I was four years old when I started playing Pokemon, that’s crazy.
DRE: [disbelieving sigh through teeth]
AUSTIN: That’s wild.
SYLVI: [laughs]
AUSTIN: Alright, let’s do a 3-2-1 clap.
SYLVI: Alright.
DRE: Sure.
AUSTIN: Just to sync, just to let Ali know.
DRE: Alright.
AUSTIN: Three, two, one--
[four distinct claps]
[excerpt of Break-the-Curse plays]
[00:09:54]
ALI: Should I get this The Mandalorian advent calendar for eleven dollars off of--
AUSTIN: [cross] No. No, no--
ALI: The William Sonoma website?
AUSTIN: [cross] No, no--wait; is it an official one--
ALI: Yeah!
AUSTIN: -or is it one of these fake ones?
JANINE: [laughing]
ALI: [laughing] Wait, what do you mean “is it one of these fake ones?”
[Crosstalk]
ART: Does William Sonoma sell bootleg--[laughs]
JANINE: One that's full of dinosaur erasers.
AUSTIN: Have you not seen these?
JANINE: Fishing lures, Mandalorian fishing lures.
AUSTIN: Yeah, did y’all not see the fake advent calendar boom this year?
JACK: No.
ALI: No!
ART: I did, yeah.
AUSTIN: Oh god.
JANINE: Oh my god.
AUSTIN: So--
ALI: [laughing] I’m sorry.
AUSTIN: So-
JANINE: Picture--hang on--
ART: But they’re not coming from the WIlliam Sonoma website. [laughs]
JANINE: [cross] Picture--
AUSTIN: You don’t know that!
JANINE: I think they were mostly Facebook ads but you know, the nutshell thing is like, picture a plastic case that you would use to perhaps organize your thread or your beads or some sort of crafting thing.
ALI [cross]: Sure.
JACK: Yep.
AUSTIN: Uh-huh.
JANINE: But instead of like a cover, there is like a plastic sheet. And on that plastic sheet is-
JACK: [laughing] Oh no.
AUSTIN: For instance--
JANINE: --something that has nothing at all to do, or only vaguely to do with some subject. Like say you order a Steelers themed sports advent calendar, and then the picture on the front is David Bowie. [laughs]
[laughter]
JANINE: [laughing] For example.
AUSTIN: [cross] You could get closer--
JANINE: Or a Broadway-themed one and it’s like a weird desktop wallpaper.
AUSTIN: Yes. The one that I followed week to week, or rather day to day, was this one of the Dungeons and Dragons, it was supposed to be a Dungeons and Dragons advent calendar--
ALI: [gasps quietly]
JACK: Oh, this is amazing!
AUSTIN: It was supposed--okay. It was supposed to look like this, [begins laughing], which is an image of the Player’s Handbook--
ALI: [gasps loudly]
[laughter]
AUSTIN: [laughing] --but in fact, it was an image from the 2005 movie with Marlon Wayans in it, and, yeah, uh-huh.
JANINE: Which we’ve seen, right?
AUSTIN: Yeah, we watched that together, Janine, yeah.
JANINE: Yes.
AUSTIN: And, if you just scroll through this thread--
JANINE: [cross] Highly recommend it.
AUSTIN: [skeptical] Mmm, okay. Uh, you’ll start to see what was behind some of these things, like this Biyomon from Digimon, or this fishing lure, or this egg full of dinosaurs, or this other egg full of dinosaurs.
JANINE: [simultaneously] [laughing] Or this other egg full of dinosaurs.
AUSTIN: [cross] [laughing] Or this third egg full of dinosaurs.
ART: [cross] None of these things are things you couldn’t use for Dungeons and Dragons.
AUSTIN: I know! I know! I know! Eventually they do get to a little skeleton figure, like a skeleton lich or something.
JANINE: Also some, like, blue stones that might be, like, counters for some kind of game?
AUSTIN: [cross] Um. Yeah. I really love there are lots of, there are more than one rubber duck, there is more than one Among Us Lego kit, in here.
[laughing]
AUSTIN: And so here’s the thing. Independently of this, I was hanging out with my friend Holly, who co-owns the Kew and WIllow bookstore in, in--
JACK: [cross] Great bookstore.
AUSTIN: Great bookstore, love it, love Holly.
ART: You could have bought a book advent calendar and it was just dinosaurs and...
AUSTIN: [cross] She and her mom...she and her mom got the Broadway one, the Broadway musical one. It was the same shit.
ALI: [gasps]
ART: No!
AUSTIN: It was dinosaurs and it was a little Among Us figure, and weird cubes. Uh, I think she did get one like Hamilton pin and I want to say something vaguely related to Phantom of the Opera. Um.
JANINE: Yeah the D&D one had like, a couple miniatures in it right?
AUSTIN: Uh--at most--
[Crosstalk]
AUSTIN: If you count these dinosaurs--dinosaurs are like dragons, you know?
[laughter]
JANINE: [doubtful noise] That’s true...
AUSTIN: So--[laughs] but it’s very funny. So, be careful of advent calendars, is what I’m saying.
JACK: [cross] I know!
ALI: Thank you.
JACK: Throw caution to the wind, Ali, let’s go!
ALI: [laughs]
AUSTIN: I really do want to know what’s behind it now. I do want to know what’s in that Manalorian advent Calendar.
ART: [cross] They might just tell you.
JANINE: I mean, the other side of things is like, there’s also just a market for, like, totally legit and very expensive advent calendars that are also just full of garbage.
AUSTIN: [cross]: Right, right.
JANINE: Like the big one--every year there’s a couple that, like, some big brand does and everyone is like, “Oh my god, did you see this shit?” Sephora did one once, it was like. I don’t know, like 50 bucks and it was just full of sheet masks. Um, the big one this year was Chanel’s which had like, it was like, something like 800 dollars and it’s mostly full of stickers.
[laughter]
JACK: Wow!
JANINE: Like keyboard stickers or like, little like, weird things, like shit like that, and a couple, like, miniature lipsticks or like miniature perfumes. 
[group sighing]
JANINE: You gotta, you gotta... you can’t trust anyone.
AUSTIN: You can’t.
ALI: I mean, but a Chanel sticker is worth forty dollars, or whatever.
JANINE: So that’s the thing is like, I watched a video of someone unboxing this and in the comments someone was like “Hey, I was at Chanel, like I worked at Chanel counters for a while, and all of these things are things that we gave out as freebies at some point.”
AUSTIN: [knowing humming]
ALI: Yeah, it’s just a stock room of this shit. Same with the little dinosaurs--
JANINE: [cross] Yeah. Yeah.
AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah...yes!
ALI: It’s like, “I have to move these Among Us toys that I have.” [laughing]
AUSTIN: Yeah, “I went in too hard on the Among Us toys, I thought we were gonna get another six months of Amogus memes and we did not, so.”
JACK: Is this what’s in the Mandalorian calendar?
ART: It’s so many...dinosaurs by the end of this.
ALI: [cross] Yeah, yeah.
AUSTIN: Wait, this is supposed, this is candy.
JANINE: [cross] Oh, that’s just can-- that’s probably fine
JACK: [cross] Quite disappointing.
AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah, this is probably good.
JANINE: I mean, there’s not gonna be a Gabumon in there, but.
AUSTIN: [chuckle] Yeah, I think every advent calendar should have at least one Digimon in it..
[excerpt of Break-the-Curse plays]
[00:15:15]
JACK: Art’s like, “I like the shade of the yellow wallpaper!”
[laughter]
KEITH: Did you have a bad experience with the yellow wallpaper, Jack?
JACK: [laughing] Yeah. The Yellow Wallpaper is the horror book. 
KEITH: Oh, I know it.
JACK: A woman gets trapped behind some yellow wallpaper, as her whole family insists that the yellow wallpaper is not demonic. That’s a little reductive, but that’s sort of what happens.
JANINE: [cross] Yeah, what’s it about wallpaper colour and horror...
JACK: [cross] It’s very Sangfielle!
KEITH: Amityville horrible wallpaper.
JACK: Yeah! It’s the--I might have this wrong but I think, based on something I heard in Just King Things, the family in the Amityville horror are the Lutz family. Um, which, I don’t know if they’re distant relatives of Michael.
AUSTIN: Probably.
JANINE: Yeah.
AUSTIN: I have a friend who’s--you, Art, also do--who lived out, like, near that house.
JACK: Oh, really?
AUSTIN: Mhm.
KEITH: Is it in Connecticut?
AUSTIN: No, it’s in Long Island. It's in Suffolk.
KEITH: Yeah, I--oh ok. I thought it was in Connecticut. I don’t know why.
AUSTIN: Suffolk’s basically Connecticut, in my experience. It’s out east of where Art and I went to school, basically. By a little bit. And uh, our friend Anthony--I guess Janine also knows Anthony.
JANINE: Mhmm.
AUSTIN: Um, used to live out there. And lived much closer, in fact, to another Long Island [typing] spooky thing, which was a...cult of some sort?
JACK: Oh this was a real one?
AUSTIN: Yeah.
JACK: I mean not to say that Amityville--
JANINE: The horror’s real, it’s just different.
JACK: Yeah, yeah.
AUSTIN: It’s just not, yeah...uh-huh.
ART: No, no, Amityville has been like 100% debunked. Not real.
JANINE: [cross] No it was a--
ART: [cross] Fraud perpetrated--
JANINE: It’s a murmur. A, a murder. [laughing]
AUSTIN: It’s a murmur!
JACK: Oh, the original murders were real...
JANINE: [cross] Yeah there’s a--
AUSTIN: [cross] The murders were real--
ART: [cross] The--Yeah.
AUSTIN: [cross] The ghosts are--
JANINE: [cross] --there was like a guy who killed his--yeah, yeah. He killed his siblings and parents, I think?
JACK: Yikes.
AUSTIN: That sounds right.
JANINE: So that part’s real, but the people who came in and were like, “The house is haunted!” They were lying, yes, that’s true.
AUSTIN: Right. God.
ART: Those were the people from the Conjuring movies.
KEITH: How do you ever prove that someone is lying about a haunting?
JANINE: [cross] They say they were lying about the haunting?
KEITH: [cross] Because all hauntings aren’t real, but you can only ever disprove it if you admit to lying?
AUSTIN: Yeah, that's the thing Janine--yeah, which is the thing Janine just said.
KEITH: Oh, sorry, I missed that. They admitted to lying?
JANINE: Or, it was either they admitted it, or people that they had conspired with were like, “Yeah, they were faking it, they told me to do whatever and I was like ‘I guess.’”
KEITH: Ok, right.
JANINE: Because the people were trying to, like, buy the house but then also get the money back or some shit, or, I don’t know, it was, they had some reason.
KEITH: [cross] I could tell they were lying based on that it was, they said there was a haunting?
JANINE: Well, I mean, they could believe there was a haunting--
KEITH: Sure, yeah, totally.
JANINE: Even if haunting...even if you don’t believe in haunting. It could be gas, it could be old pipes. It’s, you know. Or it could be a ghost. Like I--you could, there’s a lot of things, there’s a lot of other options to lying.
AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah, like, we had, when I moved in-- When I had, when the parish priest came to my house that we bought in fourth grade to bless it, I believe he believed he was doing a thing.
KEITH: I guess it's the, like--there’s like a movie franchise about it. And so at the point where you’ve got a business tied up with your haunted house...
AUSTIN: [cross] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
JANINE: [cross] Yeah, yeah.
AUSTIN: Totally. Definitely. That’s for sure, for sure.
JANINE: I mean, again, I believe that they believed, but also I believe that like, when my mom was like, “No, you can’t have a ouija board because I don’t want demons in the house,” even though we weren’t even like. We weren’t even like that as a family.
AUSTIN: [cross] Right. Yeah, my dad definitely believed that shit.
JACK: Uh-huh, yeah.
JANINE: But like, she wasn’t lying to me, she did believe that that would happen.
AUSTIN: Um, the group that I couldn’t remember the name of that Anthony lived like one backyard away from, um, was the...ah...God is it, is it called the International Peace Mission Movement? Uh, yes, and it was run by someone named “Father Divine.” Also, his self-given name was “Reverend Major Jealous Divine.”
JACK: Wow!
JANINE: [cross] Ohhh.
JACK: [cross] Good lord!
AUSTIN: [cross] Incredible!
KEITH: [cross] Wow.
JANINE: [cross] Wow.
AUSTIN: [cross] Mmhmm.
JANINE: I’ve never heard of that one, which is a little surprising 
AUTIN: [cross] I guess--the thing here is... I’m saying cult. He gets compared to lots of cults, but you know!
JANINE: [cross] Oh sure. It’s like a weird organization where a lot of people are just like, kind of not sure. Right?
AUSTIN: I will say that this WIkipedia thing says “Father Divine claimed to be God.” [laughing] Period. Then, he made numerous contributions to his followers’ economic independence and racial equality. You know?
JANINE: [cross] So did Jonestown...
AUSTIN: Sometimes you believe you’re God, but also--right. Yeah. But sometimes you also believe you’re God and also you help your community a bunch.
KEITH: Right, and it’s just like being haunted, where it doesn’t mean that you definitely were lying, you might just think you’re God.
JANINE: [laughing] It’s true.
AUSTIN: He believed--Yeah, uh-huh.
JACK: [reading] “Father Divine was said to be very charismatic. His sermons were emotionally moving and freely associated between topics. His speech was often peppered with words of his own invention, like--”
AUSTIN: Love it.
JACK:”--physicalating, and tangiblated. An attendee at a Harlem ‘kingdoms' meeting in the 1930s recalled that he rhythmically intoned ‘Tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions. Tens, hundreds,... millions." Although this seemed nonsense to the visitor, he reported that at the end the true believers chanted, "Yes, he's God. Yes, he's God."
AUSTIN: Love it.
KEITH: Imagine if uh, if this, if the made up words were like the Chuck Wendig tweet. If that was his sermons?
JACK: [laughing]
AUSTIN: Wait, which Chuck Wendig tweet?
KEITH: The--uh, the “fuzza wuzza”--
JACK: [cross] The, “You ever feel like flumpty-foo or--” [laughing]
AUSTIN: [cross]: Oh my god...
KEITH: [cross] [laughing] Yeah. Yeah, that!
AUSTIN: I don’t know this, I’m glad I don’t know this.
KEITH: You don’t, no, you absolutely, I swear, I--
AUSTIN: Oh, I did, I shared this a m--less than a month ago.
KEITH: Yeah yeah, I--that’s why I--I had it in my head from you, from--right.
JANINE: Yeah.
JACK: Mm.
AUSTIN. Yeah, [reading] “Wednesday. The day you flumpty-foo! [laughing] 
KEITH: [laughing in the background]
AUSTIN: And you think boopty-bop and zippity-zoom but the truth is, razza frazza wuzza wooza. What I'm trying to say is, maybe your brain isn't working either, but that's OK, because you're great. PS you need a firmware upgrade in the form of "coffee."” Quote-unquote.
JACK: Yes, he’s God. Yes, he’s God.
[laughing]
KEITH: Yeah, so, I’m glad this premise holds up, even through looking for the tweet and reading it out.
AUSTIN: Mhmm.

[Bizarre weirdly pitched ambulance siren]
[Terrible claps]
[laughing]
JANINE: That--I’m sorry, that confused me
JACK: [laughing] It confused me so much.
AUSTIN: What was that?
JACK: [laughing] I was--
ALI: That was a very pathetic ambulance, what is going--
AUSTIN: Oh, is that what that was? I guess we need to do one more, we should do one more. Five--
JACK: That was so confusing.
AUSTIN: Five seconds, five seconds.
