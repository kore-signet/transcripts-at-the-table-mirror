Ali: I think I'm good unless y'all have more you'd like to share.
Keith: No. I'm dying to talk about new character stuff, but.
Ali: [laughs] I wonder how mu— I know, I don't want...
Keith: I don't know...I agree that we shouldn't, I just want to anyway. 
Ali: [laughs] Well, I— so okay, on a scale— [pause] Let's do it this way. On a scale of one to ten, how...no, this is stupid. [laughs]
Keith: No, no. Give me the scale, I love the scale. 
Ali: I was going to say, how much do you think people are expecting what you're gonna do. Which is a stupid question 'cause it's just like, are you playing Leap? Like that's what that question is, but. [laughs]
Keith: Two? 
Ali: Oh wow, okay.
Janine: Ohhh. 
Ali: Okay.
Janine: Okay, so you're playing Fero. 
Ali: Wow.
Keith: Yeah, I'm playing Fero. Yeah. Cat's outta the bag. [Ali: Uh huh.]  Or a bird, or... [laughs]
Janine: Fero's basic— Fero's pretty Phrygian-adjacent, right? You just turn into stuff...be a guy.
Keith: [cross] Yeah, honestly, my original...until the Miscreated playbook came out, the other playbook was even more like Fero. Which is funny. [Ali: Oh.] It was actually one of my big sort of hold ups, was kind of like, this is too— it's weird, the two playbooks, I can't remember what the other one was called, unfortunately, but, they were like, they were sort of like, mmm, "Defender of the Land and you're a robot" and it was sort of like, druid themed? But then this playbook, it was not druid themed at all, it was Frankenstein themed, but the moves were much more like what Fero did, you know, action wise. So it was kind of like these weird, the two halves of Fero, the like background, almost season one feeling druid-y stuff versus the kind of terror of the deep Fero season three kind of stuff. Uh, but no, not Fero, unfortunately.
Ali: Okay. Wow. There was one...I will admit that I know one of the ideas that you were considering...
Keith: Oh, you do?
Ali: And if you... [laughs]
Keith: Does it begin with an "a?"
Ali: If you went through with it, I would have to bully you so bad, because... [laughing]
Keith: Does it begin with an "a?"
Ali: Does it begin with an "a," oh, the playbook? [Keith: Yeah.] I don't remember. [Keith: Ok, okay.] But I will...I don't want to say it into the-- unless I like bleep myself and let the audience hear your funny reaction, but there was...
Keith: That sounds like a good idea to me. 
Ali: Yeah, I'm going to do it. When you were considering playing Leap as this sort of like wealthy investor or whatever, [Keith: Yes, yeah!], I don't remember the, whatever, I was like, that's fucking Gucci. 
Keith: It's so funny.
Janine: Yeah…
Ali: [cross] It's literally Gucci. I'm going to have to make fun of you forever.
Keith: [cross] No, it's not Gucci, 'cause why—
Janine: [cross] No, it's Gucci. It’s Gucci.
Keith: It's not Gucci! Why? Why would…
Janine: It’s Gucci.
Ali: [laughing] It's Gucci.
Keith: He becomes a pirate, a rich pirate! He was— I'll tell you who he was, he was Long John Silver from Muppet Treasure Island. Covered in gold coins and— 
Janine: Do you remember Gucci's original deal? 
Keith: No.
Ali: Exactly. 
Janine: Being a rich person with a secret identity who does all the— who does like robot warfare, guerilla stuff? 
Keith: Right, right, but like Leap was a p—
Ali: Who like, play— yeah.
Keith: Leap was an anti-Gucci core member of Millenium Break, who went off to go—
Janine: And then he said "if you can't beat 'em."
Keith: —sink a bunch of Authority ships and take all their money! And then came back to— I mean, specifically, was set up to be a sort of like, uh, like a pseudo third leg of the Cause, so it would be like a—
Janine: So my question is, what it is that would...what is it about Leap's philosophy that has changed from when we saw him last, that would allow him to accumulate the wealth necessary to become this other version of himself?
Keith: Well, it's...I mean, it's not accumulation in the same way. 
Janine: [cross] If you're rich it is accumulation. 
Keith: [smiling] No, it's not, it's different!
Ali: [laughing] "It's different when I do it."
Janine: [laughing] How is it different?
Keith: Because accumulation is like...okay. 
Janine: [cross] Define in which way Leap would be rich. 
Keith: [cross] It's literally...it's not accumulation, it's amassing. It's a different thing.
Janine: Oh my god. 
Ali: [laughing hard]
Keith: It is a different thing! It's— look, I'm not going to say that this is not...that there's no...I mean, how interesting would the character be if there was zero ways for them to be compromised. Right? [Janine: Mm-hm.] I'm not saying that Leap is a saint, and everything that he does is fine—
Janine: No, of course not, of course not.
Keith: —and it's okay for him to have all this money, but like it's different if your family runs a series of factories and you're like, extorting the workers and extracting the wealth and accumulating their, you know, labor into, you know, billions of dollars in capital. That's different than like being a bank robber. Like, sure, I'm amassing wealth but whose wealth? The insurance companies who have to pay all of the ships that get— you know what I mean? It's not— it's a different thing. Amassing and accumulating is different. 
Ali: [laughs] Uh huh, yeah, fair fair fair fair. 
Keith: And then of course they come in and fund Al-Qaeda. 
Ali: [laughing] Sure. 
Janine: Uh huh.
Ali: Another Bin Laden comparison for the Cause.
Keith: Yeah. It was a fun callback.
Janine: Great. Great, great, great.
Ali: Just to put ‘em all in there. But I do think if you look at some of the moves in the playbook you were looking at especially, which was like, [Keith: Yeah.] you have this like, you can call on your, um…like associates [Keith: Yeah.] and— or, like, you can call on your lawyers to whatever, to like make some of this stuff go away, I was like, this is a fucking Gucci playbook.
Keith: Um, it is a Gucci playbook—
Janine: [cross] Yeah, you're the insurance company at that point.
Ali: [laughing]
Keith: It is a Gucci playbook, um, uh…like Gucci would work really— but you know, it's different, it's different, um…it's like different ways to color different things. I think Gucci would play this character very differently than I would as Leap. [Ali: Oh yeah.] You know what I mean?
Ali: I mean, yeah, I just— but when I saw it, I was just like, I have to make fun of Keith so bad.
Keith: And it's a way— the thing that I really wanted to do was be honest about the piracy, I didn't want Leap to just show back up and be like, "I'm done being a pirate!" [Ali: Mm-hm.] And so, I was like, okay, well, one way to do that, Austin recommended the Commander playbook. 
Janine: Yeah, that makes sense. 
Keith: But Austin recommended my last playbook, so I didn't want to do what Austin said. [laughs]
Janine: Oh. I see.
Ali: [laughs]
Keith: Um, and had the bad luck of recommending that before I had the chance to read the playbook, so Commander was basically out. Brigadier was similar, but Brigadier just didn't feel right, and there was a couple moves that like, were half wasted 'cause they give you crew bonuses, but we already have max crew. 
Ali and Janine: Mmm.
Keith: So I was like, well, I don't want to waste these moves to get the good half when the other half is like, won't do anything. And then I was like, well…I just had this image— have you both seen Muppet Treasure Island? 
Ali: I haven't, unfortunately.
Janine: Yeah.
Keith: Oh my god, so, so Tim Curry as—
Janine: The cook, right?
Keith: As Long John Silver in that movie, he's covered in red and black cloaks and feathered caps and he's covered in gold and jewelry and he's so charismatic and fun, and I was like that's Leap. Leap comes back having been the most successful pirate in…of all time.
Ali: [laughs]
Janine: Yeah, but he could be that at any class, he could be a rich— like he could be wearing opulent stuff, he doesn't have to be a lawyer—
Keith: Well, the thing that—
Janine: —to be that. 
Keith: —the thing that I like about the Commander class was that it gives you a cr— and Brigadier also, it gives you a crew? So it was like, oh, this has Leap's pirate crew like built into it? And Almoner also has stuff like that, where it's like, oh, you have like, [Ali: Mm.] you have your guys that do your—
Ali: Sort of like I have my guys. 
Keith: Right, yeah yeah yeah, sort of like how you have your guys. So I wanted a class that like gave me a crew, and Almoner was the only other one like that? I just think it's so funny. [Ali: laughs] I just think it's so funny. My other idea was like, in the same way that Leap sort of shrugged— this is like leaning, my instinct was to be true to the pirate thing? [Ali: Mm-hm.] And then, so I was like, well, what happens if I did the exact opposite and I leaned super far away from being true to the pirate thing. And so I was like, in the same way that Leap shrugged his shoulders and was like, "I'm going to go off and be a pirate now. Fuck you all." [Ali: Mm-hm.] Shrugged his shoulders and was like, "I'm done being a pirate, I'm going to be some other thing now." And you can bleep this, Ali, I'm going to be a Private Eye.
Ali: Sure. [laughs]
Keith: 'Cause there's a detective playbook called Investigator, and right now— this is for you two, not for the show— [Ali: Uh huh.] now it is basically maybe pirate Leap comes back season three and I'm doing like, a Leap crew member for season two who gets sent back to investigate something [Ali: Mm-hm.] on Leap's behalf? Or it's Leap, doing the bit of, "hey, now I'm going to be a detective, I already did—" [laughs] "I already did pirate, I already did freedom fighter, now I'm doing noir detective." [laughs]
Ali: Yeah, I mean, people change careers throughout their life.
Janine: [laughs]
Keith: Yeah, I'm the guy that can't hold down a job, um, but the jobs are terrorist, pirate…[laughs]
Janine: [cross] The average space pirate will have twenty jobs in his lifetime. 
Keith and Ali [laugh]
Janine: This is just a fact of the modern economy.
Keith: Yeah, yeah.
Ali: Well, you know, you break out of prison, you, um, start a revolution, you're in a very specific stage in your life, [Keith: Yeah.] and then you just want to settle down and have like a job, you know.
Keith: Right, yeah. As a private dick. 
Janine: You put all your pirate money in a Roth IRA and then...
Ali and Keith [laugh]
Keith: See, that's Gucci to me, that's way more Gucci.
