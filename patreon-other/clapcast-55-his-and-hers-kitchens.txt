AUSTIN: Ah, it’s Bitcoin’s birthday today!


[ALI sighs]


JACK: Oooh!


ART: Ooh my god!


AUSTIN: Thanks, Time.is. Thank you…


ALI: Wait…


AUSTIN: …for that one.


ALI: …time.is told you that one? Wait.


AUSTIN: Uhum.


ART: Yes.


AUSTIN: Aha.


ART: That’s the holiday today.


JANINE: Oh my g—


ART: Bitcoin’s birthday. 


JANINE: That— [annoyed] Aaa! 


AUSTIN: We’ve gotta…


JANINE: That’s not a holiday! [overlapping] Gross.


AUSTIN: [overlapping] It’s time to give up on Time.is. I think we’ve gotta find a new one.


ALI: Time.gov?


AUSTIN: Time.gov…


ART: It’s a real… And the quote today: “We only have a little time to please the living, but all of eternity to love the dead.”


[AUSTIN chuckles]


ART: Sort of feels like a Bitcoin’s birthday kind of quote, if you…


[ALI & JACK laugh]


AUSTIN: It sure does.


ART: …if you really…  


AUSTIN: Damn.


ART: …drill it down to the worst of it.


ALI: [quietly] Yeah.


AUSTIN: Damn.


ALI: [quietly] Yeah.


AUSTIN: Also, it’s probably the thing that Sophocles said. Right? That’s a thing a character of Sophocles said? So I don’t know if I believe it.


JANINE: Or a translator of a character of Sophocles?


AUSTIN: Sure!


ALI: Oh, yea-yea-yeah.


AUSTIN: You know what I mean, right?


JACK: It is Antigone, I think. [??? “It is in Antigone”? – 0:52]


AUSTIN: Okay, sure. Yeah.


ART: Um. Yeah.


AUSTIN: [overlapping] I’m supposed to believe that Antigone says? [??? -0:56]


ART: [overlapping] Yeah, it’s—


AUSTIN: Come on.


[ALI & JACK laugh, AUSTIN scoffs]


ART: No, I think…


JANINE: We’re just a generation away from being bro.


ART: …as…


[AUSTIN laughs]


ART: …as a creative person…


AUSTIN: Aha.


ART: And I think we’re all creative people. We have to agree that we personally endorse everything…


AUSTIN: Everything…! [chuckles]


JACK: Oooh!


[everybody agrees]


ART: …that one of our characters has ever said!


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: Aha, yeah.


JANINE: Oh, yeah!


AUSTIN: Uhum!


ALI: Yeah. Interesting… 


ART: [adversarially] Anything I’ve said on this show, quote me when I’m dead with that! That’s what I say!


AUSTIN: Art Tebbel said: “Of course the wind can be evil”


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: [further from his microphone] Art Martinez-Tebbel! Put it on a…


ART: Aha. 


AUSTIN: [still off, overlapping] The thing…


ART: [overlapping] Put that on an epigraph, for me.


AUSTIN: [still off] Aha.


JANINE: True and true every year, actually.


AUSTIN: [chuckles] Aha.


ALI: Yeah. [flippantly] I mean, it’s kinda windy. I think the wind can be evil.


AUSTIN: Oh my god.


JACK: Anything could be evil!


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: [sighs] Okay.


ALI:  [laughs] Oh, but bread? Bread cannot be evil or lucky. We’ve— These are— [laughs]


JACK: No, aha.


ALI: These are the determinations we’ve made on this show.


AUSTIN: God.


ART: I watched a great youtube-video where these people reviewed a toaster that cost £300.


ALI: Suuure.


JANINE: Of what? 


AUSTIN: Did they like it?


ART: Made by Mitsubishi.


[ALI chuckles]


ART: And it only toasts one piece of bread at a time.


ALI: No fucking way!


[JANINE laughs]


ART: They loved it.


JANINE: [revulsed] Uuuuugh!


ALI: Why?


ART: [chuckling] ‘Cause it made really good toast…


AUSTIN: No it didn’t.


ALI: But toast doesn’t hold temperature like that! [overlapping] You can’t just make one at a time!


JACK: [overlapping] Oh my god!


AUSTIN: These are people who’re eating one piece of toast.


ART: [overlapping] Yeah, this is…


JACK: [overlapping] It’s called a bread oven, and it does not look how you think it looks!


ART: Well, I’ve seen it. [chuckles]


AUSTIN: Mitsubishi bread oven.


ALI: [cynically] Oooah! Sure! [laughs]


AUSTIN: Okay… okay.


ALI: Why not?


AUSTIN: Okay.


ALI: [agitated] You could’ve made that just wider!


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: Oh, this is pretty, actually. [overlapping] It’s [??? – 02:38] but it’s pretty.


JACK: [overlapping] I don’t know, here’s the thing…


AUSTIN: [subdued, overlapping] Oh my god…


JACK: I have a scheme now!


AUSTIN: [subdued] I can’t believe I’m gonna buy one of these.


JACK: Which is…


JANINE: It actually looks like a humidifier.


[ALI scoffs]


JACK: …what if the four of us buy this for Ali, and then it’s the greatest thing that she owns?


AUSTIN: Ooooo! [chuckles]


ALI: [laughs] I do live alone! This would be fine for me!


AUSTIN: Yeah…


ALI: But…


ART: I think you need that fluffy kind of Japanese kind of bread for it, but…


AUSTIN: [agreeing] That bread…! Yeah.


JACK: If anybody can source it…


ALI: [laughs] Chinese baker here sells that bread.


AUSTIN: Uuu.


ALI: Shaped like a cat. So, you know. It’s my birthday, so. [chuckles]


AUSTIN: Oh, wait! There’s a competing…!


ART: You can get it in America. Jack gave us a… Amazon.co.uk and Americans get only $340, which is I think cheaper than £300.


ALI: [quietly] Wow!


AUSTIN: Yeah. We—


ART: “Only ten left, in stock, order soon!”


[ALI chuckles]


JACK: We gotta get this for Ali!


AUSTIN: “‘We wanted to focus on the single slice, and treat it with respect,’ said Akihiro Iwahara, who is in charge of technical development at Mitsubishi Electric’s home-appliances division. ‘Our technology and know-how from rice cookers helped us come up with a way to trap and seal moisture.’” Interesting. 


JACK: Interesting! ‘Cause toast is very dry!


ART: They said— they mentioned that on youtube, yeah. 


[ALI chuckles]


AUSTIN: Yeah. “‘There’s nothing more enchanting than the perfect slice of toast’ says Kaori Kajita, founder of Japan Butter Toast Association”


[ART laughs]


AUSTIN: Which sounds half fake…


JANINE: God…


AUSTIN: …but actually exists. Quote: “You can’t help but be elated.” Yeah. Okay. Yeah. A perfect slice of bread.


ART: Look at all these buttons!


JANINE: Do you think…


ALI: I love buttons, yeah.


JANINE: Do you think that association has, like, membership dues?


AUSTIN: Probably.


JANINE: Like, pay a due to get in there?


ALI: I hope so.


AUSTIN: You gotta make the perfect slice of bread. Of toast.


JACK: I…


ART: They send you like a card? Like a card for your wallet?


AUSTIN: Mm. Uhum, uhum.


ART: [overlapping] To get in all the toast clubs?


JANINE: [overlapping] It’s just a shade of brown that you like your toast.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: Like a [??? – 4:22] card.


AUSTIN: You can’t—


JANINE: And you hand it out at restaurants and be like: “make my toast this!”


AUSTIN: Uhm…


JACK: I’m putting an image in the Bluff City chat that—


[ALI chuckles]


JACK: I love this image for so many reasons. I love that it’s low resolution. I love the fact that every bit of this image [chuckles] just feels soft. I love the way— The thing on the top looks like a little button. And I love the presentation of the toast. Here you go.


ALI: Sure. Yeah. Yea-yeah.


AUSTIN: Oh, Bluff.


[ALI laughs]


ART: This is a before photo though, right?


ALI: [laughing] Yes.


AUSTIN: Yes. That’s a before photo. [overlapping] Yeah, for sure.


JANINE: [overlapping] This also highlights, like: yes, it’s for one slice of bread, but they’re intending it to be a thick slice—


AUSTIN: That’s a thick slice.


ALI: Uhum.


JACK: Yup.


JANINE: They’ve—


JACK: Uhum.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: There’s room there for the volume.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: And then you put your stuff on top, and it’s… You know…


AUSTIN: Yes.


JANINE: It’s nice…


AUSTIN: Or, it could handle cheese or an egg on top.


JACK: Whoa!


AUSTIN: And you could do french toast with it.


JACK: Whoa!


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Also, they say explicitly— They say: “given Japanese taste, there are a lot of people who are looking for a refined and delicate experience. We’re not asking customers to get rid of their toasters, but to enjoy this as an entirely different category.”


ALI: Woow!


AUSTIN: “You can’t go back to a regular toaster…”


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: …said Masahiko Shoji, who’s a university lecturer, who says he eats more bread since buying a Balmuda. Which is another company that makes these.


JANINE: Okay, counterpoint: what if you had the worst toast?


[AUSTIN chuckles]


ALI: Aha.


JANINE: That’s raw in most parts…


AUSTIN: Oh my god.


[JACK laughs]


JANINE: …and burnt in this shape of a…


JACK: [laughing] No!


ALI: It’s…


JANINE: What the fuck’s that character’s name? Domo-kun? 


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Is that Domo-kun? Yeah. Great. Love it.


JANINE: Just, like, it’s extremely burnt and…


AUSTIN: It’s very funny.


JANINE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: It’s very funny.


ART: What? That is what they say about this toast! The bread is still raw in the middle.


ALI: Oh, yea-yea-yeah!


AUSTIN: Oooh!


ART: That it’s toast on the outside, inside it’s…


[JANINE laughs]


JACK: I bet it’s great, though!


AUSTIN: I dunno. You’re loosing me.


JANINE: Bread’s already been cooked. It’s not raw in the middle… [laugh]


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: It’s raw in the middle…


ALI: It’s just soft. It’s like eating like a bagel, but it’s a slice instead. You know what I mean. Like there’s difference…


AUSTIN: Yeaaah. I’d try it.


ALI: [overlapping] …there’s a gradient…


JANINE: [overlapping] Also, like, you can just turn down your toaster if that’s what you want.


ALI: Well. Uhm. [laughs]


JANINE: If you want it soft in the middle.


AUSTIN: Oouh! But wait, look at this!


JACK: I don’t—


AUSTIN: Look at this flatbread! Oh, you can do flatbreads! A little focaccia situation! I can’t take— Let me just take a screenshot. Because you can’t…


JACK: This picture is too high resolution.


AUSTIN: It’s too high resolution. Amazon won’t let me. You do a little focaccia in there!


JACK: Oooh!


AUSTIN: With some sun-dried tomatoes and some other stuff…


ALI: [overlapping] Oh, look at that!


JANINE: [overlapping] Oh, I thought this is… I thought this was gonna be, like, you could cook it from start to finish in there. Of course not.


AUSTIN: Noo.


JANINE: It’s reheating it, I guess? Right?


AUSTIN: I don’t know. Maybe.


JANINE: I think you’re reheating it.


AUSTIN: Probably.


ALI: Wow.


AUSTIN: Still good!


ALI: Imagine having this and resle— [chuckles] reheating a Sicilian slice of pizza.


AUSTIN: Ohh!


JACK: Ooh!


ALI: Yes baby!


JANINE: [overlapping] Oh, I found a…


AUSTIN: [overlapping] I’d buy this and I’m gonna get some Ellio’s to put in there.


[ALI, ART & JACK laugh]


JANINE: This is how they’re doing the egg!


ALI: I think that’d be so good! 


AUSTIN: Aaah! Look at the egg!


JANINE: An asparagus border. To keep the egg in.


AUSTIN: Yeah, sure.


JANINE: And then you put the egg in the middle.


ALI: Oh, yeah. Okay, yeah.


AUSTIN: [overlapping] Oh, so Jack and…


JANINE: [overlapping] I’m not sure how I feel about an asparagus toast, but…


AUSTIN: Aha. For Jack and Janine: Ellio’s pizza is like… a flat, like, rectangle pizza that — I think I told you this, Janine — like, it predated, like, Bagel Bites as like…


ALI: Aha.


JANINE: [overlapping] Oh yes, this did come up.


AUSTIN: [overlapping] The sort of like— you come home from school and you get a… Ellio’s slice of pizza.


ALI: Oh, yea-yeah.


JACK: Oh, yeah! I’m looking at one of these. Aah, I bet this machine would…


AUSTIN: I would be…


JACK: …make those so good!


AUSTIN: It’d be so good! It’d be so good!


ALI: It would be really good.


JACK: How…


JANINE: [overlapping] I have— 


JACK: [overlapping] What do you think—


JANINE: I have some slightly different brand version— I have the Dr. Oetker, I think, equivalent of these in my freezer right now.


AUSTIN: [chuckles warmly] Aaaah!


JACK: What would happen if you—


ALI: Ellio’s is such a…


JACK: …put a Pop Tart in there?


AUSTIN: It’s such a thing. [sighs] See, I think I have to draw the line at Ellio’s, because… I have Pop Tarts in this room as a backup thing. As, like, a “hey do you want a snack? I’ve got a Pop Tart.” I’m not dissing Pop Tarts. But I don’t think Pop Tarts deserve the $300 toaster. [overlapping] Ellio’s does, for some reason, in my bread. In my head. [laughs] In my bread!


ART: [overlapping] Well, I mean, it doesn’t do what you want, though. Right? ‘Cause you want the filling…


[JACK laughs]


ART: The filling of a Pop Tart, you want it to be warm.


AUSTIN: Yes! Yes!


JACK: Oh, yeah. Right!


AUSTIN: True.


JACK: Right, right, right. It is so much thinner than the bread, though! So it might just get warm!


AUSTIN: It might get warm!


ART: Hmm…!


ALI: I think so, yeah.


AUSTIN: You might be right. If we do another live show ever in our lives…


[ALI chuckles]


AUSTIN: We should get one of these to bring to it.


JACK: I do want one of these!


AUSTIN: How long does it take to toast one piece of bread?


JACK: [laughing] 48 hours!


AUSTIN: I bet we could…


JANINE: [uncertainly] 3 minutes.


ART: It’s not quick!


ALI: 40 minutes? 40 seconds! [laughs]


JANINE: What!?


AUSTIN: [chuckling] 40 minutes! The perfect piece of toast!


ART: [overlapping] No, they were… 


JANINE: [overlapping] In the sun, sure!


ART: …on the video they mentioned that it took a while.


AUSTIN: Hm.


ALI: Oh!


ART: ‘Cause it’s— They’re doing it right.


AUSTIN: GenCon probably wouldn’t let us feed people either, huh? 


ALI: [softly] No.


JACK: No.


AUSTIN: [overlapping] Because you see where I’m going?


JANINE: [overlapping] Not if one’s gonna take that long! [??? – 09:08]


ART: [overlapping, unintelligible] gonna run GenCon again. [???]


AUSTIN: You see what I’m sayin’, right? We could have a little stand set up, where people have their single toast bread. 


ALI: Sure.


AUSTIN: Single piece of toasted bread. And then, like, throughout the show they would just get in line and just get them. While we’re doing, I don’t know…


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: [overlapping] …deeply moving roleplay.


JANINE: [overlapping] There’s easier ways to write off that toaster. [laughs]


ART: [overlapping] We’re really making an Andy Kaufmann show at this point.


[ALI laughs]


ART: We’re taking the audience out for milk and cookies at this point.


AUSTIN: Yeah. It’s great!


[JANINE chuckles]


ALI: You’d have like a condiment set. Like, you put, like… butter and cinnamon! Or you could, like, crack an egg on your toast…


AUSTIN: [under his breath] This is what I’m sayin’!


ALI: …or get some slices of cheese…!


AUSTIN: They’d ban us.


ART: [overlapping] Yeah.


JACK: [overlapping, unintelligible] …makes the money back, right? [??? – 09:46]


AUSTIN: [overlapping] It might be worth…


[short pause]


ART: [overlapping] We’re basically running a bed and breakfast at that point.


AUSTIN: [overlapping] Oh, this is gonna give it away at this point, Jack.


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: I don’t— You know what it is like. A few loaves of bread, one— You know. Come on!


ALI: We would just have to be their, like… their restaurant area. [laughs]


AUSTIN: Right. Yes.


JACK: Aha.


ALI: [chuckling] We would do an outdoor show, obviously.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Yeah. Aha.


ALI: Out in the restaurant. [laughs] And you can…


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ALI: We’d be right next to the meat cart. [??? – 10:12] [overlapping] And [chuckling] fucking come through!


AUSTIN: [overlapping] Right! I forgot about the meat cart. 


[JACK chuckles]


AUSTIN: Anyway, we should Time.is. I’ve open and closed Time.is like thirty times since…


JANINE: I think the real… My last thought on toasters is that… the amount of mo— I’m underestimating the amount of money that I personally would pay…


AUSTIN: Hm…


JANINE: …for something that is a good toaster, but also doesn’t have the word SMEG on it.


[AUSTIN chuckles]


JACK: [uncomfortably] Um!


AUSTIN: You know, fair!


ALI: Sure!


AUSTIN: Fair!


JACK: Yeah.


ALI: Yeah.


ART: You’re… you’re having troubles with the SMEGs.


ALI: I hate it.


AUSTIN [chuckles tiredly] Yeah.


JANINE: I would like a nice, high-quality toaster, but man, that’s a name! That’s a name! And it’s got on. It’s right there.


AUSTIN: Wait, is that what’s it called? Is that what it’s called?


JACK: [overlapping] It is what it’s called.


ART: [overlapping] It’s a brand, yeah.


JANINE: [overlapping] Yeah.


ART: Yeah.


JANINE: Yeah. [overlapping] 


AUSTIN: [tentatively] Oooh!


JANINE: It’s on… 


ALI: And it’s on everything.


JANINE: Oh yeah.


ALI: Like, they really make you know that that’s who made it. [laughs]


ART: They make fridges, too.


ALI: Aha.


ART: Same deal.


AUSTIN: And pizza stones, apparently.


ART: Welly, that’s in your oven at least.


[JANINE chuckles]


AUSTIN: You don’t have to see that.


ART: You don’t have to see that. No-one comes to your house like: [overlapping] “hey, what’s going on with your fridge?”


JANINE: [overlapping] “Damn you’ve got a pizza on that SMEG?”


[JACK laughs]


AUSTIN: [chuckling] Okay.


JACK: No! Time.is!


AUSTIN: I’m gonna go to the bathroom and throw up. I’ll be back in…


[everyone laughs]


ALI: [quietly]  See ya!


AUSTIN: I will, like— Hopefully, Ali’s radiator will stop fighting… [laughs]


[JANINE chuckles]


AUSTIN: …by the time I’m back. I’ll be right back.


JANINE: That’s scary.


JACK: I got— I got the little internet thing going where I… the call drops out. But it drops out every 4 minutes or so. So I think I’ll be fine.


JANINE: Mmkay.


JACK: But for, like, ten seconds. So unless I’m the one speaking, it’ll be fine.


ALI: I want one of these toast holders! But again, you’ve— That’s not— I don’t wanna eat cold toast!


JACK: Oh.


JANINE: What’s a toast holder?


ALI: In the latest SMEG [laughs] publication that I’ve just posted.


JACK: Don’t… [overlapping] keep saying it!


ALI: [overlapping, laughing] Which shows their whole range! SMEG front and center! There’s, like, a toast holder. Which I get. But also, like, that’s not how you’re experiencing toast!


JANINE: Ooh! That— Man! I feel like I’ve only seen those in, like, British period dramas.


ALI: Yeah.


JACK: Yeah, we call them toast racks! [snickers]


[JANINE chuckles]


ALI: [intrigued] Uohh!


ART: Ooh!


JACK: And I…


JANINE: The servants bring that up for the family.


[ALI chuckles]


JACK: Yeah, exactly. With the… boiled egg. The eggs and soldiers. I quite like cold toast in very certain circumstances: it depends what I’m putting on the toast.


JANINE: [under her breath, overlapping] That’s a good kettle


JACK: [overlapping] If I want something melty.


JANINE: Yeah?


JACK: The thing is: other than the name, all of these are really nice. Ahh…


JANINE: Yeaahh… [overlapping] That kettle looks so good to me.


JACK: You should just go in with a chisel… and take it off. And some plaster of whatever. [chuckling] Fill in the holes.


JANINE: [half-chuckling] Yeah, plaster. That’s how you patch up appliances.


JACK: Yeah, right?


JANINE: Yeah.


JACK: [irreverently] Appliance plaster?


JANINE: Hm… Appliance plaster.


JACK: Yeah. [half-chuckling] Gorilla Glue.


JANINE: [laughs] God, that tiny little rolling pin! [chuckling] What is that even… What do you roll out with that tiny little rolling pin? That’s… like… barely as wide as two eggs!


JACK: Did you see the — I’m gonna have to say the product’s name again — did you see the SMEG collaborations with Dolce & Gabbana?


[ALI laughs]


ART: I did!


JANINE: What?!


ART: I’ve seen that in person!


JACK: They are, honestly, amazing! Um. Let me just drop a Google… [overlapping] I’m just gonna drop a Google image search link here.


JANINE: [overlapping] I’m googling SMEG Dolce. Oh these are— Okay, this is not what I was looking for at all! 


ART: No! They’re not what you expect at all!


JANINE: These are so mu— [revulsed] God! This… oven! I would love to just meet whoever these are for. I understand the small ones. But like the big ones?


JACK: Yeah. Aha. 


JANINE: Oh, this is…


JACK: God, the fridges are wild!


JANINE: I found a really good pic. This is like— Someone’s like… This is like a render done in, like, DAZ 3D or some shit, and it’s very funny. [chuckles] But… 


JACK: [laughing] Oh my god…


JANINE: [chuckling] …I think this is the vision.


JACK: Oh, Janine, you know how I know that’s a render does— done in DAZ 3D? [overlapping] Because of this image.


JANINE: [overlapping] The tablecloth?


JACK:  No.


JANINE: Aah! Yeah.


[ART laughs]


ALI: [laughing] Aww.


JANINE: That’s… that’s just what that room looks like. [chuckles]


ALI: Yeah.


JACK: [half-chuckling] “Oh, this is my fridge and oven room.”


[ART chuckles]


JANINE: Yeah.


ALI: Well, it’s his and hers kitchens!


JACK: Oh, his and hers kitchens! Right!


[ALI laughs]


JANINE: Yeah!


ALI: “I want my stove, with my refrigerator for my things…


[JACK chuckles]


ALI: [overlapping] …and you have to go over there!”


JANINE: [overlapping] My loose fruit.


JACK: “To the other side of our door!”


[ALI laughs]


JACK: “We’re living in a set from Succession!”


[JANINE laughs]


ALI: I’ve been watching that, and…


ART: I think that’s the target audience, yes.


[ALI laughs]


JANINE: Sure, yeah.


JACK: The Roy family?


ART: Yeah. And equivalents.


JACK: Yeah. Aha.


JANINE: Eccentric children of billionaires.


JACK: Yeah.


ART: When we went to buy new pots and pans, the store had, like, one of these… toasters or whatever. And it was on clearance, ‘cause no-one wanted it! [laughs]


[JACK laughs]


JANINE: Yeah, you gotta design a room around that shit! Like, it’s so much!


JACK: No! I would not design a room around it! 


[ART chuckles]


JACK: And I would have it sit on my kitchen surface as a malevolent entity. It would [chuckles] just be like a weird evil object.


JANINE: [overlapping] Some of these are also just so…


ART: [overlapping] You’d get the one that least looked like it belonged in your kitchen.


JACK: [half-chuckling] Yes!


JANINE: I think this is like an electric orange juicer?


JACK: Yes, it is! [overlapping] That’s what it looks like!


JANINE: [overlapping] Like, it’s so specific!


[a brief pause]


JANINE: [overlapping] And you just have that at…


ART: [overlapping] You know what’s not that hard? It’s squeezing juice out of an orange.


ALI: [agreeing] Hmm.


JANINE: Yeah, I’d like…


JACK: I don’t like to do it!


JANINE: There’s so many— There’s so many different kinds of juicer in the world, I didn’t know people were still in for this kind.


JACK: Oh, this juicer is 500 British pounds!


JANINE: Yeah.


ART: Wow!


JANINE: I looked at the kettle and was: “aah, I see, okay” [chuckles]


[ALI laughs]


ART: But I’m telling you, go to your kit— your local Williams & Elmann, [??? I’m not American – 15:48] you might find some of these on clearance, and get: no-one wanted them.


ALI: Oh, yea-yea-yeah.


JANINE: I don’t think any of those exist in Canada or England?


ART: Oh.


JACK: No, we don’t have Williams & Elmann [???]


ART: And maybe it’s— Maybe it’s over. Maybe the clearance phase is over, and now they’re collectibles. But…


JANINE: Yeah…


JACK: [overlapping] Oh, shit!


ART: [overlapping] There’s really a window, where I think, especially, like, the shitty little things you could have gotten for a bargain.


JANINE: Also, I checked…


ART: This is—


JANINE: We have Williams Sonoma in Canada; all of these things are $1000 or up in Canada dollars. [chuckling]


[ALI laughs]


JACK: Hmm…


JANINE: So: no thank you! [chuckles]


JACK: Hm, uhum.


ART: I don’t know what it cost. I just know it was on clearance. So I guess, they didn’t— it was just in the clearance section. It could have been on clearance for $800, for all I know.


JACK: Yeah, [overlapping] I’m on the Williams Sonoma website.


JANINE: [overlapping] These are made to order.


JACK: What!?


ART: Ah… Hm.


JANINE: They’re made to order. That’s what they’re saying about this toaster, anyway.


[a brief pause]


ART: I…


[JACK laughs in disbelief]


ART: I still contend I saw something from this collection in a clearance store.


JANINE: I guess, if someone has returned it or something.


ART: Sure.


JACK: [overlapping] They…


JANINE: [overlapping] Or they had display models and… Yeah.


JACK: I went to the William Sonoma website, and they just explicitly told me that because I’m in England, [chuckling] I’m not allowed to go to the website.


ALI: Oooh!


ART: [in disbelief] You can’t go to the website?!


JACK: Yeah, it’s due to GDPR, which is like…


JANINE: [nonchalantly] Illegal.


ALI: Oh my god. [laughs]


JACK: …European data protection laws. Williams Sonoma has not updated their data protection page. It says: “If you reside in the UK, you can continue to order from our UK locations and partners.” Which is interesting. “Visit West Elm & Pottery Barn Kids at potterbarnkids.co.uk.”


[JANINE chuckles]


ALI: Oh, sure, yeah.


JACK: [overlapping] Yeah, I’m now on Pottery Barn Kids.


JANINE: [overlapping] Going to Pottery Barn kids to order my Dol— my SMEG Dolce & Gabbana two-slice toaster…


[ALI chuckles]


JANINE: …with backlit chrome knob! It has a backlit knob! That’s the…


[ALI snickers]


ART: Ooh.


JANINE: That’s where the money is going!


ALI: Yeah.


ART: Finally!


ALI: These are the details people pay for!


JACK: [chuckling] Not at William Sonoma in Los Angeles.


ART: A £1000 juicer is… really audacious.


[a brief pause]


JANINE: I mean, you say that, but then you try it and you’ll never go back to anything else that has a— has darkened knobs or buttons again.


ALI: Um, well they have some steals on their website, ‘cause you can get the ceramic pheasant vase for… $35 from 90.


ART: Wow!


JACK: Is it good?


ALI: I… I like the look of it. [laughs]


JACK: Oh!


ART: Oh!


JANINE: That’s cute! I don’t hate that.


ALI: Yeah!


ART: It is what it says it is.


ALI: Aha.


ART: That’s a ceramic pheasant.


JACK: I would—


JANINE: I don’t know how it counts as a vase…? Do you put like a…


ALI: [overlapping] Aah, me neither.


JANINE: [overlapping] How would flowers sit in there?


ART: [unintelligible] [??? – 18:25]


JANINE: …ornament. [???]


JACK: You put one really decadent egg in.


JANINE: [overlapping] I kind—


ALI: [overlapping] It should be, like, a gravy bowl. Like, with this design.


JANINE: I was going to say, I kinda wish this was a teapot.


ALI: [overlapping] Oooh! Yeah.


JANINE: [overlapping] You, like, grab by the tail, and…


ALI: Yeah.


JANINE: That’d be cool.


JACK: I would invariably accidentally break the tail off. Um, somehow.


[ALI chuckles]


JANINE: Yeah…


AUSTIN: Hello, I’m back.


ALI: [overlapping] Well, hello!


JANINE: [overlapping] Hi!


JACK: [overlapping] Hello, Austin!


ART: Hi!


AUSTIN: Uhmm…


ART: We did great work while you were away.


[ALI & JANINE chuckle]


AUSTIN: Thank you. [overlapping] I appreciate it.


ART: [overlapping] I’m really proud of us.


[ALI chuckles]


JACK: [overlapping] Looking at the juicers [??? – 18:55]


JANINE: [chuckling, overlapping] Don’t ask any questions about these things.


AUSTIN: These are all nice.


[ALI, JANINE & JACK laugh]


JANINE: No, way!


AUSTIN: Some of them are a lot. Some of them are kind of a lot. Increasingly: a lot.


[everyone but AUSTIN is laughing]


AUSTIN: That’s so— You have to see [??? – 19:051] I started with the nice turquoise and cream-colored ones, and then…


ALI: Yeah.


ART: And then got the Dolce & Gabbana collection.


AUSTIN: Yeah…


ALI: Yeah…


[JANINE chuckles]


AUSTIN: Yeah…


JANINE: [laughs, unintelligible] [??? – 19:17]


ART: Just click on that link to the juicer to see what it costs!


JACK: Wait, before you do: guess how much that costs and then click the link.


AUSTIN: I’ve already guessed in my mind: it was $800. And it’s somehow more than that. So…


JACK: Aha.


ART: It’s a lot more than that, is the real thing. It’s…


AUSTIN: Aa… No, thank you.


[0:19:32] Second segment


JANINE: It’s a real shame that the advent of, like, everyone has their smartphone on them at all times…


AUSTIN: Uhum…


JANINE: …really killed, like… the sitcom joke about someone being sick and having a little bell.


ALI: Uhum.


AUSTIN: Oh…


JACK: Yeah, yeah.


AUSTIN: Right, sure.


JACK: We could still do the little bell!


AUSTIN: Yeah, they still make little bells!


JACK: [overlapping] I can even get—


ALI: [overlapping] You could set your text tone specifically to a little bell noise! [laughs]


[ART laughs]


JACK: [overlapping] Someone going [??? – 20:02]


AUSTIN: [overlapping] Aah, that’s cute, yeah.


ART: That sounds like a good app.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ALI: Aha! [laughs]


ART: Um…


AUSTIN: [half-chuckling] Y’all wanna be millionaires real quick?


[ALI laughs]


ART: Yeah.


JACK: Uhum.


ART: When I…


JANINE: [mumbles unintelligibly]


ART: …fucked up my knee really bad when I was 16, we didn’t have a little bell. And it was pre… cellular telephones, really.


AUSTIN: Right.


ART: I mean, the cell phone existed, but…


AUSTIN: Yeah, I know what you mean.


ART: Uhm, neither of my parents had one, for example.


AUSTIN: Right.


ART: Back when that was a thing that could happen. And so, what they got for me, we— somehow we got an… a flashlight that had an alarm.


[JANINE & AUSTIN chuckle]


JACK: [chuckling] What?


ART: Which was, I’m sure was some sort of like…


AUSTIN: That’s very funny.


JANINE: That’s like a— [overlapping]  that’s like a crime thing, yeah.


ART: [overlapping] …safety thing. Yeah.


JANINE: For preventing crimes. An attack light? [??? – 20:46]


ART: I think it might have been probably for the woods…?


JANINE & AUSTIN: [simultaneously] Oh, sure!


ART: [??? – 20:53] Yeah, it’s my bear— [chuckling] It’s my someone—  either “help me, a bear is attacking me” or “a bear is attacking me, save yourself!”


[JANINE & JACK laugh]


AUSTIN: Aah… That’s so funny.


ART: But it was just, like, the most annoying siren…


AUSTIN: Uh…


ART: But it was just what we had. And I couldn’t get up. So…


[AUSTIN snickers]


ART: It’s what we did.


AUSTIN: That’s what you do.


JANINE: Gotta make do.


AUSTIN: Yeah, exactly.


JACK: Yeah. These pre-phone days…


ART: Yeah.


JACK: Of course, I was born in 2006, when the cell phone had been— [chuckles]


[ART laughs]


AUSTIN: [half-chuckling] Don’t joke…


[JANINE laughs]


JACK: [chuckling] This is not true.


AUSTIN: You’re a baby, but not that baby. You’re not that…


ART: It was rough making those first couple seasons, when you were…


[AUSTIN laughs]


ART:  …7.


[ALI, JANINE & JACK laugh]


AUSTIN: [laughing] Incredibly talented, honestly!


JACK: Oh, wow! [overlapping] A wild show!


ART: [overlapping] Yeah, a prodigy!


AUSTIN: Yeah. Aha. You wrote all the music? Jesus!


[JANINE laughs]


ART: Yeah, uhm…


JACK: Frankly, I plateaued.


[AUSTIN laughs]


ART: That’s why we didn’t incorporate for those first few years…


JACK: Oh, right! [overlapping] Because of child labor laws.


ART: [overlapping] …because then it would be a child labor issue, yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: Yeah.
