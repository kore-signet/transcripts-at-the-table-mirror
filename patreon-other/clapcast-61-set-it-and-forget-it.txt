Clapcast 61: Set It and Forget It
Transcriber: Brigid @woodlandmists/brighty#2727


AUSTIN: One, two, three, four, five… Welcome to Friends at the Table, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.  Yeah, okay.  Still a little quiet, but…


DRE: Which wristwatch is the Swiss wristwatch?


AUSTIN: [impressed] Oh!  Look at that.


DRE: Listen, I did improv in college, I learned some stuff.


AUSTIN: Apparently!  [Dre chuckles]  All right, let me get you…  Oh, do y’all have the… Do y’all even have the Road to Palisade link?


SYLVIA: To the Roll20?  I don’t think so.


AUSTIN: Yeah, it’s in there somewhere.


DRE: [crosstalk] I do.


AUSTIN: Do you?  Uhhh…


SYLVIA: Maybe I do.  Hold on, I might have clicked on it.  I get a lot of links in this chat.


AUSTIN: I got it for you.


[pause, some giggles and chuckles]


SYLVIA: It’s true!


DRE: [laughing] No, it is.


SYLVIA: Thank you.


AUSTIN: Think it’s --  Think it’s the one I just linked.  I hope!


SYLVIA: Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  And this one is not a link I clicked yet, so…


AUSTIN: Okay.


[Sylvia laughs]


AUSTIN: That’s here, that’s left here, and the friends…
SYLVIA: God, the cover art for this is so sexy.


AUSTIN: It’s so good.


DRE: It’s very good.


AUSTIN: Si.  Killin’ it.


SYLVIA: Oh, was it Si who did it?  That’s awesome.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


SYLVIA: I thought it looked like their work, but…


AUSTIN: Yeah, totally.  [pause]  Palisade… Live…  Okay.  All right, I’m publishing, and then I’m gonna make a Tweet.  But yeah, I’m going -- I’m going hard on it in a way that’s just goofy.  I’m really enjoying it.  It’s like, I don’t know the last time I’ve really enjoyed a game.  Like, this is in that tier of like, top tier.


SYLVIA: Oh, for sure.


AUSTIN: My brain is just like, in love with this, like, my brain has just calmed itself deeply by throwing itself into a thing, you know?


SYLVIA: Abso-fucking-lutely.  It’s so nice.  I needed it.


AUSTIN: Yeah.  [pause]  Let people filter in a little bit here…  And we should now be live.  Should be.  I guess we’ll see.  Give it a few minutes though.  Dre, what type of -- What’s your build situation?  What are you rolling?  Stat-wise?


DRE: I’m looking forward to when I can re-spec, ‘cause I kinda like -- I kinda went all over the place to start, but I think I’ve settled into doing Dex, ever since I found the claw that…


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Yeah, that claw is real good.


SYLVIA: [crosstalk] The claw is sick.


AUSTIN: The claw is sick.


DRE: God, the claw fucking rules.  I was like, banging my head against Godrick, and then I was like I’m just gonna be a little gremlin with the claw. 


AUSTIN: And just get in there.  Just get in there.


DRE: Yeah.


SYLVIA: This game rewards being a little goblin.  It really, really does.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] It really does.  It really does.  I, um --


DRE: And I’m interested in doing some Faith stuff too, especially -- I don’t know if you all have like, unlocked the stuff that’s hidden behind the like, ent doors and the…


AUSTIN: Yes.


SYLVIA: Only a couple, but yeah.


DRE: Yeah.  In the -- I forget what it’s called.  The Tarnished headquarters.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] The Round -- The Roundtable Hold.


SYLVIA: [crosstalk] Oh, the Roundtable?  Oh, I haven’t unlocked that, I’m not there yet.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


DRE: [crosstalk] There’s some -- There’s some stuff there.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Have you found -- Have you found the Faith claws in that building?


DRE: N -- No?


SYLVIA: Oh!


AUSTIN: There’s some Faith claws in that building; you need a high Faith, but they’re sick.


SYLVIA: I’m doing Strength-based, so I’m gonna look for those now.  I probably won’t have the Dex for it, but I’m gonna look for it.


AUSTIN: I don’t know that they’re -- They might not --


DRE: [crosstalk] Ooh.  Maybe I have.


AUSTIN: They’re down in the -- You know the place you can jump down to?


DRE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


AUSTIN: There’s a little side room there that you should investigate instead of… you know.


DRE: No, I think I found them and I didn’t realize they were claws ‘cause the icon looks like a rod.


AUSTIN: Oh.  It looks like a rod, it is not.  Imagine that is just coming out of your hand.  Like you’re Ezio, except you’re wielding like -- I don’t want to spoil what it is ‘cause it’s so cool.


DRE: Okay.  All right.


AUSTIN: Anyway, they’re sick, they’re sick.  It’s a good game.  All right people --


DRE: If I just --


AUSTIN: Oh, go ahead.


DRE: -- did Godrick, how  far away am I from being able to re-spec?


AUSTIN: I’m not at re-specing yet.  [Dre: Okay.  Shit.]  So, I would, at this point just focus on -- Just focus on putting -- My real thought though Dre, is like, you don’t need to re-spec.  This is a super long game, [Dre: That’s true.] in such a way that I bet you’re being benefited by wherever you put your points.  It’s just that --


DRE: Level 30 feels like a big number, but it’s really, it’s not.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] It does.  I’m on Level 55 and I haven’t done the second dungeon yet.


DRE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: You know what I mean?  The second of six?  Main dungeons?  Or whatever?


DRE: Jesus.


AUSTIN: You know?  And then probably an endgame?  So… I don’t know.  I truly believe that unless you dumped twenty points into Arcane, I think you’re gonna be okay, you know?


DRE: Mmm.


SYLVIA: I do need to come up with some Arcane.


AUSTIN: Arcane seems cool, I don’t want that Lux stat, I’ve seen some cool blood magic using Arcane…


SYLVIA: I just want to get more items, honestly.


AUSTIN: Ah, uh-huh.


SYLVIA: Give me more shit, please.


AUSTIN: Give me more shit!


SYLVIA: I haven’t found like, the ring that increases my drop rate or whatever, that like, Dark Souls had.


AUSTIN: Yeah… Yeah.  A classic, a classic.


DRE: [intrigued] Oh.


SYLVIA: I don’t know if that’s in this game.


AUSTIN: It must be.  I found a bunch of other stuff.


DRE: Are there rings?


AUSTIN: There’s talismans in this.


SYLVIA: Talismans, yeah


DRE: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I really want more talisman slots.


SYLVIA: This fucking critical-hit-giving-you-back-HP talisman is so good.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] I know.


SYLVIA: So good.


AUSTIN: Sylvia, I just found one that gives back FP and it feels like I can be like, a full-time caster now.


SYLVIA: [whispers] Oh my god.


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh-huh.


SYLVIA: ‘Cause that’d work so well with my mace.


AUSTIN: It’s so good.  It’s so good.


SYLVIA: I love video games.  I love video games.
AUSTIN: Me too.  Me too.  [Sylvia laughs]  I love it when the rest of the world vanishes and I can just be wandering a hellscape instead, you know?


SYLVIA: Yep.


AUSTIN: All right.  [pause]  No, that doesn’t -- Yeah, six main dungeons, Atez, that does not cover side stuff, including big side stuff.  So like, Castle Morne, which I think is probably the first big side dungeon area, is not counted in that six.  That’s a small dungeon.  That’s not -- That doesn’t count.  There’s six Legacy dungeons.


SYLVIA: Sick area though.


AUSTIN: The -- Yeah, it’s a sick area.  I found a bunch of other side stuff that’s like as big as that elsewhere.  And it’s like, it doesn’t even signal necessarily -- Like, sometimes it does, like “Oh, that’s a big magic manor on a hilltop, that’s gonna be kind of a beefy thing.”  But other times it’s just like “Oh, I’m going into a mine,” and then it ended up being this huge multi-hour endeavor of me trying to, you know, work my way through this mine that was like, running upwards, not just inside of a cliff, but alongside its outer edges and like, that ended up bringing me to a whole new area, and I was like “All right.  I just thought I was going down in a mine and kill a few people, but no, it turns out I’m now at the top of the peaks.”  Anyway, we should do the thing we’re here to do and not just talk about Elden Ring.


SYLVIA: Right.  Yeah.


AUSTIN: But… We should go to time.is is what we should do.


SYLVIA: Right.


DRE: Oh, yeah.


AUSTIN: Thirty?


SYlVIA: Sure.


DRE: Sure.


[sound of a clap]


AUSTIN: All right.  Let me double check my backup’s going… All right!


[MUSICAL INTERLUDE.  TIMESTAMP 6:46]


AUSTIN: That recording…


JACK: This is a day for us.


AUSTIN: Then… it… This hit “Go Live...”  Go here and hit “Publish Now...”  Then go to Twitter…


ART: I’ll say it: They say “World Animal Day,” but it’s a dot-co -- dot-org-dot-uk url and the only content on the thing is “Events from Africa” and I no longer understand what’s going on here from World Animal Day.


JACK: Mmm.  Hmm.


KEITH: Well, people in other parts don’t need to remember animals, we already remember them.


ART: Mmm.


JACK:  But in the UK, and apparently, we need to -- In the UK, apparently we all need to remember African animals.


KEITH: Yeah.


JACK: God.


ART: Oh, it seems if I click on another continent, I’ll get their…


AUSTIN: A different -- There you go.


KEITH: “What you do today can improve all your tomorrows.”


JACK: This is a genre of time.is quote that is… on some reading, conceptually true, but is just filtered through such an annoying, condescending that I can -- You know, if, for example, today I pushed the button that gave me, you know, 500,000 dollars every two weeks, that might improve all my tomorrows.


AUSTIN: Wait, you have that button?  What?


ART: Why haven’t you pushed that button?


AUSTIN: Press the button.


KEITH: Yeah, push the button.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Press the button, Jack!


JACK: Okay, I --
KEITH: Why aren’t you doing this?


ART: You’re being a fool.


JACK: I’ve pushed the button.  Nothing has happened.


AUSTIN: Well, it’s for tomorrow.


KEITH: [crosstalk] Well, you’ve got to wait till tomorrow!


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: C’mon, pay attention.


JACK: Oh, I see, right.  It’s gonna start improving.


AUSTIN: Yeah.  All right.  Ready to do a clap?  Forty -- Forty-five seconds?


JACK: Yep!


ART: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Giving ourselves a lot of time.


[sound of a clap]


AUSTIN: I think someone was a little early, but that’s okay.


ART: I thought someone was really late.


KEITH: I thought everyone was right on time.


AUSTIN: Hm.


ART: Hm.


AUSTIN: Huh.  How -- How does that go?  Weird.


JACK: Weird.  That’s strange to me.


AUSTIN: Hm.


[MUSICAL INTERLUDE: TIMESTAMP 9:03]


JACK: Hey, is a toaster roaster some method of heating the toaster to more accurately…


KEITH: Yes, yeah, when you need to roast a toaster.


SYLVIA: Yeah, it’s when --


KEITH: You’re toaster’s too cold and you have to heat it up.


JACK: Yeah, because they say --


SYLVIA: (crosstalk) Or it’s the -- I was gonna say, or if the person who makes your toast messes it up and you gotta like, just insult them for a little while, then you’re a toaster roaster.


JACK: Yeah.  Oh!  You’ve -- Yeah, what’s your best toast roast -- (breaks off laughing)  Think of someone -- Like, a toast-based way I would insult someone for making toast badly.


[laughter]


SYLVIA: Uhhh…


KEITH: I have a convection oven, toaster oven.


JACK: Off to a good start.


KEITH: I have a convection toaster oven and one of the ways that they advertise toaster ovens is by showing you chicken that it can fit.  [Sylvia laughs]  And… like it really will say like, “Can cook a twelve-pound chicken” or something.  And so I technically have a toaster roaster.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Are we talking about Ron Po- Popeil?  What are we -- Who are we talking about?


KEITH: What’s that?


AUSTIN: Are we talking about Ron Popeil?  Who are we talking about?


SYLVIA: No, we’re talking about a convection toaster oven.


AUSTIN: Mm.


KEITH: Yeah, my convection toaster oven was advertised as being able to roast a chicken.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Yeah, this is… Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  Ron --
KEITH: So I have a -- I own a toaster roaster.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Is it --


SYLVIA: I don’t know who Ron Popeil is.


AUSTIN: Oh, wow.  How times change.


KEITH: I actually also don’t know who Ron Popeil is, but I know that I’ve heard the name.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] You don’t know who -- Ronco?  Set It and Forget It?  The rotisserie chicken guy?


KEITH: Ohhh, okay.


ALI: [crosstalk] Oh.


AUSTIN: This was like -- This is like a classic infomercial that would be on TV all the time as a kid, for me.


KEITH: Did this guy invent “Set It and Forget It?”


AUSTIN: Yeah, this is “Set It and Forget It.”  [Ali laughs]  Well, okay, he probably didn’t actually invent it, but -- I mean…  I don’t --


SYLVIA: I don’t know if this like, just, reached Canada.  Or maybe it did and I just --


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] I would bet that that’s -- I would bet you’re right.


SYLVIA: I don’t know.  I don’t recognize any of this shit on the Ronco Wikipedia page.


AUSTIN: Yeah, I mean I -- Yeah, that makes sense to me, that , you know… I don’t know that he came up with it, but Ronco, Ron Popeil was like a -- And the thing that you’re describing was all over these ads, all over these infomercials, was like… you know.


KEITH: “This thing can cook a fourteen-pound chicken!”


AUSTIN: No, no, you’re missing -- That’s not how Ron Popeil was.


KEITH: Oh.


ALI: Whoa.


KEITH: Sorry, that -- I was doing the other -- I was doing the OxiClean guy.
AUSTIN: You were doing OxiClean.  That’s the thing is, the Oxi -- Okay.  OxiClean was a Seachange in this stuff.  I mean, that’s not true because OxiClean is just a continuation of the guy with the money all over -- the question marks?  Nope, the dollar signs.  I was thinking of -- The guy who looks like the Riddler, but with dollar signs?  What’s that guy called?


[Jack chuckles]


KEITH: Mon-ler.


AUSTIN: No, no, the real guy.  The guy who’s like, “I can save you money!  Buddy!”  [laughs]  Now I’m just doing the guy from Bioshock.


SYLVIA: Oh, I have no idea.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] What is this --  Matthew Lesko?  You’ve not seen the Matthew Lesko commercials?


KEITH: No, I don’t know what that is.


SYLVIA: [crosstalk] I’m googling this guy too.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Guess what, I’m gonna --


KEITH: I thought you were doing the arcade game where you -- with the Monopoly guy where you roll corn…


SYLVIA: Um??


AUSTIN: Yeah, you’ve not -- You don’t know this guy?


SYLVIA: Who…?  Who??


[A video of Matthew Lesko can be heard in the background saying “Apple computer with eight draws per row!]


KEITH: Wait, who are you asking?


AUSTIN: Matthew Lesko.  I linked --I linked in the chat.


[MATTHEW LESKO: I’m Matthew Lesko and you’ve probably seen me on Oprah, Larry King, or Letterman and I --]


AUSTIN: He -- He’s like one of these guys --


JACK: He really is…


AUSTIN: Yeah.  Oh, actually wait, he actually just straight-up has question marks.


KEITH: He has on…!


SYLVIA: Yeah, he has question marks.


[MATTHEW LESKO: Can change your life!]


ALI: Wow.


[MATTHEW LESKO: Can get a better job, get an education, or start your own business!]


KEITH: No, I don’t know this guy.


AUSTIN: Anyway, he’s bad.  I actually don’t know that he’s bad, I suspect that he’s bad.  My -- My instinct is -- What he sold was access to… access to how-to guides to get government funding for things, basically.  But in ways that I always felt were like, “Mmm?  I don’t know.”


KEITH: [reading] “Matthew Lesko’s free money, how to get government grants for the whole family.”


AUSTIN: [laughs] Oh my god, this quote: [Ali giggles] “In an interview with the Washington Post in 2007, Lesko admitted to having assembled his books from government guides to grants and loans.  Quoting Lesko as saying of his first book ‘I plagiarized the whole thing and I didn’t write a lick.’”


KEITH: I do know this guy!


AUSTIN: Wait.  “Lesko later added, ‘I get stuff for free and I sell it for as much as I can get.”!!  [Ali laughs]  The Divine-comma-Arbitrage!


[laughter]


KEITH: I --


SYLVIA: Okay, so now we know what the Divine looks like.  It’s a guy in a silly suit.


[Keith laughs uncontrollably]


AUSTIN: Ohhh my god. Ohhh.  Anyway.


KEITH: I -- I swear to god, I saw a video of this guy a month ago saying those exact words.  Like, as an old man being like, “Yeah, I got -- I just took it all from government stuff and just sold it in a book.”


AUSTIN: Yes.  Yes.  Uh-huh.  And who knows if any of it was legal, actually.  Who could say.  Anyway, my point is, Ron Popeil was like, your nice grandpa.  “Hey, if you guys wanna ever, you know, come over and have a little chicken, I can help -- I got this great device.  I got this great invention that I made to help you chop your food and do a rotisserie chicken in a tiny air grill.”  Anyway.


KEITH: I bet he says “Look at that” a lot.


AUSTIN: He does.  That’s the type of guy he is.  “Look at that.”


KEITH: “Look at that.”


[Ali laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah.  “That’s -- Isn’t that -- That’s just great.”  That’s the type of guy he is.  Anyway, my point being, OxiClean guy is an extension of Matt Lesko.  The Ron Popeil has kind of vanished from this scene.  It’s all Matt Leskos now, it’s all OxiClean guys now.  There’s no Ron Popeil of crypto.  It’s all fucking OxiClean guy.


SYLVIA: The Popeil’s lost.


AUSTIN: That’s right.


KEITH: Wow.


SYLVIA: You can’t spell “Popeil” without “L;” it says something…


AUSTIN: In 2000, we had Ron Popeil, Steve Jobs…


ALI: Wow.


AUSTIN: Et cetera.  Anyway.  Should we go back to this game that we’re playing?


ALI: Mm-hm.


SYLVIA: This guy’s name is Po Peil…


[laughter]


[MUSICAL INTERLUDE: TIMESTAMP 14:58]
[laughter]


ALI: It gets framed like a -- It was on like a rollercoaster.


JANINE: [crosstalk] What’s happening!?  Are you actually in a boat?


[Ali laughs]


ALI: Wait, what?


AUSTIN: There was a joke earlier.  It’s fine.


ALI: Oh.


JANINE: About you being on a boat because of all that background noise.


ALI: Ohhh.


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.


ALI: Yeah, spiritually, I guess I am.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: Why are your hands just wet?


ALI: I don’t know.  Maybe condensation from my seltzer can.


JANINE: Oh, that -- Yeah.  That --


ALI: [laughs] But like was that an -- I guess it was because I got a blast there, but that’s never happened to me and it’s like, enough to… Yowza.  Anyway, hi everybody. [laughs]


AUSTIN: Hi everybody, welcome to a new one of these.  I’m not -- I’ll do a real intro in a second.  [Ali laughs] [pause]  I have to do a Tweet, so…


ART: I just got ten points just for clicking on a search for The Batman.


AUSTIN: This is -- This is -- Oh my god.


ALI: This is -- I can’t believe how much you’re getting got right now.


[Ali and Janine laugh]


ART: But that’s not hurting me, I -- I’m not even absorbing this information.


ALI: [laughs] Okay.  Okay.


AUSTIN: You know how many people are half -- Mm.


ALI: [crosstalk] The Batman -- The Batman can now be like “the most googled movie in the DC universe --”


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Yeah.  Well, “the most Bing’ed movie” to be honest.


ALI: [laughing] “We’re the most Bing’ed movie in the DC universe.  You gotta see it now.  Batman.”


AUSTIN: I can’t -- And you’re saying it out loud into a microphone in front of an audience of eleven concurrent viewers.


ALI: Mm-hm, yeah.


ART: Well, this is just continuing a bit that we’ve already done, this is -- I’m just…


AUSTIN: They’re counting on us doing bits, Art, this is how they work.


ALI: Mm-hm.


JANINE: Bing is a bit-based economy.  It’s all based on funny bits.


ALI: [crosstalk] Now the next person who buys -- who buys a computer…


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


ALI: And they’re like, “Please use Microsoft Edge, please!  Please use Microsoft Edge!”  They’re gonna be like “Well, Art from Friends at the Table said that it wasn’t that bad.”


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: It’s not that --


[pause]


AUSTIN: Did we lose Art?  Did they come for Art?


JANINE: [crosstalk] You don’t have to use --


[Ali laughs]


JANINE: Maybe.


ART: Am I not coming through?


AUSTIN: Oh, you’re back, you’re back.  I missed you for a second there.


ART: It’s just, it’s -- It’s a fine web browser.


AUSTIN: Mmm.  Hm.


JANINE: You could -- You could -- I mean, you don’t have to use Edge to use Bing, right?  You could -- You could be truly Chaotic Neutral and set Bing as your Chrome browser, right?


AUSTIN: You could.  


ART: Yeah, I guess.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] I mean, Bing is already -- I think we already talked about this that Bing already just runs on Chrome -- Or, Edge already just runs on Chromium, so it already kind of is.


JANINE: Oh, whatever.  You know what I mean.


ART: I really think Bing is terrible, but that Edge is fine, is my real…


AUSTIN: Mm.  Mm-hm.  [Ali laughs]  Well, that’ll work out.


JANINE: What if like -- What if like, somehow Alta Vista came back.  They were like, “We’re back.  Every time you do a search on Alta Vista --”


AUSTIN: Alta Vista never went away -- Oh, it did, it got bought by Yahoo.


JANINE: “We’ll give you a quarter.  We’ll give you a quarter.”  Would you be like --


ALI: A whole quarter?


AUSTIN: A quarter?  I mean…


JANINE: [crosstalk] “No way, wait.  That’s scary.”  Or would you be like, “Cool, a quarter.  I love quarters.  I love goog-- I love Alta Vista-ing.”


AUSTIN: I do a lot of searches, Janine.


JANINE: Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: A quarter?!


JANINE: A quarter.


AUSTIN: Yeah!


ALI: That’s a lot!


AUSTIN: Catch me on Alta Vista, I guess.


ALI: That’s three dollars a day, at least.


JANINE: Mm-hm, but you wouldn’t like, question -- So, this is -- For me, this coming from like, when I was a preteen --


AUSTIN: “I wouldn’t question it?”  Everyone on the internet’s already trying to rob me.


JANINE: Okay.  [Ali laughs]  When I was a preteen on the internet, there was this website that I found.  I don’t remember how I found it.


AUSTIN: Oh, boy.


JANINE: I don’t remember what it was called.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


JANINE: But, it was a website where you signed up and you could keep track of your chores every week.  And you got points for every chore that you did.  So I made up a bunch of -- And -- So you could go, also then trade the points in for stuff.  So I made up a bunch of chores that I did not do at all , ‘cause they were fake, and then just checked them off and got points, and then they mailed me -- I picked out a necklace and they mailed me a necklace and my parents were very mad because they did not, at the time, ask you for parental permission for any of this.


AUSTIN: Ahh.  Yeah.


JANINE: And then -- And also, who’s paying for that necklace?  What -- What’s the scheme?  I don’t remember if there were -- In my memory, there were no ads on it, but there must have been, right?


ALI: Yeah.


JANINE: Unless it was just a child address farm, where they were just getting addresses for children for some reason, like -- I didn’t question it at all, I was like “Cool, I love a necklace.  I love a free necklace for work I didn’t do, thank you so much.”


ART: And now you drink Dr. Pepper all the time and you can’t think of why.


ALI: Mmm.


[Janine laughs]


AUSTIN: I just think that I could do a Google search - I could do a web search once every ten seconds, easy.  Like, rest-- You know, just by, resting, which would be a hundred and fifty dollars an hour.


JANINE: [crosstalk] Just make a bot for it.


AUSTIN: A hundred and fifty dollars an hour?  Yeah, I’m doin’ it.  That’s -- That’s the offer you’ve given me.  I’ll catch y’all on Alta Vista.  [Ali chuckles]  Y’all are gettin’ good Christmas gifts this year.  [Janine laughs]  All right.  We should do -- We should do this podcast.  Let me get my pdf and my notes and everything else up.  Okay.


ALI:  I do need my pdf.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm.


ART: Nice thing about Microsoft Edge is it’s also a pdf viewer.  I just have it right on the tab.


JANINE: Yeah, I use it as my like, I’m just too lazy to get a real pdf viewer, so I just use Microsoft Edge for viewing pdfs.


AUSTIN: It’s fine, I’m happy about this actually.  [Ali laughs]  I’m proud of us about this.


JANINE:  I have it open right now with Wagon Wheel.


[MUSICAL INTERLUDE: TIMESTAMP: 20:45]


[several claps in succession, one very late]


AUSTIN: Ooh.  There was a real late…


JACK: What happened there?


[Ali laughs]


KEITH: I think that -- I skipped a couple and I thought I timed it out good, but I maybe didn’t.


AUSTIN: I see.  No.  Let’s do 1:05.


ALI: Wait, you skipped --


AUSTIN: No, okay.


KEITH: Time.is skipped numbers.


AUSTIN: The number didn’t happen.


ALI: Oh, sure, okay.


AUSTIN: All right, fifteen.


[pause, claps]


KEITH: Okay, that was clean.


SYLVIA: If someone talks after we set the clap time--


AUSTIN: I know, we just have to eject, I know, I know.


ALI: [laughing] As soon as -- ‘Cause the way Keith said it --


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] I always do it just in case.


ALI: Yeah.  The way Keith said it, I thought that he was just like, freelance, like he wasn’t on time.is, he was just like, “I’m gonna count this out.  I’m going to a time thing and --”


[laughter]


KEITH: I like to feel it, I like to feel the beat.  I like to feel the rhythm.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


SYLVIA: I like jazz class.


JACK: The way I used to do it before I knew that time.is was real.


AUSTIN: Yeah.  Right, the old way.


KEITH: I forgot about that.
SYLVIA: [crosstalk] God, I forgot about that too!


KEITH: Oh my god!


AUSTIN: It’s so funny.


SYLVIA: That’s such a good bit of Friends at the Table lore.


KEITH: That was so funny.


JACK: [quietly] Oh my god.


KEITH: Yeah, I just like to sit and feel one minute passing.


ALI: Uh-huh. 


JACK: Yeah, Keith has perfect time, it’s like perfect pitch but for the exact length of a second.


AUSTIN:  [laughing] Right.


KEITH: Yeah, I grew up with weird training that let me shoot guns real good and also know what one minute is.


[Jack and Ali laugh]


JACK: You have eight passports in a safety deposit box in Zurich.


AUSTIN: [laughing] Is Keith Jason Bourne?!


KEITH: This is uh -- This is --


JACK: I don’t know how he can do this.


KEITH: This is -- This is Gunslinger trivia.  [Austin: Gotcha.]  One of the things that Roland from The Gunslinger does a couple times is prove that he knows exactly what one minute is without counting.


JACK: That’s such a funny bit.  God--


AUSTIN: That’s very funny.


KEITH: The idea that he --


JACK: That’s a real Guybrush Threepwood bit.
KEITH: The idea that he can do it without counting has fascinated me for… like eighteen years now.  I think it’s so funny that part of it is that he’s, “No, I’m not counting it’s not that I know what sixty seconds is.  It’s that I can feel a minute.”


AUSTIN: [crosstalk]  He feels it.  Yeah, he feels a minute.  Yeah, mm-hm.  We all can do this, it’s just not, we’re not accurate.


KEITH: Right.


AUSTIN: Like, you can feel -- [Keith: Yeah.]  You could like, do the dishes and be like, “That was ten minutes.”  [Keith: Yeah.]  And most of the time it was like, thirteen minutes and you’re wrong, but you know it wasn’t one minute, you know?


KEITH: Yeah.


SYLVIA: I feel every minute, trust me.


AUSTIN: Damn.  True.  All right.


[MUSICAL INTERLUDE: TIMESTAMP: 23:18]


AUSTIN:  Happy February everybody.


JACK: Oh!


SYLVIA: [sarcastically] Valentine’s is just around the corner, what’s everybody got planned?


[various grumbles and sighs from the others]


[Sylvia laughs]


JACK: I’m gonna go on a romantic… boat ride in the Huntington gardens.


ALI: Oh.


AUSTIN: Is that a real pl--  Wait.  I guess they have.  They have some — I guess some gardens have —


JANINE: Gardens in LA?  Yeah.


AUSTIN: No, boat rides in a garden.


[Ali and Jack laugh]


JANINE: Oh.
JACK: In Los Angeles they do have gardens and boats, but I don’t know that they do boat rides in the Huntington Gardens.  The last time I was there I spent the whole drive there talking big talk about how I was very excited to see a turtle at the Huntington Gardens and Kat kept gently suggesting that there might not be a turtle there, they’re not sure.  And I walked right through the gate, walked right up to a pond, and a turtle swam up out of the water towards me.


SYLVIA: It knew.


JACK: It knew!  It had been talking a big game about how I was coming to visit.


SYLVIA: It was so excited to see a British person.


[Ali and Austin laugh]


JANINE: It’s turtle spouse was like, “Well, a British person might not come today.”


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh-huh.


JACK: That turtle was like, “Yes!”


AUSTIN: “I told you.”


JACK: Ostensibly a once, quote-unquote, “great county, now faded.”


[laughter]


AUSTIN: Well, speaking of --


JANINE: “It’s children scattered to the winds.”


AUSTIN: Speaking of faded nobility, we should do this podcast.  That’s about the character, not about the podcast, the podcast was never noble..


JACK: Deeply ignoble podcast.


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh-huh.  I almost said “All right, time.is” but we’ve done that, we did that part already.


JANINE: We did.


AUSTIN: So.  All right.


JANINE: Wait, I have a quick Valentine fact.


AUSTIN: Sure.


ALI: All right.


JANINE: This is for February.  I just -- It’s a quick Valentine fact, ‘cause I just saw it on Twitter.  In the Japanese version of Fifty Shades of Gray…


AUSTIN: Oh fuck.


JANINE: This main guy’s voice actor is also the voice actor for Kaiba from Yu-gi-oh.


SYLVIA: Oh my fucking god.


AUSTIN: That’s so funny.  That’s extremely good.


ALI: Wowie.


AUSTIN: It’s extremely funny.


JANINE: I’ll link you to this, Sylvie.


[Ali laughs]


SYLVIA: Thank you.  Thank you.  I hope everyone knows that’s because of the Kaiba stuff, right?


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.


SYLVIA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.


ALI: Wait, what?


SYLVIA: Linking to me ‘cause of Kaiba, not ‘cause I’m into Fifty Shades of Gray.  We need to be clear.


ALI: Oh, oh.


JANINE: People are ironically into Fifty Shades of Gray now, it’s fine either way.


SYLVIA: Listen, I have a high tolerance for this shit, I made my friends watch Twilight on Halloween, but I don’t have that level.


AUSTIN: Mm.  Mm-hm.
