AUSTIN: Ali, you can cut this part down [laughs]. Hi, Ali. I hope your day is good. Y’all have any messages for Ali?


SYLVIA: Hey, Ali. 


DRE: Hey, Ali. Thanks again for that cat video of the cat carrying birds on its back.


AUSTIN: Oh yeah, sick. 


SYLVIA: That Bluff City channel we have is just good videos, basically.


DRE: [laughing] It is. 


AUSTIN: That’s basically it [laughs].


SYLVIA: It’s great. 


AUSTIN: Yeah. It’s really good. God. And like, bad videos, but good bad videos. 


SYLVIA: So I posted that weird Boston one in there, of the guys trying to ransom the fuckin’ Red Sox pennant that they found.


AUSTIN: Oh, right. God. Jesus. 


SYLVIA: Yeah [laughs]. The second that flipped, I was like, “Oh, this is Bluff City.” [laughs]


[Dre laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh-huh. 


DRE: [surprised] Aahh! I was just scrolling through Bluff City and I saw this picture Janine sent of pouring ketchup into an avocado. 


AUSTIN: Hate it.


DRE: Uh, yeah, I hate that. 


SYLVIA: Back with the body horror, huh, Janine?


[Austin and Dre laugh]


AUSTIN: God. 


[Sylvia sighs]


AUSTIN: Okay. Um. [dog barks in background]


DRE: Shoutouts to Einstein.


AUSTIN: Hell yeah.


SYLVIA: Yeah. I don’t know what he’s barking at, but, you know.


AUSTIN: So— 


SYLVIA: Hopefully he’ll calm down.


AUSTIN: Do you—still not in the recording, still not actually do this [typing]. I thought I knew where the Book of Life wound up but now I’m not—now I’m less sure. 


DRE: Oh, God. Where did that—


SYLVIA: Ooh.


DRE: Did I have it?


AUSTIN: Yeah, I think you did. I think you did. Because that’s the whole thing, was like—yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally. Totally. You had it, you have it from—it’s in the final shot of you with your crystal. 


[Sylvia laughs]


DRE: God.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh. 


DRE: [whiny teenage boy voice] That’s my gun-crystal, Ephrim, don’t laugh! 


[Austin laughs]


SYLVIA: Yeah, okay, whatever. Whatever you say.


AUSTIN: Okay, so. That’s fine then. So, using that and using—so, using the Book of Life—one second, let me get a good lead-in for Ali.




[musical interlude, 2:24]




AUSTIN: It’s Scottish. You flip it. It’s like ‘Farve’.


[Keith laughs]


AUSTIN: You know, Scottish?


KEITH: I was doing a Macklemore bit.


DRE: Did you say like Farve?


AUSTIN: Yeah, like Brett—like Farve. 


DRE: The famous Scotsman, Brett Farve [laughs].


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh-huh. No true—


KEITH: Did he flip something in his name? 


AUSTIN: Yeah, Brett Favre is spelled F-A-V-R-E. [pronouncing phonetically] Fav-re. 


DRE: Yeah, like Fav-re. Favor. 


AUSTIN: Favor.


DRE: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Yeah.


KEITH: Wait, is it really?


AUSTIN: A hundred percent.


DRE: Uh-huh.


AUSTIN: One thousand percent. 


KEITH: Wowww. I had no idea.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh. Brett Favre [pronounced Far-ve]. 


KEITH: Because it’s called [Far-ve].


AUSTIN: It is [laughing]. It is what we all say. 


KEITH: We all say [Far-ve].


AUSTIN: Why is it pronounced like that?


KEITH: [Farrr-ve]


AUSTIN: I’ve written down [Fav-re]


KEITH: Is it just [Fahve], is that how you’re supposed to pronounce it, like [Fahve]


AUSTIN: A Parisian—According to quora.com—


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Which is like Yahoo Answers but for Silicon Valley people, “‘Why is Brett Favre’s name pronounced [Farve]?’ Simple answer: Phonotactics. In English, certain consonant clusters are not permitted in the coda, and some other consonant clusters in the onset of a syllable—” This person is not—


KEITH: That is not an answer!


AUSTIN: [tiredly] Uh-huh.


DRE: Respect the coda!


KEITH: They answered the question—


AUSTIN: Eric Nelson says that, “A Parisian would pronounce it roughly as [Far-rah]. Truth is, there is no legitimate way that it can be pronounced [Farve].” [laughs]


KEITH: There’s—


AUSTIN: [laughing] There’s no legitimate way. 


DRE: Unless you’re from fuckin’ Mississippi. 


KEITH: I don’t think a Parisian would pronounce it [Far-rah].


AUSTIN: [Fah-vrah]


KEITH: I don’t think that that’s how someone from Fr—As someone that at one point in time was—


DRE: Was from France?


KEITH: —fluent in French.


DRE: Oh, okay.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


KEITH: I was—I used to be fluent in French—


AUSTIN: I’ve heard this.


KEITH: And I do not believe that you would ever pronounce [Fah-vrah]. I don’t think that that’s how it would be. 


DRE: Yeah.


KEITH: I believe it would be [Fahve].


DRE: Well—


KEITH: Or maybe like a little bit of a [Faarh]. But not like a [Far-vra].


DRE: He’s from Mississippi and sends people dick pictures while wearing nothing but Crocs. 


AUSTIN: Ohhh.


DRE: So that’s—


AUSTIN: Mm. That’s not good.


DRE: Those are the rules. Those are the rules. You’ve gotta pronounce it funny.


KEITH: [laughing] That’s—Oh, sorry, I didn’t know that that was the dick-pics-Croc rule.


DRE: Yeah, uh-huh.


AUSTIN: That’s a Louisiana thing? Mississippi, sorry. 


DRE: Mississippi, yeah.


AUSTIN: Sorry to Louisiana.


KEITH: Croc is actually spelled C-R-O-C. I mean—


AUSTIN: That’s—yeah, that’s right [laughing].


KEITH: Oh shit, I spelled it right by accident! I accidentally did it right. Hold on, let me take that again. 


AUSTIN: Great. Yeah, try again. Can we get one more? Yeah. 


KEITH: Yeah. Croc is actually spelled R-C-O-C. 


SYLVIA: There you go. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, that’s right.


DRE: Oh that—okay. Alright. At first I didn’t know what joke you were going for [laughs]. 


AUSTIN: Me either. Let’s do a time.is, how’s that sound to people?


DRE: A very sleepy time.is. 


AUSTIN: A very sleepy time.is.


DRE: Five-thirty’s early, I don’t know if y’all have woke up at five-thirty lately. 


AUSTIN: That’s too godamn early.


DRE: It’s very early. 


KEITH: I have been going to bed at five-thirty, so I do know about how early it is.


[Mixed groans and laughs]


AUSTIN: That’s where I’ve been recently. 


SYLVIA: Yeah.


AUSTIN: It’s sick, I love it. I love to be—


SYLVIA: It’s so much fun. 


KEITH: I hate it. It really makes me feel bad.


AUSTIN: All the way through, right?


KEITH: When I—I’m so—my body is so not good at like, going to bed early and then waking up at a reasonable time. And by early, I mean like going to bed at two o’clock—


AUSTIN: Two or three AM, yeah—


KEITH: —and waking up at like ten, right? 


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh-huh.


KEITH: That would be perfect, ‘cause I love the morning and I love—it’s like, I’m awake for five hours and it’s still early afternoon.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


KEITH: But I just can’t do it. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. And the thing that actually is probably—like, clinical insomnia is really what it is. 


AUSTIN: Is actually what it is, yeah.


DRE: Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: Yep. What was the name of this document that I told you to open again?


DRE: Oh shit, yeah. That thing.


KEITH: Dark...Dark Night...Rises.


AUSTIN: That’s it, yep [laughs], you got it. 


KEITH: Don’t Let Us Die and the Dark Knight Rises?


AUSTIN: Don’t Let Us Die—


DRE: Cold Winter Scratch, is that what you’re talking about, Austin?


AUSTIN: I mean, that also. I meant my PDF though, is what I actually meant.


DRE: Oh, okay.


KEITH: Do Not Let Us Die in the Dark Night of This Cold Winter?


AUSTIN: That’s it.


DRE: There it is.


KEITH: Is that what you’re talking about?


AUSTIN: That is what it is. 


KEITH: I was close. 


AUSTIN: You’re close. And then yeah, what is our Scratch file called?


KEITH: This was fifty pages, I did not read all of that. 


AUSTIN: No, that’s fine. 


DRE: Cold Winter Scratch.


AUSTIN: [typing] Cold...Winter...Scratch.


DRE: Honestly, Keith, like if you look at page thirty-four, that kind of runs through the steps.


KEITH: Oh great, I didn’t even get there.


AUSTIN: That’s fine. It’s also kind of approp—I kind of like the notion of like—


KEITH: Yeah, just teach me.


AUSTIN: Of like, Fero shows up, Fero doesn’t know what the fuck is going on [laughs].


KEITH: That’s a good idea. 


[Dre chuckles]


AUSTIN: You know?


KEITH: Yeah, that makes sense.


AUSTIN: And then, Keith, here is our Scratch doc. I just linked it in Spring. And then we should clap.


KEITH: Is it Cold Winter? Is that what it is?


AUSTIN: Yeah, Cold Winter hyphen Scratch


KEITH: Let me just put that here.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


KEITH: Sorry, I was just in the drive already.


AUSTIN: Oh, in the drawer. Yeah, that’s fine. Should we clap at top of the minute?


SYLVIA: Sure.


DRE: Sure.


KEITH: Yeah.


[pause, followed by claps]


AUSTIN: Oh, good clap.


KEITH: Sounded sick to me. 


AUSTIN: Mm-hm.


KEITH: Sounded a hundred percent perfect to me.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm. Mm.


SYLVIA: Damn bro, sick clap.


KEITH: Yo, you all see that cat?


AUSTIN: That cat is so good.


SYLVIA: That’s a good cat. 


AUSTIN: Y’all can keep talking, ‘cause I have to mark stuff off that I didn’t save in terms of what occurrences we did already, so I need to get rid of these real quick.


KEITH: So, like a week and a half ago, I go to the house that I’m moving into to talk to the landlord about some stuff or whatever, and the cat shows up. It’s the first time I’ve seen Squiggle—head to my Twitter to see Squiggle—and he’s just very nice [Austin sneezes], he’s coming up, he’s rubbing on me and I’m petting him, and I’m like, “Oh, this is great.” I go back on Sunday to sign the lease and Squiggle’s there again, in the yard, running around playing games, Isaac starts petting him and he’s like playing with Isaac’s sleeve and I’m like, “Oh, this is a good cat.” And I’m there today, and the cat’s like, all up on me, trying to get inside the house [laughs], he’s like jumping up on the windows, like, this cat is fucking trying to move into my house.


[Sylvia laughs]


AUSTIN: God.


KEITH: As I’m moving in, this cat’s like, “No, I’m moving in.”


[Dre laughs]




[musical interlude, 8:41]




JACK: [amused] Sadly, I wasn’t recording, so we’re not gonna me speaking it around a cigar.


JANINE: Me either.


JACK: Also, I’m clipping. What the heck? I think when I started, I just spoke very loudly.


JANINE: Hello. 


AUSTIN: I am now, I am now doing the thing.


ALI: Hi.


AUSTIN: Hi. Hello. 


JACK: Hello. Hello.


JANINE: Why do people want a slime bath?


AUSTIN: People—Okay, you know why. 


ALI: Excuse me?


JANINE: No, I don’t mean like Slime Girl, but I mean like main—I mean like—


AUSTIN: [laughing] Mainly, like Main Twitter?  


[Ali and Jack laugh]


JANINE: I was gonna say maincore, and that’s not a thing. It should be. 


AUSTIN: Normcore, normies. Yeah, regular folk?


JANINE: Sure, normies. I don’t like—I don’t like normies, ‘cause, I don’t know—


AUSTIN: I get it. 


JANINE: It’s fine.


JACK: W—


JANINE: But I’m just like, Youtube started recommending me these Lush bath bomb videos, which have been around forever, but for Halloween they do these slime ones, like ectoplasm things.


JACK: Ugh. 


JANINE: And I just can’t think of anything worse than getting into a bath and then there’s a layer of slime on top, and then you get out, and then what happens? You have to take a shower afterwards? 


AUSTIN: You gotta take a shower after that.


JANINE: Like, what’s up? What’s the thing here? I don’t get it.   


ALI: Maybe it’s—


ART: Well, the slime could be made of soap. 


AUSTIN: True. Could be slime-soap. 


JANINE: It’s like viscous slime though; even if it’s soap, it’s still on you.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: You know, like, when you wash your hands, you rinse ‘em afterwards.


ALI: It doesn’t dissolve while the bath is going? ‘Cause that’s really the way that it should [laughs]


JANINE: I mean, you see her put her hand in it and then pull her hand out, and it’s covered in fucking slime.


JACK: [disgusted] Ohh. 


AUSTIN: That’s how the song goes, right?


ART: I had to take Mabel to the vet yesterday because she didn’t get rinsed enough at her most recent bath, so I’m with you on the—


JANINE: Mm.


JACK: Was that what caused her eye problem, was just that she had a bit—she had a soapy eye?


ART: Maybe. We never solved the eye thing.


AUSTIN: Maybe?


JACK: Oh, Mabel.


JANINE: I mean, sometimes you just have shit in your eye, you know?


[Jack sighs deeply]


ART: But yesterday, we noticed a bunch of bumps on her neck, and I was like, “Oh my God, she’s covered in ticks or something.”


[Austin and Janine laugh]


ART: we brought her to the vet and the vet was like, “Did she get a bath recently?” and they were like, “Yeah, not enough rinsing, this is just of soap irritation, it’ll go away.”


JACK: Ohh, Mabel. Oh, Mabel. 


ALI: Ooh, okay. “This slippery stuff isn’t just for show though, it’s made from nutritious skin-softening seaweed, so you’ll emerge from your soak feeling spookily silky.” 


JANINE: But it’s goop! Like, am I silky because I’m covered in goop?


AUSTIN: Excuse me, no, wait, time out [laughs]. Spookily—


[Ali laughs]


JACK: That’s what I was gonna say, Austin. 


AUSTIN: Spookily—


JACK: Spookily silky.


AUSTIN: Silky?


JACK: Spookily silky, which is—I’m trying to—


AUSTIN: Silky, the way a ghost is.


ALI: It’s a Halloween product [laughs].


AUSTIN: No, it isn’t!


[overlapping laughing and talking]


ART: It has a sheet on it, and the sheet’s made of silk. 


JANINE: It smells like candy, so it’s Halloween.


JACK: Okay, obviously you can’t touch a ghost, obviously.


AUSTIN: We have established that on this show pretty well.


JANINE: Let’s start there.


JACK: ‘Cause they’re a ghost.


AUSTIN: [laughing] Have you ever cleaned a ghost before?


JACK: Have I ever cleaned a ghost? [laughs] But if you could touch a ghost, I think they’d be silky.


AUSTIN: No. 


JANINE: You know the origin of ectoplasm, right?


JACK: Eeeeh, Victorians. 


JANINE: Yes. There was like, Victorian mediums, who to impress people would—it was like, gauze, and muslin—


AUSTIN: Nnn.


JANINE: —and fabrics like that, and they would stuff it in their mouths and stuff.


JACK: And then go, [barfing noise] “blllluublublubl.”


JANINE: And then produce it like, “Ohh, I’m possessed by a ghost! Look at all this ectoplasm!” But it’s just, like, phelgm-y gauze, it’s just gauze full of spit.


AUSTIN: There’s other stuff in there. 


JANINE: Like?


AUSTIN: I’ve a—Do you want to know what they were smoothed with?


JANINE: Yes.


JACK: Uh-oh.


JANINE: Sure. 


AUSTIN: Potato starch—


JANINE: Yeah, that makes sense.


AUSTIN: —And in other cases, paper, cloth, and egg white or butter muslin. 


JACK: Okay, this makes sense—


AUSTIN: Gotta get them egg whites in there. Yeah.


JACK: —Except for the fabric [laughs].


AUSTIN: They gotta have a—it has to have like a physicality.


JANINE: Yeah, you need a vector. 


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: You can’t just spit out a bunch of potato starch, people’ll think—


AUSTIN: Ew, you fucking puked! [laughs]


JANINE: People’ll think you just had your lunch out or whatever.


JACK: That’s true. That’s true. What about those—


JANINE: This is also back when people were eating skillet and stuff, which is basically, you could put your muslin in that and there’s your ectoplasm right there, that’s your flour and water.


JACK: Sssskillet. There’s an American rock-Christian band called Skillet.


AUSTIN: Isn’t there a character in a game named Skillet?


JANINE: Probably, it’s a good word. 


AUSTIN: If there isn’t, we should have a Skillet.


JACK: It is a good word.


JANINE: But it’s also just a, you put flour and water in a pan, and then you cook it, kind of, and then you eat it. And it’s like, if you’re very, very poor. 


JACK: And wasn’t there also some really interesting food choices made during rationing?


JANINE: Yes. One of those being—This isn’t really a food choice, this is a choice you can do with food—but there’s the whole thing about using gravy browning to imitate stockings. Because you couldn’t get the stockings.


JACK: Ohhh yeahhh.


JANINE: You just put—not even gravy powder, but like, gravy colorant on your legs.


AUSTIN: [spluttering laugh] Nah.


[Ali laughs]


JANINE: And, like, draw a seam up the back. 


AUSTIN: Mn. You—O—


JANINE: You just [laughs] smell like gravy all day.


AUSTIN: Yum.


JACK: Everyone’s hungry, I guess. 


ALI: What if you sweat? 


JANINE: That’s a treat for your partner. 


JACK: [dismayed] Oh.


AUSTIN: No. 


JANINE: I don’t know, you probably wouldn’t sweat as—I don’t—


AUSTIN: Yes, you would! What do you mean you wouldn’t—


[Jack and Ali laugh]


ALI: You would totally sweat! And then you’d just be drippy.


AUSTIN: This is the Depression, right? It’s all dusty and gross, eugh.


JANINE: Well, I mean, you wouldn’t like—if you were—this is World War II—


AUSTIN: Oh, okay.


JANINE: So if you going to the factory or whatever, you’d have a jumpsuit, you wouldn’t need your stockings. But if you’re going out—if you’re going out to hang out with some army guys—


AUSTIN: Going out dancing. 


ALI: Yeah, the hot bar!


JACK: The hot bar [chuckles].


JANINE: —At the army place, the bars I forget the name of that were just for army guys, then you’d put on your gravy browning and your best dress and—[pauses]


[Ali hums]


JACK: Wow.


JANINE: Dance the gravy train, which was the dance—it wasn’t the dance at the time.


JACK: Um, Austin [laughs], what is “Skillet - I want to live - video games music video”?


AUSTIN: I don’t know, I just—


JACK: Why am I looking at Lara Croft?


AUSTIN: Inspiration. 


JACK: Alright, let’s—


AUSTIN: Spring right here, here we go. 


JACK: Gamer Tech, gaming and more.


AUSTIN: Gaming and more.


JACK: Gamer Tech—


AUSTIN: Gamer Tech.


JACK: “I want to live” - Skillet unleashed. 


ALI: Art, you good?


ART: Well, whatever that is, it crashed Discord for me.


ALI: Art? 


JACK: Art?


AUSTIN: Art?


[Ali makes sad noise]


ART: Clicking that link crashed Discord. 


[Austin, Jack, and Ali laugh]


AUSTIN: Great. You know what? Good. 


ALI: Good. Good. 


JACK: It’s just—


JANINE: Discord can’t allow any competing gamer tech. 


ALI: What?


JANINE: They’re closing the fist, they can’t allow anything ‘cause it’s from someone named Gamer Tech.


JACK: This is a real—this is some real E3 trailer music that they’ve got going here, for real.


AUSTIN: I mean, that’s the game. That’s the song, rather. That’s the thing. That’s the Skillet playing.


JACK: No, I mean Skillet has effectively written a good E3—


AUSTIN: Oh, I see what you’re saying, yeah. Catch it in the Crackdown 3 trailer this coming E3. I still don’t believe that game is gonna come out this year. Or early next year, whatever. 


JACK: Oh, it said “Reach for the light” and Lara lit a flare, it was like—


JANINE: Nn.


JACK: —Who edited this?


JANINE: I don’t like that though, ‘cause she already has the light. 


AUSTIN: Reach with the light. 


JANINE: She’s reaching with the light.


AUSTIN: Yeah, that’s prepositional difference. 


JANINE: That’s inaccurate. 


AUSTIN: Mm-hm. Are we ready to do this thing?


ALI: Yeah.


JANINE: Good question. 


JACK: [laughing] Don’t want to finish watching “Skillet - I want to live - video games music video”?


AUSTIN: No, I think I’m okay.


JANINE: That thing only needs to be forty seconds long and it is three and a half minutes.


ALI: Mm.


JACK: I’ve been trying to write two minutes and twenty two seconds of a theme song, and let me tell you it’s amazing that anybody manages to write that. You know when you look at videogames and you’re like, “How are they—how amazing that someone manages to do that.”


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: The fact that music is longer than between four and fifteen seconds constantly amazes me.


[Austin and Janine laugh]


AUSTIN: I mean yeah, but like, most of—this song is just two—this song is just a minute of song repeated three times with different lyrics, Jack [laughs].


JACK: [laughing] Look, you still have to write a minute, Austin. 


AUSTIN: I getcha, it’s hard.


ART: Have you thought about just doing lyrics instead? Just—


AUSTIN: That’s what I do.


ART: Apparently, you write it down and—


JACK: Yeah.


AUSTIN: [laughing] Have you thought about getting somebody else to make your words sound really good? ‘Cause it worked out great for me! 


[Jack laughs] 


AUSTIN: I just need you to know that I was trying to type in—’cause I wanted to look at something that had to do with our last—last time y’all played together in Hieron. The name of the episode was “What Life Looks Like” but I forgot the episode after that was called “Slow Justice” and I started to type “Slow Justice” into my Google but I remembered, that’s not them, they’re not Slow Justice, and so I just continued writing “Slow...Jams”—


[Jack laughs]


AUSTIN: [laughing] And that Winter in Hieron 28: Slow Jams, not a thing. But what if it had been?


JACK: Do we have any slow jams related files?


AUSTIN: Oh, almost certainly. I was just—this was just in Google though, this was not even in my drive [laughs].


JACK: Oh, I see [laughs]. 


AUSTIN: This was just “The Best ‘90s Slow Jams, Keith Sweat, R Kelly, Aaliyah, Genuine”. That’s the top hit here, from DJ Marcus on Youtube, shoutouts to DJ Marcus on Youtube. Ah, we should go to time.is.


JACK: Let’s do it.


ART: Thirty-five?


AUSTIN: Thirty-five.


[pause, followed by claps]


AUSTIN: Mine skipped, but I think I got it. We should do one more just in case, forty-five.


[pause, followed by less-synchronized claps]


AUSTIN: [laughs] Well.


JACK: Hmm.


AUSTIN: We did that first one, that was probably alright.


[Ali laughs]


JANINE: It’s been like a year and a half since we recorded a podcast, it’s gonna happen, you know.


ALI: I just have something very topical to share that I immediately—


AUSTIN: Mm-hm.


ALI: I just saw it, I was scrolling.


AUSTIN: Wow.


JACK: Ohh, wow. 


[Ali laughing in background]


AUSTIN: You know, Foucault is right, you know. This is it, boom. Just tweet that shit from Friends_Table on Twitter. Okay, ready?


JACK: [deep, ominous voice] Explain how I cannot leave, it is not a prison.


[Ali laughs]


JACK: [normal voice] Alright, let’s go.




[musical interlude, 18:44]




AUSTIN [in character]: Hadrian, it’s a pleasure to meet you in person. [normal voice] And she like—


ART: Oh, hold on, let me wait for this dog-barking fiesta. 


AUSTIN: [laughs] Okay.


[dog barks in background]


ART: Mabel doesn’t like being on the same floor as me while I record, so to trick her into going for a walk we have to ring the doorbell so her territorial-ness overwhelms her distaste for the computer—


[Ali, Jack, and Janine laugh]


AUSTIN: Yeah, okay.


ART: —and she barking-ly runs downs the stairs.


AUSTIN: That makes perfect sense to me.


[Jess in the background: “Sorry!”]


AUSTIN: [laughs] Tell Jess it’s okay.


ART: [off-mic] It’s okay! It makes sense, that’s the solution to your problem!


[Ali laughs]


ART: She’s still mad, that little jerk.


[Ali laughs]


AUSTIN: Mabel?


ART: Yeah, she’s like “Woof, woof, woof.” 


AUSTIN: Aw.


ART: Like she hasn’t figured out there’s no one there yet, she hasn’t figured out that she’s been tricked. 


[Austin and Ali laugh]


ART: I’m sorry, where were we? 


AUSTIN: Being introduced. 


ART: Hm.


AUSTIN: You were saying you were Hadrian.


[musical interlude, 19:50]




JANINE: I think it is! I think a corndog is a hotdog. Here’s—maybe here’s an interesting—okay, here’s a factor that separates the hotdog discussion from a lot of these discussions.


AUSTIN: Are we recording, because we should be recording?


JANINE: Yes, I am recording.


AUSTIN: Okay, good. 


JANINE: I think a heart—a heartdog [laughs].


AUSTIN: [laughs] A heartdog, what’s a heartdog?


JANINE: A hotdog is partially defined by the percentage of heart meat in it—


AUSTIN: Nnm.


JANINE: —And partially defined by what you put on it, right? So if you’re putting the same things on a corndog as a hotdog, I think that helps it be more—be more of an authentic hotdog.


AUSTIN: Are people putting the same things on corndogs? I’ve never had a corndog.


JANINE: People put mustard on corndogs.


ART: Yeah, mustard and ketchup are both—


JANINE: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Okay.


JANINE: The archetypal corndog has a perfectly symmetrical squiggle of mustard. 


AUSTIN: Huh.


JANINE: So I think if you’re putting toppings on something in that way—I’m not saying that alone defines a hotdog. Because—


AUSTIN: Right.


JANINE: —There’s a lot of things people put mustard on. A pretzel is not a hotdog. But—


AUSTIN: But you’re—


JANINE: In addition to certain factors, like here’s a tube—here’s a long piece of meat.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: Here’s a bread, here is your condiments that are probably in the range of like, sweet things, sour things, hot things, vinegary things. 


AUSTIN: This is like the Berlin interpretation of rogue-like, where there is not a firm, necessary definition but there are high-value factors and low-value factors, and for you one high-value factor is condiment similarity.


JANINE: Yes.


AUSTIN: That like—


ART: Sure.


AUSTIN: That is a thing—you know, you check enough of those boxes and hey, it might as well be a hotdog.


ART: But like, only an animal would put relish on a corndog.


AUSTIN: Is that true?


JANINE: I think that’s just because relish needs to be contained. 


AUSTIN: But would you—


JANINE: Because it’s heavier and not very adhesive, so it would just fall off. 


AUSTIN: What if someone put—I don’t know how corndogs work at all. Could you put relish in a corndog?


JANINE: Wait, how do you not what a corndog—how corndogs work?


AUSTIN: I’ve never had a corndog. I’ve never had a corndog— 


JANINE: I mean, I’ve never eaten a corndog but I’m aware of its—you have meat and then you dip it in batter and then—


AUSTIN: Yeah, but I don’t know if there’s room inside of the batter—


ART: I’ve been to two state fairs this year so I’m the corndog expert on this call.


AUSTIN: But I don’t know if there’s like—is there room inside of the batter, could you somehow fit a relish inside?


JANINE: Okay, even if there is, hot relish is bad.


ART: Yeah, you would then have to fry that with the relish in it. 


JANINE: Hot relish is just like vomit.


AUSTIN: I don’t—I’ve never had relish in my—That’s not true; I’ve had relish but not since I was a little boy. Not since I was a child. So I could not tell you what relish tastes like. My dad loved relish and wanted me to eat relish and I tried it and hated it as a kid . I also hated mustard [Janine laughs] as a kid; I now like mustard, so maybe I would like relish these days, I probably would, but, like, I couldn’t tell you what hot relish soun—tastes like. I do not like the phrase that I just said. 


[Art laughs]


JANINE: It’s not—so it’s—the thing to know about—


AUSTIN: I don’t like the phrase “hot relish”.


JANINE: The thing about relish is that relish is a blend of sweet and sour tastes


AUSTIN: Okay. That sounds good. 


JANINE: But it is also—there is a slimy component to it and there is a chunky component to it. And hot things, when you warm something up, the taste is often less apparent than when it is cold. So, my problem with hot relish is purely that before I even get the taste of the relish, I get the feel of hot slimy stuff and then chunky stuff.


AUSTIN: Yeah, it’s like a texture problem. I’m with you on that.


JANINE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: We’ve had this discussion about textures. 


JANINE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Textures can ruin anything for me. 


JANINE: Oh yeah.


AUSTIN: There are tastes I like but cannot fuck with because texture.


ART: Um, I recommend that if you ever want to try relish, to get it in a full-on Chicago-style hotdog.


AUSTIN: Which has relish.


ART: Which has relish, along with other things. I think the package is very appealing, so you might—


AUSTIN: There’s so much in this thing! 


JANINE: Is it sweet relish, or like, dill relish?


ART: It is sweet relish—


AUSTIN: There’s a whole dill pickle, right?


ART: Yeah. 


JANINE: Okay.


ART: It’s yellow mustard, chopped onions, sweet relish, and entire pickle, and like, salt or something.


AUSTIN: What’s the bread?


JANINE: That sounds so good.


AUSTIN: Is it just a hotdog bun? Or a potato roll—


ART: It’s usually a poppy seed roll.


AUSTIN: Okay. Interesting. 


ART: Oh, there’s also peppers and tomatoes on that.


JANINE: Hmm.  


AUSTIN: Yeah, these look good. I also—


JANINE: Yeah, that seems great.


AUSTIN: I don’t think I’d want the tomatoes.


ART: I would—The first time, I would just do it like that. 


AUSTIN: The way they do it.


JANINE: Tomatoes on a hotdog can be pretty good. 


AUSTIN: This seems like so much. How do you even eat this?


ART: Carefully [Janine chuckles]. And over the boat.


AUSTIN: Yeah. 


JANINE: A thing I really hated about—so there’s a big hotdog culture in Denmark, it’s kind of dying down because other—a lot of vegan places and sandwich places and stuff have opened up and people tend to go for that sort of meal instead of hotdogs. But, there’s a big culture of like these really long, thin hotdogs with a whole bunch of stuff piled on them but they only—like, when I got one, they just gave it to me on a napkin that was not even as long as the bun, nevermind the hotdog that overextended the bun, and then there’s just a mess of stuff on it, so I’m walking down the street and I just had mustard-water dripping down my hand ‘cause, like, I didn’t—maybe this is on me for not just eating it beside the cart like a normal person but I wanted to go to my hotel room and watch TV, so I didn’t. 


ART: I think more than like, a little bit past the bun and the hotdog starts getting useless. Like, your footlong hotdog and your little bun, I have no interest in that.


AUSTIN: Yeah, none. Only if it’s very little. 


ART: Maybe half a bite—


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: Half a bite of extra—


AUSTIN: Yeah, I’m with you. More than a half a bite is—


JANINE: I don’t mind a full bite. Yeah. I don’t want it the other way around though.


AUSTIN: Here’s the thing: I would rather a second hotdog. 


JANINE: I don’t want bun at the end. Sorry, what?


AUSTIN: I would rather just have a second, smaller hotdog at that point. 


JANINE: No...that’s silly [laughs].


AUSTIN: I’m a two hotdog type of person anyway. 


JANINE: Imagine if when you went to get a hotdog—and you didn’t know this was gonna happen—but you order a hotdog, and the hotdog fits the bun perfectly, it’s perfectly lined up.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: But then they hand you this little tiny baby hotdog in addition to [laughs] the current hotdog. 


AUSTIN: That’s not what I’m saying, I’m not saying that. I’m saying if you give me the choice between a hotdog that goes over the edge or two hotdogs, I’ll eat two hotdogs. Right. Hi. We’re talking about hotdog length here and— 


JACK: About hotdog length?


AUSTIN: Yes. 


JACK: Yeah. Long as possible.


JANINE: How long over the bun do you think is acceptable for a hotdog?


JACK: How long over the bun…


JANINE: Yeah.


JACK: So it poking out of the both ends of the bun?


ART: Yeah. 


JANINE: Mm-hm, mm-hm. 


JACK: Hmm...You want a bit, right? 


AUSTIN: I don’t mind a bit. I don’t mind a little bit. A half-bite.


JANINE: [laughing] For a second, I thought you were asking, “You want a bit like, ‘You want this to be funny, right?’” 


[Austin laughs]


JACK: Oh, right, you want—[laughing]


JANINE: But I was like, “Well, you just ruined it!” [laughing]


JACK: [laughing] You’d like a comedy moment here with this hotdog. So, Austin, are you on Team “Not Really”.


AUSTIN: I’m on Team “A Little Bit”. A little bite. But like, here, I’m gonna put this image in here, and I hate it.


JACK: Okay [laughs]


AUSTIN: I hate this new image. 
  
JACK: Okay.


AUSTIN: I’m like, just give me a second hotdog at this point! Look at how far that is!


JACK: Right, no, that is a mistake.


AUSTIN: That’s three inches of additional dog! I’m not—


JANINE: Something about the bun—the like—[sighs]. There’s like a vestigial quality about that bun [Jack laughs], it doesn’t want to be there, no one wants it there, but it has to be there, and it just makes it look extra like, lewd or s—there’s a quality to this that’s really unsettling.


JACK: Mm.


ART: The lighting is really fucking—


JANINE: Yes!


ART: The lighting in the background—


JANINE: Yes.


AUSTIN: It’s bad. 


ART: —is doing this no favors. 


AUSTIN: It’s not. 


JANINE: This looks like a picture from the seventies.


[Austin and Janine laugh] 


JACK: Where did this picture come from?


AUSTIN: I did a search for “hot dog length”.


JACK: What is being learned from here?


JANINE: Austin bought a storage locker and this is in it. 


[Austin guffaws, Jack chuckles]


AUSTIN: [laughing] On this season of Serial.


[Janine laughs]


AUSTIN: Um—


ART: Oh my God, Austin, can we get you on Storage Wars? Is there like a thing we can do for that?


AUSTIN: I would love to. Just invent a new—I think it’s like if I ever go into, like, witness protection, I’ll go—I’ll become one of those people.


ART: I don’t think if you’re in witness protection they want you on TV.


JACK: You know, on television. 


ART: Yeah. 


JANINE: Mm-hm. 


AUSTIN: Hide in plain sight. See, but like, this thing is, look, too big. Too big.


ART: This guy over here is definitely not Austin Walker. 


JANINE: Yeah, that’s—that’s a lot like the hotdog you’ll get in Copenhagen. I’ve a picture of the hotdog that’s just upsetting. 


JACK: [sighing] Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Cut those edges off, that’s what I would do. I would cut them off. I would find a way to cut them off and then eat them with a fork.


JANINE: [skeptically] Mmm.


JACK: I feel like when it gets that big, what you’re having is an experience. At that point.


AUSTIN: That’s true. Or, I just want it on another nice bun. I don’t mind if it sticks out a little bit. But, at that point, I want a second bun.


JANINE: Here’s—okay.


AUSTIN: But I also don’t want all that stuff on it. That’s the thing, I couldn’t eat a second dog like this that has all this other stuff on it. That’s a lot of stuff. 


JANINE: Okay, but what if you cut this dog in half, right, and then you put the extra bun—you put it side-by-side but so the overlap-y part is beside the blunt end of the bun on the other one. You know what I mean? So it’s like they’re at opposite ends. So you have like, the bun end and the bare end, and the other one is the bare end and the bun end. And then you eat them together [laughs]


AUSTIN: I never understood the difference between a bun and a bear market; I never really figured it out. 


[Janine laughs]


AUSTIN: But okay, here’s a counterpoint, counterpoint, counterpoint. To show I am an adult, to show I am a man of reason here, I think that these look terrible. I don’t like inside of the—I want it to be—


JANINE: Those are—those look like carrots. 


AUSTIN: Okay, those are carrots [laughs sheepishly].


JANINE: Yeah, that’s carrots. Those are carrots [laughs]. 


JACK: Woah! It’s a blooming onion!


AUSTIN: Aw, look at that blooming onion! Yummy yummy, in my tummy. 


JACK: Wow. Can we go to another Outback? 


AUSTIN: Yeah, this is fine. Just a little tiny nubbin. I’m happy with a nubbin, I could live with a nubbin. I love a—okay, here’s what I like, I like a potato roll. A potato roll, I’ll eat by itself, fuck it. Put some butter on it.


JACK: A potato roll?


AUSTIN: A potato roll is a type of bread. It’s like a potato bread.


JACK: [with comprehension] Oh. 


AUSTIN: Like a potato roll. A potato roll?


JACK: Okay. 


ART: Bread made out of potato.


JACK: Sure. 


AUSTIN: I actually don’t know how much potato is in it.


ART: No one does.


[Jack laughs]


AUSTIN: See? It’s a mystery. 


JANINE: It’s probably one of those things where it’s like, you make potato flour, right, and then it’s just—it’s flour. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, sounds great.


JANINE: It’s mostly the starch part of the potato. 


ART: I think it’s the vodka of the bread world. 


AUSTIN: It’s a white bread but it’s like—it’s actually like, it’s extremely yellow—dye-yellow. It’s like—I mean, it has the toasted brown of like a hotdog bun but like the bottom of it, or whatever.


JACK: Potato roll...I’m looking at this. Oh, this thing looks great. 


AUSTIN: Well it’s not—you’re not gonna—it’s not [sighs]. My guess is the search for potato roll is not gonna give you what I’m talking about. 


JACK: Okay, I’m gonna Google “Legit potato roll”. 


AUSTIN: Mm, yeah, it sort of does. Potato bun is really what I’m talking about, you’re right. You’re right. But you can order those in like a hotdog roll. Let me see if I can get one of those...Oh my God, you’ve never had these—Oh my God, you’ve never seen like the Martin’s? Oh. Hold up, I’m gonna just—I should just bring these to Vancouver. Yeah, they’re so good. 


JACK: Oh wow, look at these!


AUSTIN: They’re just a perfect hotdog—they’re just a perfect—they’re just perfect.


JACK: Look at that cute packaging.


AUSTIN: I know, it’s very cute. It’s maybe the only cute packaging in America. So. Alright. We should do a clap.


ART: Y’all know about Pea Soup Andersen’s?


ALI: No.


JANINE: What? Hey, can you break down those words?


AUSTIN: Pea soup...Andersen’s.


JANINE: Into like separate…Pea Soup Andersen’s. 


ART: It’s this—there’re these two restaurants in the Central Valley of California.


JACK: Oh, Jesus.


ART: I think the only people who visit these restaurants are people going from Los Angeles to San Francisco or Bakersfield, or vice versa, I think it might be north of Bakersfield. It’s really nothing...maybe it’s by Fresno. I’m gonna level with you: between here and San Francisco, I’m really fuzzy on what’s out there. I know it’s a lot of farms.


ALI: [laughing] Okay. 


AUSTIN: Here you go, just click through on this one to see one of my—a Twitter friend of mine eating there earlier this year. I had like—You said it and I was like, wait, I’ve seen a person I know eat this soup this year [laughs]. 


JACK: Image one: person with a large sign behind them saying “Pea Soup Andersen’s”. 


AUSTIN: That’s right.


JACK: Image two: the same person standing next to frightening, life-sized plaster chef.


AUSTIN: Smaller.


JANINE: Smaller than life-size, I think.


AUSTIN: Probably smaller than life-size. 


JANINE: I mean, it could still be life-sized, but.


AUSTIN: That has to be Pea Soup Andersen, right?


JANINE: Mm-hm.


JACK: Right, right, right. Image three—


JANINE: No, that’s Flea Market Andersen, you see those everywhere. 


[Jack chuckles]


AUSTIN: Uh, yeah, right.


JACK: Image three: soup, soup. 


AUSTIN: Pea soup.


JACK: It looks—Yeah, pea soup. With some cutlery. 


AUSTIN: With bread. 


JACK: Bread. Image four: [laughs] the pea soup is gone. 


AUSTIN: So is the bread. But there’s a revelation here that I need to understand.


ALI: [laughing] Mm-hm. There’s a twist. 


AUSTIN: What do you think that is, Ali?


ALI: I think that that is a vanilla milkshake. 


AUSTIN: Me too. I also think—


ALI: That’s not something I would follow-up a warm bowl of soup and an entire loaf of bread with.


AUSTIN: Richard—


[Jack laughs]


JANINE: Sometimes you eat thick slurry and you want to follow it up with the drink of sweet slurry. 


ALI: You know [sigh].


AUSTIN: You know what I love is, in the next picture, in the next set of pictures of this friend of mine on the internet, there’s a picture with a robot in it, and that’s cool. I appreciate that. It’s like a wallpaper with like a Metal Gear or something on it. Looks good. Alright.


ART: My point is, I think the branding of Pea Soup Andersen’s looked like that package of potato buns.


ALI: Okay.


JACK: Okay.


AUSTIN: I’m sorry, there’s a third tweet in this thread [laughing], and it’s the same person saying, “Sorry about my bad laptop wallpaper.” [laughs more]


JANINE: Aw [laughs]


[Ali laughs]


AUSTIN: Now I feel bad about calling out.


JANINE: Owned.


ALI: No, it’s good!


AUSTIN: It’s good.


ALI: We were complimenting it.


AUSTIN: I was! I think it’s Metal Gear Sahelanthropus. 


ALI: Richard. Order a milkshake whenever you want. 


AUSTIN: You know what, yeah. Getchu want


JACK: Yeah. Follow up the soup with, uh, a milkshake [laughs].  


AUSTIN: Yum. Hot then cold. 


ALI: That’s how you like it. 


AUSTIN: That’s what I always say. 


JACK: Should we clap?


AUSTIN: We should clap.


ALI: [sighs] Maybe. 


JACK: I have a very creaky chair.


AUSTIN: Do you—


ALI: I just typed in clap.is [laughs].


AUSTIN: Clap.is.


ALI: Which we should absolutely buy. 


JACK: What is that?


ALI: It’s—I don’t know what it is. 


JANINE: We should just register that as a redirect to time.is. 


ALI: Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: Do you think Hideo Kojima decided that the mech—that the Metal Gear in Metal Gear Solid 5 should be called Sahelanthropus because it sort of sounds like “philanthropy”, which is the name of a different group in Metal Gear? 


ALI: Probably. 


AUSTIN: Okay.


JANINE: And also it sounds like A-Ha.


ALI: Hm?


JANINE: The band. 


AUSTIN: Sa-ha. Yeah. Sahelan—yeah, okay.


JANINE: Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: Good. Alright, ready?


JANINE: When?


AUSTIN: Forty-five.


JANINE: Okay.


[pause, followed by claps]


AUSTIN: That sounded good to me.


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: We got that all warmed up, you know? We’re ready to go.


[Ali giggles]


AUSTIN: I need my notes, which—I was going to get up but then we instead did that whole bit [laughs].


ALI: Time.is time? I mean, um, Roll20 time?


AUSTIN: Roll20 time, yeah, yeah, yeah. 


JACK: Ali, are you okay?


ALI: Yeah? In what way?


JACK: You just had clap.is [Ali and Austin laugh], and you had time.is time. 


[Ali giggles wildly]




[musical interlude, 35:43]




AUSTIN: [exhales] So, who’s on this fishing trip?


JANINE: I went to a boat name generator and I just want to say it’s, uh—


JACK: [typing] Boat...name...generator. 


ART: Yep, uh-huh.


JANINE: Some of these, not good. Galax-sea, like galaxy but without the ‘y’, but then sea.


ALI: Oh.  


AUSTIN: [negative noise]


JANINE: Just driftin’, with an apostrophe. 


ART: Awesome.


JANINE: Daydream 2, Hopscotch. Bowndless Pleasure, but there’s a ‘W’ instead of a ‘U’ in boundless for some reason.


JACK: These are all the horses in the Bluff City horse race [Ali and Janine laugh].


AUSTIN: Uh-huh. Liquid Qlean, but clean with a ‘Q’ [laughs]


JANINE: [laughs] What?


JACK: Optimality. 


ART: Wait, where’s the ‘Q’? It’s in the ‘C’? 


AUSTIN: Yeah. Uh-huh.


ART: I don’t like that.


JANINE: Nmm. 


JACK: Are we looking at namegenerator.business?


[Ali laughs]


JACK: Okay.


JANINE: Blue Chip. [whispers] What does that mean? Is that a reference?


JACK: I’m so excited.


AUSTIN: Here’s one. This one is Viagrabond. It’s like ‘vagabond’ but with ‘viagra’ at the top.


ALI: Oh, sure.


JACK: Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.


AUSTIN: That’s what I said. 


JANINE: Advisory. That’s just a word.  


JACK: Hey, uh—


AUSTIN: Smelly Cat [laughs]


JANINE: Nmm. 


AUSTIN: Chief Enthusiast. Also a Bluff City role. Someone has to play a chief enthusiast [Ali giggles].


JACK: I, uh, there’s a pseudonym name generator in the left-hand column and  I just generated some pseudonyms, and there are some great Bluff City names in here. Wendell Pathenbarger, Laurie Dufrein. Helaine Toto. [laughs] Star Magazino. 


[Austin laughs loudly, Art, Ali, Jack, and Janine all join in]


AUSTIN: That is the best Unusual Suspects name I have ever heard. [deep voice] “Oh, so what was your source called?” [nervous voice] “Uh, Star...Magazine-o [Ali laughs]. Star Magazino.”


JANINE: We need to do a Hieron/Bluff City crossover, or like AU episode. It’s like everyone—it’s Swordtown but it’s Bluff City, and Star Magazino is exactly who you’d think. 


JACK: Oh, God.


AUSTIN: Oh, God. 


JACK: God. 


ART: Bluff Swordtown.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


JACK: Imagine, if we go in the sword and it was fucking Bluff City.


[Ali and Janine laugh]


JACK: It’d be the worst.


AUSTIN: I just got Hamilton Schlock on this pseudonym generator, which feels like it’s editorializing. Um—


JANINE: Oh, hey! This is a fun lawyer-boat name that just generated. Motion Sustained!


AUSTIN: There you go.


ALI: Ooh.


ART: Ayy. 


JANINE: That’s what boats do. 


AUSTIN: That is what—That’s pretty good. That’s pretty good! 


JANINE: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Alright, who’s on this boat trip? We don’t have a lot of time today.




[musical interlude, 38:34]




AUSTIN: Alright, I am good to keep going, we have one more year we need to do before whatever, but I’m also good to end, it’s up to y’all.


JACK: I don’t kn—


ART: I think we were supposed to end in fifteen minutes, we do not have enough—


AUSTIN: Wait who’s ending in fifteen—I was the one who gave the nine-thirty originally, right?


JACK: No, uh, I—


AUSTIN: Or did you also give a nine-thirty?


JACK: Yeah, well, Kat and I are going to stream some Silent Hill 2—


AUSTIN: Oh, gotcha.


JACK: —In a couple of hours, but I want to have some dinner before then.


AUSTIN: Totally. Ali, are we good for another episode at this point?


ALI: Yeah, one and two are done.


AUSTIN: Okay, cool. Alright.


JACK: Should we do a clap?


ALI: Yeah.


AUSTIN: We should do a clap.


JACK: I’ve never played Silent Hill 2 before, so I’m interested to see what this is.


AUSTIN: Enjoy.


ALI: It slaps.


AUSTIN: It’s a lot. It’s a lot.


ALI: It fucking slaps.


AUSTIN: It’s the one I would recommend, it’s the one I think is—yeah, yeah. It’s wild.


ALI: It fucking slaps. The beginning of it s—if you’re playing it for an hour, you gonna be like, “This is tight.”


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.


ALI: And then, maybe after that hour, you don’t think so, but—[laughs] 


JACK: I love that you and Austin gave [laughs] very different reasons—


AUSTIN: I’ll tell you this: it’s my favorite of those games—


JACK: Okay.  


AUSTIN: But Ali really likes 1 and 3 a lot, I know, and I really like 2, and there’s a divide inside of the fandom about what are the good ones. 


JACK: Hmm.


AUSTIN: But, Ali’s right, it fucking slaps [Jack laughs]. It is also a fucking lot and I wouldn’t want to play it at night, so.


ALI: Mm-hm. 


JACK:Oh, damn. I’m excited! 


AUSTIN: I’m a coward.


JACK: Is it a scary game?


ALI: Oh, a little bit.


AUSTIN: Yeah, don’t worry about it [Ali laughs]. 


JACK: Okay. Okay, alright, fine.


ART: There’s a lot of metaphor in there.


AUSTIN: Oh, yeah.


JACK: Oh, okay. Okay. 


ALI: Ooh boy howdy [giggles]


AUSTIN: Yikes. 


ALI: Ten?


AUSTIN: Fuck. Yeah, ten.


[pause, followed by claps]


AUSTIN: Okay.


JACK: God, a good clap.


ALI: Ooh.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm.


ALI: Oh, hey. 


JACK: I’ll get that uploaded tonight.  


AUSTIN: Sounds good.


ALI: Yeah, that would be good. Oh, I have to digitally pack for this fucking trip [laughs]. 


AUSTIN: I know. Well, this ep won’t be—


ALI: No, no, no, yeah.


AUSTIN: This is for Ep Three, right?


ALI: Yeah, yeah.


AUSTIN: Okay.


ALI: Yep.


JACK: I’m gonna hopefully get—I’m gonna try and get a theme to you tomorrow. 


AUSTIN: Hell yeah. 


ALI: Okay. That would be great.


AUSTIN: What is this—What did I name this?


ART: Aubade—


JANINE: Aubade, number, name.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: Make a new folder. 


AUSTIN: Mm-hm. Um [typing]. I’ll see everybody in a few days.


JACK: Yeah.


JANINE: Yeah.


ALI: Mm-hm.


JACK: Except Art.


AUSTIN: No, what? It’ll also still be a few days. 


JANINE: That’s still a few days [Ali laughs]. Just a different few. 


ALI: Art’s Thursday, Jess is Friday, right?


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: Yeah.


ALI: Okay. 


ART: But Jack has a very strict wall on what a few days is.


JACK: Oh, yeah.


AUSTIN: Wait, what is your wall? It’s not three?


JACK: A few days will take us to Wednesday. 


ART: Two days, two days is Jack’s wall. 


AUSTIN: Two is a couple, three is a few! 


JACK: Okay. What’s four?


AUSTIN: Several. 


JACK: A few.


AUSTIN: I think four—five is several. Three/four is a few. One is one, two is a couple, three is a few.


ALI: Four days is basically a week! [laughs]


[Jack laughs]


AUSTIN: [incredulous] Four days is not basically a week.


ART: Monday through Thursday, that’s a week for Ali! 


ALI: Yeah! Monday through Thursday is not a week for you? You’re already over the hump.


ART: We still have—


JACK: There’s still some days to go, Ali.


ALI: Yeah, but those don’t count. 


AUSTIN: Mmm. 


[Ali laughs]


AUSTIN: We record—we work on the weekend, often. 


ALI: I know, but. In terms of the passage of time.


JACK: We’d still be in, like, 1530 or something if we cut out that many days in the week [laughs].


AUSTIN: That sounds good, actually.


JACK: 1530? Fucking sucked.


AUSTIN: No, I’m saying, like, cutting out more days of the week, I don’t know. 


JACK: Oh, yeah, the four-day week.


AUSTIN: No, it’d be bad, ‘cause then what would you do—Well no, okay, four-day week, two days week, two-day weekend, love it.


ALI: I just mean like, in terms of an amount of time I would like, expend some Wait Mate to—which is a reference you probably all don’t get—


AUSTIN: Uh-uh.


ALI: It would be [laughing] three—


AUSTIN: Excuse me? Some what?


ALI: —days no, four days yes, and Wait Mate is a Tim and Eric sketch—


AUSTIN: I knew it was, I knew it was, I knew it had to be. I knew it had to be. 


[Ali dissolves into laughter]


AUSTIN: I knew it had to be. How could it not be?


JACK: What was the reference that you made?


ALI: Anyway, it’s a pill that you take to, like—if you’re anticipating a thing in a couple days, you just take it and you sleep for the entire time.


AUSTIN: It’s a Wait Mate. Like a thing—


ALI: A Wait Mate.


AUSTIN: Like a friend, like a waiting friend. 


ALI: Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.


AUSTIN: Jeff Goldblum. 


JACK: But it’s a sedative.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Like a sedative.


ALI: [laughing] And four days is enough days to wait! Like, that’s a lot of days! Is the point I’m trying to make.


[Wait Mate video clip: Powerful….]


AUSTIN: You wouldn’t Wait Mate for three days? [Video: “Prime Minister Goldblum, thank you, sir”] I would Wait Mate for a day sometimes.


JACK: If I could skip forty to sixty minutes [laughs].


AUSTIN: If I could skip tomorrow, I’d be golden, honestly.


ALI: Oh yeah, that’s true. 


AUSTIN: Like I have—yeah. 


ALI: We have things to do tomorrow.


AUSTIN: I have so much stuff to do tomorrow. I gotta go to Target.
