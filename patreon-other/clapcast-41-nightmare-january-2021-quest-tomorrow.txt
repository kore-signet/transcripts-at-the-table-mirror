Clapcast 41: Nightmare! (January 2021) + Quest tomorrow!
Transcriber: thedreadbiter, Jess (JortsMachoooo#6341)
[Audio begins]
JANINE: (Laughing) Yeah.
ALI (overlapping): Yeah.
AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah. Right.
ALI: Isn’t Discord already like—is willing to, uh…
AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah. Like, yeah.
ALI (overlapping): ...report to the authorities, yeah…
AUSTIN (overlapping): They—they keep local recording—not recordings—they keep local text logs on everything and will hand those over, so...if you ever wanna do crime, don’t do it on Discord.
ALI (overlapping): Ew...ah...
ART: Or do it in a voice call.
AUSTIN: I don’t trust them not to be recording this.
ART: Mm...
ALI: Hm...
AUSTIN: They have higher-quality backups than us. [JANINE laughs] If we ever need the show… [laughs] If we ever lose anybody, [ALI laughs in the background] you just gotta call Discord up and be like hey, can you send us…
ALI: [laughing] Oh my god, that would be amazing.
AUSTIN: No! [laughs]
JANINE (overlapping): You just have to make sure—[ALI screams and laughs] you just have to make sure you trigger their—their AI...intel—whatever the fuck. Their learning machine to, like,  start recording. So if we ever need a backup then we just have to say, like, “crime crime crime” over and over again really fast and…
ALI: I’m committing a felony. Here’s this felony I wanna commit.
[JANINE laughs]
AUSTIN: God…
ART (overlapping): That’s how criminals talk.
[ALI laughs]
JANINE: Yeah. I mean, it’s—it’s like AI stuff, so it’s like Phasmaphobia, right, like you just have to say—you just have to say “Hunt, kill, hunt, kill” and then it’ll…
AUSTIN: And then it’ll…
ALI: Ohhh…
JANINE: (Laughing) And then it’ll kick in…
ART (overlapping): Crime crime crime!
[AUSTIN laughs]
ALI: And then Discord’s ghost will show up.
AUSTIN: (Laughing) Michael Anderson!
[JANINE laughs]
ALI: Mm…
JANINE: God, what was that one that we had—
AUSTIN (overlapping): Oh, it was tw— 
JANINE: —to bounce on that was like—it was like the …
AUSTIN (overlapping): It was like Thomas—it was like the same name twice.
JANINE (overlapping): I think it was Thomas Thomas, yeah.
AUSTIN: (laughing) Thomas Thomas!
JANINE: God, that would’ve been good.
AUSTIN: I’m so mad we didn’t get Thomas Thomas. (Laughing) Tom-tom.
ALI: [Laughs quietly] I still haven’t played that, I wanna play that.
AUSTIN (overlapping): We should play that, it’s so good.
JANINE: It’s very good.
AUSTIN: Art, have you gotten your new computer yet?
ALI (overlapping): Let’s just do that.
ART: No, it’s not gonna be here ‘til Christmas.
AUSTIN: Damn...
ALI: Wow…
AUSTIN (overlapping): Owned. 
ART: Yeah.
AUSTIN: That sucks. [Laugh]
ALI: What did you end up doing? Did you end up just getting like a new one altogether or an exchange or…
ART: No, Dell refunded me and I got one from Falcon Northwest.
AUSTIN: Mm...
ALI: (Awestruck) Falcon Northwest…
ART: A fancy bird computer company.
JANINE: I was gonna say, yeah—
ALI (overlapping): Wowee…
JANINE (overlapping): —it’s bold of you to be like, fuck PCs, I’m getting a bird. [Laugh]
[AUSTIN and ALI laugh]
ART: This bird knows so many ones and zeroes!
[All laugh]
AUSTIN: Ah…
ALI: That sounds good for the show. We should have—we should have more um, bird...stunts in our show. We should get more birds for it.
AUSTIN: We did. We were very high on bird stunts.
ALI (overlapping): Yeah.
AUSTIN: I guess this last arc had bird stunts in it!
SYLVIA: Yeah!
AUSTIN: This last Bluff arc.
ALI: Yeah.
AUSTIN: And Hieron had all those bird people.
SYLVIA: And Fero frequently turned into a bird.
ART (overlapping) And then Kalar...
AUSTIN (overlapping): And Kalar! Kalar did bird stunts yesterday!
SYLVIA (overlapping): We have a lot of bird stunts on the show, actually!
ALI (overlapping): Kalar, yeah.
AUSTIN: Yeah, we’re a big bird show!
ALI (overlapping): Yeah...
SYLVIA: I’m glad!
ALI: I think there might be bird stunts in season 7…
AUSTIN: See? I’m so mad about…
ART (overlapping): I’ve finally been getting into that book, and it is…
SYLVIA: Oh, and we did, um, Beak, Feather and Bone, too.
AUSTIN: That’s all bird people!
ALI: All bird stuff.
AUSTIN: When have we not done bird stuff? Has there ever been a non—a no-bird season? Did Marielda have any birds?
ART: Well, I think we’re giving Counter/WEIGHT a lot of bird credit that it might not bird-deserve.
[AUSTIN, ALI, and ART laugh]
AUSTIN: No… 
ALI (overlapping): Birdserve, wait…[laugh]
AUSTIN (overlapping): ...there’s the vulture. There’s the “Righteousness is a fucking vulture” line—that’s a bird.
ART: Yeah, but that’s [stammers] that’s not actually a bird.
AUSTIN: Are we sure? Have we received Righteousness—we never opened up the briefcase. [ART laughs] God, what a good shot that would be, actually, is just you open up the briefcase and it’s just like...a vinyl bird. It’s just like, it’s nothing. [ALI laughs] [Sigh]
ART: It’s a Funko Pop of a bird.
[SYLVIA, JANINE and ALI laugh]
AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah, it’s a Funko Pop of a bird, laying on its side.
[ALI and AUSTIN laugh]
JANINE: Funko Pop Maltese Falcon.
AUSTIN: Uh-huh. [Sighs in amusement]
JANINE: I actually— 
ART: Oh my god— 
JANINE: If they did that, I might buy that Funko Pop, I bet that’d be—some of that—some of them look okay.
ART (overlapping): Well, no, you have to only make one of them.
JANINE: (Doubtful) Eh…
ART: You have to make your Funko Pop Maltese Falcon very rare and valuable.
AUSTIN: Right.
ART: That’s what the Maltese Falcon is about.
JANINE (overlapping): No, but that’s—but that’s the Funko Pop illusion, right, is (mockingly) they’re all rare and valuable eventually.
AUSTIN: Mm-hm.
JANINE: That’s why you make a wall of them in your house and you invest all your savings in your Pops.
AUSTIN: (Typing) Um…
ART:  But yes, you’re right, a Maltese Falcon would be great.
AUSTIN: That’d be so funny. Um…
ART: Do they have, like, a tip line?
AUSTIN: Also, wait, we have to double check, because (typing) “Funko Pop Maltese Falcon”... No, of course… 
JANINE (overlapping): I don’t think they’ve been getting into noir shit.
AUSTIN: Are you sure? Oh, there’s definitely some sort of…uh…there’s definitely some sort of...like…
SYLVIA: You could probably find a custom—
AUSTIN: Right.
SYLVIA: —a custom one, y’know.
JANINE (overlapping): Oh yeah, yeah.
AUSTIN: We could get Run Button Courtney to make us one.
ALI: Mm...
AUSTIN: She makes custom Funko Pops.
ART: I assumed.
ALI: Does she?
AUSTIN: [Laughing slightly] She does.
ART: I want just a weird bird.
AUSTIN: (Laughing) Right? [ALI laughs] Ah…
ART: But it must be hard, ‘cause like most Funko customs must start with a—[stammers] they must just be repaints, right?
AUSTIN: Probably, right?
ART: So like, it’s not gonna look like a bird.
JANINE (overlapping): It depends on…I mean, you can sculpt it to look like a—I mean, I think you could actually do a pretty decent job, like, I…
AUSTIN: There are birds.
JANINE: I...yeah. Um. A lot of it is gonna be like adding clay and stuff—not clay but like certain kinds of—I forget what it’s called, is it epoxy sculpt that people use for this stuff? But you would, like, tack that on and then sort of carve it out. I’ve seen people do some real wild shit with like Monster High dolls and stuff, and I think it would be similar—similar material.
AUSTIN: That’s a bird.
ALI: Mm, mm-hm.
AUSTIN: This is technically a bird.
SYLVIA: I hate that bird.
JANINE: Yeah, that’s—what is that from? What’s Orange Bird?
AUSTIN: You know, Orange Bird.
ALI: It’s like a Disneyland thing.
ART (overlapping): Orange Bird.
JANINE: What?
AUSTIN: Orange Bird.
SYLVIA: Yeah, it—I, that—there is a Disneyland thing on there, so, I’m willing to believe.
AUSTIN (overlapping): Is Orange Bird from a racist thing?
ART: I would guess that Orange Bird—I mean, this is a hundred percent guess, is from the Tiki Room?
AUSTIN: You’re—okay, keep going, that’s one correct thing.
ALI: Uh, (reading) the Orange Bird is a character created by Disney for the Florida Citrus Commission...
AUSTIN: Uh-huh.
[SYLVIA laughs]
ALI: —as a mascot, and has been predominantly featured—that’s not the right word. [Laughs] Feature character in Magic Kingdom’s Adventureland at the Sunshine Tea Terrace—Tree Terrace.
ART: Oh!
ALI: And the Enchanted Tiki Room.
AUSTIN: Yeah, so in the Enchanted Tiki…
JANINE (overlapping): Oh, I have—hang on, I have a character description—sorry, Austin, go on with the thing you were gonna say? 
AUSTIN (overlapping) Florida—the—it was made in exchange for the Florida Citrus Commission…
JANINE:(overlapping) Or don’t. Did I get disconnected?
AUSTIN: Uh…
ART: No, we can hear you.
AUSTIN (overlapping): ...we can hear you. 
ALI: No, hi.
ART: Can you not hear Austin?
AUSTIN: She cannot hear us. Or me? [Typing]
ART: Big Bird would make a better Maltese Falcon than Orange Bird—
AUSTIN: Yes. 
ART: —while we’re waiting for (laughing) Janine to come back.
ALI: Yeah.
AUSTIN: Um. Uh, (reading) Florida Citrus Commission...in exchange for the design of Orange Bird, sponsored the Enchanted Tiki Room.
ALI: Ooh.
ART: So it’s probably not present in the California Tiki Room.
AUSTIN: Presumably not…
ART (overlapping) Much like the California…
ALI (overlapping): I think it is, because they sell a ton of that merchandise at...Disneyland. I’ve seen Orange Bird around.
ART: Mm.
AUSTIN: Merchandise can be found at both, and in 2004 it was featured at Tokyo Disneyland.
ALI: Oh…
AUSTIN: But it doesn’t look like there’s like…
JANINE: I’m back.
AUSTIN: Welcome back.
ART: Hey!
JANINE: I think...
ART: We can hear you.
JANINE (overlapping): Did you read the sad fact about Orange Bird?
AUSTIN: No, what was the sad fact?
JANINE: Um, says...so (reading) the Orange Bird is a sunny little fellow with an orange for a head and green leaves for wings. Unable to utter a sound, the Orange Bird makes his cheery thoughts appear above his head in puffs of orange smoke.
AUSTIN: Okay, that’s...
ART: Oh, they definitely don’t have that in California.
[ALI laughs]
AUSTIN: Uh, there’s also this one. Which I think…
JANINE: Ew!
ALI: Mm...
AUSTIN: Is… 
JANINE: No!
AUSTIN: ...really walking the line…[laughs]
ART: This is racist!
JANINE: No….
AUSTIN: (laughing) Yeah!
[ALI chuckles]
JANINE: ‘Cause that’s not a beak!
AUSTIN: No… It’s not.
JANINE (overlapping): Like there’s no way you can convince me that’s a beak.
AUSTIN: They had a bunch of minstrel Funko Pops—
JANINE (overlapping): What the fuck.
[ALI laughs in the background]
AUSTIN: —and they were like, “we gotta do something, we cannot sell these!”
ART: They put an Orioles hat on it? Like— 
AUSTIN: Well, I mean, the Orioles mascot—this is the problem, is that the Oriole mascot cartoon, very clearly a bird, right?
ART: Mm-hm. That’s a bird.
AUSTIN: But…
ALI (overlapping) Sure.
JANINE (overlapping): It’s sideways.
AUSTIN: But there…
JANINE (overlapping): What does this look like on the side?
AUSTIN: Well, the side is not the problem. The side is—[stammers] the thing is that front-on, yeah...
ART: Oof! Oof!
ALI (overlapping) Yeah.
AUSTIN (overlapping): (Laughing) Front-on, it’s not good.
ALI: Yeah…
AUSTIN: And— 
ART: I don’t like it.
AUSTIN: —especially front-on and far away?
ALI (overlapping): Yeah.
JANINE (overlapping): Yeah [laughs].
[ART and ALI laugh]
AUSTIN: The further away you get… 
[ALI and ART laugh in the background]
JANINE: Oh…
AUSTIN: ...the worse it gets.
ART: You know, most people in the baseball stadium are [AUSTIN laughs] further away than all of these photos.
ALI: Mm-hm.
SYLVIA (overlapping): It looks like, um, what’s—I think his name’s Globox or something, from Rayman? Does anybody know that guy?
JANINE: Oh, yeah!
ALI (overlapping): Globox...
JANINE: The big one? The big thing?
SYLVIA: The blue guy, yeah, Rayman’s friend.
AUSTIN (overlapping) Oh, the big blue guy! Yeah, you know what, that makes me like him more. Globox is all right!
ALI: Yeah…
JANINE: Is he?
AUSTIN: I don’t know. There’s one more bird that I found here. Uh, one more bird—and that, of course, is Larry Bird.
SYLVIA: Oh god.
ALI: Mm. Mm-hm.
AUSTIN: The moustache that looks like a sad mouth is very funny, to me.
JANINE (overlapping): Euh…[laughs]
SYLVIA: It makes sense for Larry Bird.
AUSTIN: Yeah.
ART: Do they know they could have gone for non-moustache Larry Bird?
AUSTIN: No, they couldn’t, they had to do this.
[ALI laughs]
ART: They had to do it to him.
AUSTIN: (Laughing) They HAD to do it to him!
JANINE (overlapping): Do you think there’s a Funko Pop customizer who specializes in fixing the eyes and only fixing the eyes?
AUSTIN: Probably.
ART: Wouldn’t it be worse if they looked like human eyes, though?Like— ‘cause they’re still really big.
[JANINE laughs]
ALI: Isn’t that the appeal?
JANINE (overlapping): Yeah…Hm?
ALI: Isn’t that like the appeal for Funko Pops?
AUSTIN: [Sighs] Maybe.
JANINE: I just—I don’t know, I…ugh....
ALI: It’s not good.
ART (overlapping): No one can tell you the appeal of a Funko Pop.
[ALI laughs]
AUSTIN: You have to see it for yourself.
ART (overlapping): The Bart Simpson raven one is pretty good.
AUSTIN: Yeah, Bart  —this is like the first— 
ALI (overlapping) Oh, sure.
AUSTIN: —every once in a while you see a Funko Pop that is like, if they just made these ones it would be okay. Y’know?
JANINE: I think in general, the face… design—the face concept almost always works better with animals than people. Like, if you show me an animal-based Funko Pop and then a person-based Funko Pop…
AUSTIN: Right.
JANINE: ...I would bet like 99 times out of 100, the animal-based Funko Pop is gonna look like something I might consider owning and putting in a place where I would have to look at it.
AUSTIN: Right. The toucan might be a good mold to start from.
ART (overlapping): That’s a good start, yeah. You need to change the posture a little bit.
AUSTIN: Yeah. You could do that.
JANINE (overlapping): He should look less arrogant.
AUSTIN: [Laughs] Yeah. Maltese Falcons are very…
JANINE (overlapping) Did that toucan go to Comic Con? What is—[AUSTIN laughs] why is it wearing a Comic Con t-shirt?
ALI: Yeah, that’s probably one of the exclusives.
ART (overlapping): Yeah, it’s the 50 years of Comic Con…toucan.
JANINE (overlapping): (Laughing) Toucan!
AUSTIN: (Laughing) Classic. Everyone’s favorite. All right.
ALI: This feels like the most Kalar-able.
AUSTIN: Oh, this is a Kalar bird. For sure.
ALI: Yeah...
AUSTIN: Just put a Millenium Break logo on that t-shirt. [SYLVIA and ALI laugh] Kalar at the Comic Con. [ART laughs] Getting the Millie oneshot.
SYLVIA: Oh my god!
ALI: God…
AUSTIN: We should do a clap and do a podcast.
SYLVIA: We should.
ALI: Yeah.
JANINE: Mm-hm.
ALI: Time.is. 
AUSTIN: Time DOT is.
ALI: 56.
AUSTIN: Yep.
[Pause, scattered claps]
SYLVIA: I missed it.
ART: I’ve had better claps.
ALI: [Laughs] So we can do another one at the top of the minute.
AUSTIN: All right. Sounds good.
[Pause, claps]
SYLVIA: For some reason I heard you say 56? [ALI laughs] So I was really confused.
AUSTIN (overlapping) Yeah, I also heard that, and I was like “There’s no way that that’s what she meant, she must have said—” yeah.
ALI: [Laughs] Do we need to do another clap?
SYLVIA: No, I got the…
AUSTIN (overlapping): No, this one was good, this one was good.
ALI (overlapping): Okay, okay, okay. [Laughs] I wasn’t sure if you missed it, because you were...[laugh]
SYLVIA: No no no, I’m good.
ALI: [Laughs] Okay.
JANINE: Quote today sucks.
SYLVIA: It’s bad.
ALI: Does it? I didn’t even re— 
JANINE (overlapping): Get fucked…
ALI: —I didn’t even go all the way down there, it’s so far down.
JANINE: Yeah, they should put the quote above the cities. IMO.
ALI: Mm.
ART: Above the cities! Wow.
AUSTIN: Oh, bad quote. All right.
[Scene cut sound cue]
[TIMESTAMP 00:12:41]
JANINE: I mean, you know, Jane Grey had it worse, so…
JACK: Twelve days, baby! Was it twelve days? 
JANINE: Yeah...
JACK: It was something like that, right?
JANINE: ...something like that.
AUSTIN: Prefer twelve years to twelve days, I guess. Yeah, fair enough.
[JANINE laughs, pause]
JANINE: Take what you can get.
AUSTIN: Yeah.
JACK: In my mind, this place—
JANINE (overlapping): The magnetic like...ugh—sorry, what were you going to say, Jack?
JACK: Oh, just in my mind like Neivel…Neivelmarch? 
AUSTIN: Mm-hm.
JACK: Uh, has like…
JANINE (overlapping): (Laughing) It’s Neivelmarch now.
JACK: ...has, like, kings in the same way that, um, like pre-unification Italy had like local rulers—
AUSTIN (overlapping): Right. Yes.
JACK: —where it’s like, oh, this is the person in charge of Piedmont or this is the person in charge of, like, Florence.
JANINE: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
AUSTIN: I thought about introducing, like, the leader, but I didn’t know if they were a mayor or a duke or what. So I just bypassed that person by saying I got the paperwork in order but I was going to [JACK laughs] like write a letter to the leader with all of the documents or whatever. I was like, “I need to say it happened.” Um. This company exists now, I have a charter from whoever needed to sign the charter. [Chuckle]
JANINE: I feel like the leader should be some sort of, like, horrific mountain man.
AUSTIN: Yeah? [JACK laughs] That’s fun.
JANINE: But also I could just be biting this from Hilda, which has—in the early arc there’s like a king, and the king is just like in a tiny castle in the mountains all alone. But I love that! [Laugh] 
[14:06]
JACK: We have some great regional leaders in the Grand Tableau. There’s that guy who’s made of anchors. Did he survive or—
AUSTIN (overlapping): No, he’s not—[stammers] Fall of Magic is not Grand Tableau.  
JACK: Really? 
AUSTIN: It’s two different Grand Tableau.
ALI (overlapping): Oh...[laughs]
JANINE: Wow!
ALI: Um...
AUSTIN: I don’t wanna touch it, like it’s too—also, the continuity is just weird because it was the way that game ends, like maybe—
ALI (overlapping): Sure...
JANINE: Is that the—
AUSTIN (overlapping): Yes, correct.
JANINE: —is that the, like, experimental indie mobile game that the studio that made Grand Tableau made, like, between projects [JACK laughs] to be like—
AUSTIN (overlapping): Or... 
JANINE: —”We can do other stuff!” And the answer was like “Nah, no one likes this, but it’s cool.”
AUSTIN: Or, is it the 1.0 to Grand Tableau’s Realm Reborn. 
[JANINE and ALI chuckle]
JACK: Oh!
JANINE: Oh, sure!
AUSTIN: You know?
JACK: Well, but in the weird reverse version where 1.0 was really good, and they rebooted it for some reason.
AUSTIN: People—some people loved 1.0, is all I’ll say. 
JACK: I’m sure that in his heart, Yoshida liked 1.0. 
AUSTIN: Yeah.
JACK: He clearly saw enough in it to go...
AUSTIN: Have you seen that clip of Yosh—[stammers] Yoshiba saying um...god, what is the—what is the context of it? Oh, setting up 1.0 servers. Whether or not he would ever set up 1.0 servers. Like Blizzard—or, like—
JACK: [Laughs] Like a—like Blizzard had done—
AUSTIN (overlapping) —like Blizzard did with—yeah, have you not seen this clip? 
JACK: No, what does he say? Does he just say it’s a bad game? 
AUSTIN (overlapping): I’m gonna link it—I’m linking it in Gamer Nation. 
[Pause, typing sounds]
AUSTIN: (Quietly) Um...
[Quiet laughing]
JACK: [Laugh] He’s just cracking up. 
[ALI laughs]
[Silence]
JANINE: (Laughing) Oh, God...
AUSTIN: [Laugh] It’s so good!
[ALI bursts out laughing, others join in]
JANINE: Even...doesn’t even need a translator to know what’s going on—
AUSTIN (overlapping): He doesn’t
JANINE: —right? Like, just...
AUSTIN: Yeah...
JANINE: No...
[Continued laughter]
JACK: A nightmare!
AUSTIN: (In a posh accent) Nightmare! [ALI laughs] It’s so good!
ALI: Oh, man...
JANINE: [Laughs] My god...
ALI: The, like, the little wince when he first pulls—
AUSTIN (overlapping): (Laughing) Yes!
ALI: —his hand away from his face to sit up. Oh, that feeling when....
AUSTIN (overlapping) He immediately knows that the question is coming.
JACK (overlapping): So close to losing it as well...yeah.
[ALI laughs] 
AUSTIN: He’s like, “Great...” [indiscernible]
JACK (overlapping): That’s a great response. 
AUSTIN: Oh it’s so good.
JANINE (overlapping): So good... 
JACK: I saw some maps of—of the Black Shroud and of—maybe Mor Dhona? Like, the areas that are in the game now, but were in 1.0? And, it’s just chaos to watch them.
AUSTIN: Oh, yeah. 
JACK: Like the maps are so unintuitive and like...
AUSTIN (overlapping): Yes.
JANINE (overlapping): Mhm...
JACK: ...bizarre if you know those zones where you’re like—
AUSTIN (overlapping): They’re huge, right? Like, they’re like—
JACK (overlapping): —why?
AUSTIN (overlapping): —they’re like um...
JACK: And also they’re like weirdly linear, like—
AUSTIN: Yes.
JACK: —like you can do that thing where you, like, need to get to point, like, C but weirdly you have to go via point Y to get there or something. 
AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah. They feel like very—
JANINE (overlapping): That’s all I remember about 1.0, right? Was like I was in that beta. I thought it was the most beautiful game I’d ever seen. My computer could barely run it. 
AUSTIN: (Wistfully) Uh-huh. 
JANINE: I made a—I made a pugilist cat girl or something. Um...
AUSTIN: Love that for you. 
[JACK laughs]
JANINE: ...and...[laugh] and then I remember, like—this was also the period of my life where I played MMOs and also paid attention to the writing in MMOs. So I was like, this—if I was ever gonna get 1.0, it would have been at this stage. 
AUSTIN: Yeah...
JANINE: And I just remember—I don’t remember anything about the story. I just remember, like, I got out of whatever starter town I had, and I got to one of the big uh...aetherytes just like, the first one you’re supposed to link up out of town or whatever. You had to like—I think you still have to, like, actually manually connect to it or whatever. But I got to that—
JACK (overlapping): Yeah, you um...attune. 
JANINE (overlapping) —and then I was like—yeah, yeah. Um, I got to that, and then I was like, “I don’t know where I am, or what I’m doing, or where I’m supposed to go, or what I’m supposed to do.” I just had no idea. I just, like, fought stuff in the forest for a bit, and there were just people going everywhere. The map made no sense to me. I had no sense of, like, [JACK chuckles] what the fuck I was doing, and then I was like “I think I’m done, actually.” [ALI laughs] And that was like the last I did of that. Also, my headphones just turned off. 
AUSTIN: I heard that happen.
JANINE (overlapping): Why do they keep doing this? 
JACK: It was really weird. 
JANINE: One second. 
AUSTIN: That was really weird. 
[Pause]
JACK: (Yawning) You know what I’m doing while we record? I’m—I’m downloading world of warcraft. [Laugh]
AUSTIN: No, Jack...
ALI: Oh...
JACK: I’ve never played it, and I think that once I finish this Final Fantasy arc, I’m gonna like, sit out until...
AUSTIN: The next...
JACK: ...whatever—“Forspoken” or whatever comes out. Of like...
AUSTIN (overlapping): Is that what the next one’s called? What?
JACK: Square Enix filed a copyright for something called “Forspoken,” which I think is the worst name, but—
[ALI chuckles]
AUSTIN: That’s so fucking funny.
JACK: It is—it is in character, right, with their—
AUSTIN (overlapping): It’s so—yeah, with “Heavensward”...
JACK (overlapping): —they didn’t even file it in association with Final Fantasy.
AUSTIN (overlapping): ...”HeavensWARD.” Uh-huh.
JACK: I think someone just saw a list of their—
JANINE (overlapping): “Forspoken” sounds very credible.
AUSTIN: It does. 
JACK: Yeah, someone saw their copyright and went “Ah, Forspoken, that sounds like a (laughing) Final Fantasy expansion. 
JANINE: They did one—
AUSTIN (overlapping): I’m shocked it’s not. 
JANINE (overlapping): —called “Stormblood”. Like, come on!
JACK: Uh-huh. Uh-huh!
JANINE: They did one called “Stormblood.” 
AUSTIN: Did—was it called “Stormblood”?
ALI: Yeah.
JACK: “Stormblood,” yup. 
AUSTIN (overlapping): What’s the other one? “Shadowbringers” is the other one. I was like what’s the other one? 
JACK (overlapping): “Shadowbringers”...
JANINE (overlapping): I can’t remember...I can never...
AUSTIN: Yeah...
JACK: “Heavensward”—
JANINE (overlapping): “Storm”—
JACK (overlapping): —is terrible. 
JANINE: —it has to be...it—sorry, I was just gonna say really quickly. It has to be “Stormblood” because “Shadowblood” is worse. 
AUSTIN: [Laughs] “Shadowblood” is worse. 
JACK: [Laughs]: Uh-huh. 
JANINE: “Stormbringer” is better, but “Shadowblood” is worse. 
JACK: Yeah, uh-huh.
AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah, you can make that trade. 
AUSTIN (overlapping): “Heavensblood”? 
JACK: Shadow—
AUSTIN: He—Heavens—
JACK (overlapping): “Heavensblood.”
AUSTIN (overlapping): “Heavensblood”? 
JANINE: Ew. 
AUSTIN: Shocked that that’s a—”Heavensblood” is like an indie roguelike that’s miserable—
JACK: Uh-huh.
AUSTIN: —that has terrible art direction. 
JACK: Yeah. 
AUSTIN: “Heavenbringer”? “Heavensbringer”? “Heavensbringer” could be one. 
JACK (overlapping): That’s fine...
AUSTIN: It’s not good. 
JACK: Look, I’m just—
AUSTIN (overlapping): “Heavenspoke.” “Stormspoke.” [JACK laughs] Spoken? Spoken? Spake?
JACK (overlapping): “Forspoken!”
JANINE (overlapping): “Stormspoken” is good. 
JACK (overlapping): What does “Forspoken” mean?  
AUSTIN (overlapping): “Stormspoken” is alright. 
JACK (overlapping): Oh, “Stormspoken” is good. That’s a Guild Wars 2 expansion.
AUSTIN (overlapping): Write that down in season 7—yeah, that is a Guild Wars 2—that is—
JANINE (overlapping): Yeah, use that one. Something—something, something “Stormspoken”. That’s a good character. 
AUSTIN: Mhm. Yeah
JANINE: Or like, something—single—one or two syllable name. 
AUSTIN: Mhm. What was the—what’s the Ordennan dude—Stornglass—Storm—mm. 
JACK: Stornras Glasseye.
JANINE (overlapping): Stornras Glasseye? 
ALI: Yeah...
AUSTIN: Stornras Glasseye. He could be—he could’ve been a “Storm”—he couldn’t because he has “Storn” already. 
[ALI laughs]  
JACK: I love how they were called the Impetus. That was a great name for a—
AUSTIN: That was fun, yeah. 
JACK: —for a, like, exped—like, a controlling force. 
AUSTIN (overlapping): Shoutouts to Ordenna. [Pause] Time.is?
JACK: Six AND seven!
ALI: Mmh.

AUSTIN (overlapping): They shouldn’t put those together. 
JANINE: No. Mhm. 
AUSTIN: Twenty...
JANINE: Twenty-three?
AUSTIN: Yeah. Synced up. [Several discordant claps] Almost forgot to clap. 
[ALI laughs]
JANINE: Was that a good one? [Laugh] Sounded...
AUSTIN: It was not a good one.

ALI (overlapping): I feel like I was so loud and so early. 
AUSTIN (overlapping): Let’s do one more.  Let’s do one more. Uh...
JANINE: Thirty-seven? 
AUSTIN (overlapping): Thirty-eight. 
JANINE: Okay, thirty-eight. 
AUSTIN: Okay. 
[Discordant claps]
AUSTIN: Oh, I was early. [Laughs] 
ALI (overlapping): [Laughs] It’s okay. It’s fine. 
AUSTIN (overlapping): It said fifty when it hit. It’s fine. 
JANINE: I’m, like, clapping weird today. Like I was holding—
AUSTIN: (Sympathetic) Mmh...
JANINE: —my hands in a position I don’t usually hold them when I clap.

JANINE: Um...Okay!
