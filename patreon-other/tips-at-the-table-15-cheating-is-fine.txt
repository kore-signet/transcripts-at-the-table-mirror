Tips at the Table: Cheating Is Fine
transcribed by thedreadbiter


KEITH: All right, everybody, welcome to Tips at the Table, an RPG podcast focused on critical questions, hopefully-smart answers, and fun interaction between good friends. I am your host, Keith J Carberry. You can find me on Twitter at KeithJCarberry or the Let’s Plays that I do at youtube.com/RunButton. With me today is Alisha Acampora!


ALI: Um, hi! You can find me at ali_west on Twitter or you can find us over at Friends_Table.


KEITH: Sylvia[1] Clare!


SYLVIA: Hi, I’m Sylvia. You can find me on Twitter at captaintrash and you can find my other show Emojidrome on iTunes or Google Play.


KEITH: Uh, Andrew Lee Swan.


DRE: Hey, you can find me on Twitter at swandre3000.


KEITH: All right, so it’s September and everyone knows it!


ALI: [amused] Mm-hm!


DRE: Mm-hm!


KEITH: And so we’re doing the Tips for September!


ALI: [wheezy laugh] How was everyone’s summer?


[quiet laugh from SYLVIA]


DRE: [cross] I love fall.


KEITH: [cross] Oh, I think it was good. [amused] I’m having a hard time remembering.


ALI: [laughs] How are you liking the leaves changing?


[SYLVIA laughs quietly]


KEITH: Honestly, the colder weather gets me a little bit down. I would much [ALI: Mm.] prefer it to stay where it’s at now, in mid to — mid-70s to mid-80s.


[ALI laughs]


DRE: I’m really worried bout the time change and it becoming darker [ALI: Oh, yeah…] in two months.


SYLVIA: I’m scared of Halloween, ‘cause that’s when the ghosts show up, [cross] and that’s next month.


KEITH: [cross] Oh, it’s the scariest day of the year.


ALI: [cross] Yeah.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


ALI: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.


SYLVIA: That’s a month from now, we gotta get ready.


ALI: [amused] Uh-huh!


KEITH: All right, do you wanna start with the questions?


SYLVIA: Yeah, we should — 


ALI: Sure!


SYLVIA: — [cross] probably…


KEITH: [cross] Okay! Because of the way that I had to do this, uh, I don’t have… the titles. But I’m sure that we can get the gist from the actual questions. This is from Bee Old. 


“Hi Table Friends, 


“I’m starting to get really bummed out because it seems that every campaign I start fizzles out after one or two sessions, no matter how excited my players are. This might have to do with how all of my games so far have been online, over Discord and Roll20, but even when I specifically play with close friends whose schedules line up with mine, no one seems excited to play anymore. I GM whenever I offer to start a new game, because I know I’m not that good at it and I don’t wanna be like “play a game with me!” and then turn around and go, “but you have to do all of the work!” and the only way to get better is to do it a bunch, but when my group disperses before we ever find our footing in a situ — in a world or situation, I feel like I haven’t learned anything new, and I just wasted a bunch of my friends’ time. Basically, I’m new-ish at GMing, and I’m having trouble keeping my players interested long enough to keep a game going for more than a few sessions. What should I do? Should I just try to be a player for a little longer to figure out what I would want out of a session — what I would want out of a session?” 


Anybody have any opening thoughts?


DRE: Hm.


SYLVIA: Well — eh…


DRE: I mean, [cross] it’s a bummer.


SYLVIA: [cross] It’s hard! Like, I’ve been in this situation a few times as well — 


KEITH: As a player?


SYLVIA: — as some — as both — no, as like a GM, a new GM trying to like get a session going and having it fizzle out. Um. And it’s tough, and what I kinda figured out was… One! Sometimes it’s just the group doesn’t work out, because scheduling a [KEITH: Mm-hm.] tabletop game is a nightmare, that [DRE: Mm-hm.] no one should ever have to do. Um.


KEITH: What about when you specifically play with close friends whose schedules line up?


SYLVIA: Uh, well! [ALI laughs slightly] I missed that specific part, I — it’s a long question, and it’s [KEITH: Yeah!] 9 pm on a September evening. [ALI wheeze-laughs]


KEITH: A beautiful September evening, by the way, [SYLVIA: Yeah.] it’s like 72, a nice breeze…


ALI: [amused] It’s gorgeous.


SYLVIA: I think the thing is you gotta talk to your players to figure out what their goals are for the campaign and figure out the tone you want, too, ‘cause that’s another problem that I’ve run into, is um I have one tone in mind, and then… For example, a friend of mine comes back to me and says, “Hey, my character’s rival in our cyberpunnk game is what if the cyborg ninja from Metal Gear was also a clown?” and I’m like. Well, I’ve constructed an entire conspiracy here, but I’ll try and fit him in! Um. Which obviously is not the same, but it is definitely good to get on that same page, and that will typically help with keeping the flow going, and it’ll help with having communication being open as well.


KEITH: Yeah, I also think like— so it does say… so it seems like Bee Old has tried a few different times, and a few different times it’s always lasted at least a few sessions, and so like I think maybe write a short campaign that’s only a few sessions, and that way you get…to the end of it, and, like, whether or not you end up being happy with how it went, at least, like, getting to the end, you get to be like, oh, I now have the experience of starting and finishing a campaign. Like, I think there’s an idea of tabletop games — and like Friends at the Table I think doesn’t do an — doesn’t do a ton to dispel this, like, impression — but there’s like this like, when I grew up I always heard of people that had like ten-year long campaigns, you know, [ALI laughs quietly] and like campaigns would just would go on [DRE laughs quietly] for months and months and months, and it’s like, oh, we started as — you know, we started as worms and, you know, ten years later we’re — we have nothing left to do but kill all the gods and it’s like, okay, this is crazy. You can just have a session that lasts one or two g… like, a game that lasts one or two sessions. Like there’s nothing wrong with that, either.


ALI: Yeah, totally.


DRE: Mm-hm!


ALI: Um. I think part— my thing for this with this question is like there’s a lot of like, I don’t know if it’s like a scheduling issue or if it’s a problem with me being a GM, and like, I think in that case like taking some of these systems that you really wanna play with your friends and like putting them on the back burner and like trying to play more like GMless stuff might be better?


KEITH: Yeah, Ali, you have experience playing an RP — doing like roleplaying that now has lasted like [ALI laughs] years and years and years and years, like do you have any — like, do you ever go through a period of where it feels like it might  fizzle out and like what gets — what gets you out of that sort of feeling, if you have?


ALI: Um, typically it’s just — it’s always just a scheduling thing, or like we’re busy, or like the like [laughs] to get to like a different part of the story, we have to like go through this thing and we’d rather just be at Point B instead of having to deal with Point A. It’s tough ‘cause a lot of the suggestions I have are like, if you’ve been playing for a long time, and like, you’re losing the magic or whatever, here’s some things that you can change, but like in terms of like not being able to get anything off of like the ground floor? Um. That’s a bummer. I think that like… [sighs] planning things that will be like only two or three or four sessions or whatever just [laughs] I immediately went to four, but like two or three is also fine. Something like —


KEITH: Sorry, two or three what?


ALI: Just two or three sessions, like [KEITH: Oh, okay. Yeah yeah yeah.] [DRE: Mm-hm.] this is — we’re gonna play this game and you know we’re going to make these characters but we know that it’s gonna be kind of finite in this way, might be like a good way to kind of get your confidence? [KEITH: Mm-hm.] Before you’re like, planning these big things that are gonna last a really long time. 


KEITH: Yeah.


ALI: That t — 


DRE: Does D&D still make those like— the prepackaged [cross] like one-shots?


KEITH: [cross] Oh, they would never stop selling those, yeah.


[Laughter]


DRE: Yeah. I mean…. yeah. But I mean, that might be like — like, yeah. I think that might be a good like — both like Ali was saying, I think having something that’s like, contained and short, and then if you are kind of, you know, nervous as a newer GM, like just having like, you know, stuff there. [KEITH: Yeah.] So you don’t always have to make everything up — it’s not all on you.


KEITH: Another thing about those one-shots that I do… appreciate is like… Like, the one-short is there for you to like play through it. Like they give you the whole thing, and they’re like okay, now go do it. But the — I think the strongest thing about those one-shots is that, like, they’re not watching you? So you can actually just do whatever you want with them. [ALI laughs]


DRE: Yeah, true.


KEITH: Like nobody [slight laugh] — like you’re not gonna get someone from Wizards of the Coast being like, [menacing] “You changed our one-shot!” like. [SYLVIA laughs quietly] And I bet even a lot of the people that write those are looking for people to mess with them. So like you could always — something that I did when I first started GMing was, I would take a one-shot andi would like keep the combat encounters? And I would change like pretty much everything else about them, becuse the combat encounters were my least favorite thing to do? [ALI laughs] As a GM. I didn’t mind — it’s not that I — I didn’t mind playing through them, I just didn’t want to come up with them. So you could always take a one-shot and change it, or take a short campaign and like — a pre-written short campaign and change it. And I wanna go back to Sylvia’s point and like double highlight it. You could also, like, you know — it sounds like you have a lot of friends that are willing to play tabletop games with you, which is nuts, to me. [quiet laughs from ALI] And it sounds like you’re in a really good position, and they keep wanting to come back, so they’re at least having fun and are excited about the idea. But it could just be that like… you all different ideas about what you want to be doing in the minute, and maybe just like double checking that you’re all on the same page on like the types of game that you wanna be playing. Any last thoughts on this one?


SYLVIA: No!


KEITH: No? All right, let’s move on.


DRE: [singing] Bom-bom-bom bom-bom bwomp, weeohh!


KEITH: All right, from Skyler… [like watch-all] Wachtel… [laughs]


[SYLVIA snorts]


ALI: …Uh-huh?


KEITH: [laughs] I’m just waiting for someone to know how to say that better than me.


DRE: [like whack-tell] Wach — Wachtel.


KEITH: [whack-tell] Wachtel.


SYLVIA: [like wok-tull] Wachtel?


KEITH: From Skylar.


DRE: [wok-tull] Wachtel’s [laughing] probably the actual answer…


KEITH: Um. “I started GMing at my local game store for some great new friends. One of them has been rolling…” oh! “One of them has been rolling, quickly putting his hand down, and changing it to a 17 to 20. I’ve watched him do it, but I haven’t said anything because I remember you saying that players need authorship of the story too, so I’ve been trying to think about this positively. But now some of the other players are getting suspicious and making comments. I would hate to call him out and make him feel excluded, but I don’t want my other players to feel like they’re getting the short end of the stick! What’s your opinion on fudging dice rolls, Austin and friends?” Austin’s not here, that’s fine. [laughing] “Thanks for so much of the great content.” Um. First impressions, I had an immediate first impression to this, and then kind of reconsidered, so. I want [ALI: Oh, Okay.] to hear what other people’s immediate thoughts were.


DRE: Send them to dice jail!


ALI: [laughs] My like, my immediate first thought to this is like, players definitely need authorship in the story, like. Changing dice rolls is not the way to that.


KEITH: Yeah, that’s not what authorship [DRE: Yeah.] is. [ALI: Yeah.] I think that you’re — that was my first impression, and I think we can — I think that we should talk about like, this part of it before I say anything — any of the other weirdo thoughts that I had?


[DRE laughs]


ALI: [laughing] Okay!


KEITH: But it is like… like, authorship, like… that’s the thing about playing a roleplaying game is you’ve got the GM and you’ve got the players and they all should have authorship, but they also should all be making decisions based on the dice that they roll. And like the GM is rolling dice, and all the players are rolling dice, and so not — so like changing your dice rolls is not… authorship, but it’s like denying authorship. You know what I mean? Does that make sense?


ALI: Yeah.


DRE: Mm.


ALI: Yeah. Yeah. ‘Cause it’s like, I mean, I’ve definitely gotten into situations, and that’s probably on recording somewhere where I’ve been like, okay, but can’t we just do house rules, or like, [KEITH laughs] can’t we like —[DRE laughs] is a rule really that important? And Austin’s answer is always yes, and I’m always really frustrated by that, but I get it, ‘cause like, you’re there to play a game at the end of the day, and like, the structure around those things is what’s gonna keep making it interesting and [KEITH: Mm-hm.] like equal playing field for everybody?


KEITH: Yeah.


ALI: The flip side of this is like… like [laughs]. And I don’t want it to — I — mm.  I don’t want to say this in a way that sounds like mean, but like, the — mm. [cross] There should be something with the — 


KEITH: [cross] No, do it in a mean way. That’s fine.


[ALI laughs]


DRE: Yeah.


ALI: There should be something with the GMing where it fels like, where like — that person should be just as interested in their character’s failures as they should be in their successes.


KEITH: Yeah! Sure.


ALI: And like, that’s not all on the GM, like y’all should defintiely have like a pull-aside, a conversation about this where it’s like…


DRE: Yeah.


ALI: You know, I know you’re nervous about failing or whatever, maybe you really wanted to do this thing, but like, if you had failed, something else cool could have happened, and we could have found a way to like, you know, make sure that you did that cool fire spell or like— were triumphant in some other way. Bu tlike, [amused] you can’t… [laughs] You can’t just put your hand down!


KEITH: [over ALI laughing] Yeah, right? And just like roll, like, “nah, it’s a sa — it’s 18!” “We all saw it say —” “No, it’s an 18!”


[ALI and DRe laugh]


ART: You pulled out a marker and wrote an 8 next to the 1 you rolled! 


KEITH: Yeah, you wrote a 1 next to every number on this d20, so like your 1 became an 11, but your 18 became a 118! That’s not even real!


[ALI trails off laughing]


C’mon, Derrick! Jesus christ! 


DRE: Derrick!


KEITH: Derrick, what are you doing?!


DRE: I’m gonna amend my first answer of send them to dice jail, and say basically what Ali said. Like, talk to them individually. I would like to believe this person’s doing this ‘cause they don’t wanna fail. ‘Cause like, failing a dice roll feels bad, and, like, especially if you’re in a group, and it’s like, aw, but it I fail this roll I’m gonna fuck over the whole group and I’m gonna be the person that lets the whole team down! Like.


KEITH: Mm-hm.


DRE: So. Yeah. Don’t actually send them to dice jail.


KEITH: So here’s my weirdo second — here’s my second — here’s my devil’s advocate hot take right?


ALI: Okay. [laughs] Okay!


DRE: Woo.


KEITH: So, you’re cheating in a game. [ALI: Mm-hm.] And technically, let’s like for — obviously everybody’s investing their time in the game, and it’s important because everybody at the table is making it important, but. This person decides that they wanna cheat, and I think that it’s only as wrong as the people that want to call him out on it make it. And so it sounds likepeople are getting suspicious, and do not like it, but it’s like, if  you wanna run a game where someone’s cheating and everyone kind of knows it, and everyone kind of plays along, I don’t know! That’s fine by me. Right? Like that’s not [ALI laughs] like, you decided on your own that you didn’t think it was that big a deal that this player was changing. And if no one else ever noticed, and it didn’t bother you, then, I don’t know! Whatever, right?


ALI: [snorts and laughs] Um. Attached to this devil’s advocate thing, Dan Brockman


[15:00]


makes a comment in the chat that like the one frustrating thing with D&D is that sometimes a failure just means that like, it’s gonna take so much longer, [KEITH: Yeah. Yeah.] [SYLVIA: Mm-hm, yeah.] ‘cause it’s just like a fight or whatever? And if it’s like that, then it’s fine, [cross] but like with other people…


KEITH: [cross] We technically don’t know that this is D&D? [ALI: Yeah.] So it could be like [DRE: True.] a game that has like more nuanced rules than D&D does, [ALI: Yeah.] but it’s also GMing a game at a local store, so it probably [SYLVIA: Yeah.] is D&D.


SYLVIA: Also [DRE laughs] most D20 stuff runs similar — at least, like, in my limited experience when I played D20 stuff, it’s similar enough to D&D… [cross] in some cases, that we can at least talk about it like that.


KEITH: [cross] Yeah, it’s definitely like an older school style that D&D draws from to be like a D20 game.


SYLVIA: Yeah. Uh. Man, I don’t know how to — like, the thing is, I think what’s goin on, like we kinda touched on, is that the person doing this is probably just really scared to mess up. Like I’ve been there. I’ve — also, I haven’t done this on the show, this was when I was ten years old! [cross] I used to do this. So I understand.


KEITH: [cross] Yeah. It’s impossible for us to cheat, ‘cause we use Roll20.


SYLVIA: Yeah, we can’t do it. We use Roll20. [cross] It’s impossible for me to lie.


KEITH: [cross] A machine does all our dice rolling.


SYLVIA: Um. But like, I get the nervousness there, because you’ve like, depending on the group, like three or four other people who are like hoping you don’t do that. So like, talk to them and be like, don’t worry. Like, ‘cause [stammers] the thing that I find like — that I really like with Friends at the Table is that I’ve never felt worried about like — I’ve always felt like the GM — and the other players as well — are like safety nets for me, so if I fuck up, something’ll happen in the campaign, but I trust them that it’s not going to be a thing that just makes me feel bad. You know?


KEITH: Mm-hm. Yeah.


ALI: Yeah.


SYLVIA: And I guess it’s more just like assuring this person that like [KEITH: Yeah.] rolling under a 10 isn’t the end of the world, and it could honestly lead to some cool stuff happening for your character.


KEITH: And this is — but that’s a good point, like that’s another reason cheating in tabletop games does happen, because like, there are a lot of bad GMs out there, and this is part of what Dan was saying in the chat, there are a lot of bad GMs out there that like make rolling bad? The consequences, like — rolling well means having fun, and rolling bad means not having fun. [SYLVIA: Yeah, it’s the — ] Like the conse — like there’s ne — a lot of GMs — and it’s not, y’know, individual GMs’ fault, a lot of it has to do with like the evolution of these games, and where the most popular games are at in terms of like, how they deal with failure, and then jsut like the culture surrounding those games, but like a lot of times, when you mess up, like it’s — it literally is just not fun. Whether it’s things take longer, or it’s just like, oh, this consequence means that we’ve gotta, like, just like everything sucks and we’re not having fun anymore, and like we’ve got a GM that is looking to kill [laughs] their players. [ALI laughs] [DRE laughs]


Like, there is a lot of tabletop roleplaying games where failure does suck, and I think that [DRE: Yeah.] that is like… I don’t know, like maybe, either directly or indirectly communicating to this person that like that’s not what this table is about and failure isn’t a problem and it can be fun and interesting, and it doesn’t just mean okay now we have… less fun for the next half — or oh, you know. Someone heard us open this door, so now we have to do 45 minutes of combat that none of us wanted to do. [ALI laughs]


SYLVIA: [laughing] That’s literally happened to me!


KEITH: Yeah, I know, it sucks, right? [SYLVIA: It’s the worst!] And then it’s always like 45 minutes of combat that goes — that’s like right before the 45 minutes of scheduled combat, and so now you’re doing an hour and a half of combat, and it’s like, we’ve been here for four hours and three hours of it was fighting guards. [ALI laughs] Like, guards for what? It’s like I don’t know, guards! So it, y’know [laughs], like. Take it easy on cheaters. There’s a reason that people are cheating. ‘Cause, I don’t know, sometimes people are just cheaters. But, like, y’know. Do whatever you feel is the right thing to do. If other people at your table seem like they’re not comfortable with it, then definitely bring it up.


ALI: Yeah. This definitely deserves a pull-aside, at least. ‘Cause like we’ve like guessed at what some motivations here could be, but like, talking to the person and being like why are you doing this, you should probably [KEITH: Mm-hm. Yeah.] stop, and fiding out is like an issue of like dynamics with the other players, or like, character stuff, is gonna be important [KEITH: Yeah!] and will make the game better and, you know. [sighing] So on… 


KEITH: Yeah. And! Maybe he’s not cheating, maybe he just likes tapping the table [starts laughing]


[everyone laughs]


Okay, moving on! 


SYLVIA: It’s a good luck thing, that’s why the rolls are so good!


DRE: Yeah!


[laughter]


KEITH: This is from Shaun. “Dear Tips at the Table,


“Long-time listener —” this is actually I think a similar question in a couple ways. “Dear Tips at the Table, 


“Long-time listener, first-time Tips questioner. My gaming group is extremely reluctant to incorporate mechs into our fairly stock D&D 5e campaign. How do I convince them that it’s a perfectly viable application of a gnome’s Tinker ability? Follow-up question to my real question, any advice on how to deal with rules lawyers / buzzkills? 


“Sincerely, Mechless in Miami, I’m not really from Miami, Shaun.”


DRE: Where you from, Shaun? [cross] What are you hiding?


KEITH: [cross] Yeah, where are you — what are you hiding?! [ALI laughs]


SYLVIA: Could be [cross] Mechless in Minneapolis. 


DRE: [cross] Where are you hiding?


SYLVIA: You could [cross] have picked any M.


KEITH: [cross] Yeah, that would be funny if it was a different M place.


SYLVIA: Yeah! [ALI laughs]


DRE: Or Minnehaha? [cross] I can’t think of…


SYLVIA: [cross] Mechless in Manchester.


DRE: Yeah, ooh.


ALI: Mm-hm.


SYLVIA: Yeah. 


DRE: By the sea.


SYLVIA: Ooh.


KEITH: Mechless in Man — [laughs] Mechless by the sea, and Manchester by the sea. [ALi laughs] In September. [weak laugh] 


[everyone else laughs loudly]


All right, all right. Anybody have something for this?


[various sighs]


SYLVIA: Uh?


KEITH: I can share my immediate first impression.


SYLVIA: Please, ‘cause I have a feeling it’s kinda similar to mine.


KEITH: Um [ALI: Yeah.] I don’t — listen to your table, man! There’s no [DRE: Yeah.] — like… I think that you have a legitimate argument that is “I want mechs in my fantasy campaign, gnomes have a Tinker thing and they do weird machine stuff, and they should be able to have mechs if I want them to have mechs.” But it sounds like if everybody at your table’s like no, that’s not the kind of world that we wanna make, um. Like maybe that — maybe they’re wrong. Maybe you’re wrong. It doesn’t matter, but it’s like, it just sounds like you should be making the — you should be trying to make the game that the people in your party wanna do? And it sounds like that’s where you started. You started being like, should we have gnomes with mechs? And everybody said no. But that — I think that that just means that like you gotta go with what everybody else wants.


SYLVIA: Yeah.

DRE: Mm-hm.


SYLVIA: Uhh…


ALI: Yeah.


SYLVIA: That being said, like, if you are a person who like likes to be more flexible with the rules, that’s a — I feel like everything I say on this is “talk to your GM!” but, hey, guys, communication between friends is really important! [ALI laughs] [KEITH: Yeah.] That’s somethin I’ve learned this year. Y’know. Just throwin that out there. You didn’t come here for that tip, but there it is. But like talk to them and the group as a whole, and be like, what stuff are we willing to bend on and what stuff are we not? Because like, there’s probbaly other things that… like… [stammers] there’s other rules… I was gonna say rule laws, but that’s the same word twice. [KEITH: You know I—] There’s other, like — I’m sure there’s other like elements that people are willing to like bring in stuff that you find interesting. Like, maybe not mechs, but, maybe you can get, like, a cool… like, Doctor Octopus backpack. [ALI laughs] You know?


KEITH: Sorry, I just had a thought, and like I — for like literally no reason, I assumed that Shaun was the GM. But there’s nothing here that says that, and it even kind of sounds like they’re playing a gnome, [SYLVIA: Yeah!] and their GM is who’s saying, no, you can’t use the Tinker abiility to have a mech.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


KEITH: So maybe [stammers] have to amend my statement, which is, like… I feel like if you’re not the GM, then like, the GM saying no is less of a reason to get shut down than if you’re the GM and the rest of the table is saying no? So, I don’t know if that changes it for anybody — I don’t know why I assumed that Shaun was the GM. [ALI laughs] If Shaun is in there, let me know if you’re the GM or not.


DRE: All right, let me do some rules lawyering here, ‘cause I just looked up the Tinker move.


ALI: [intrigued] Okay!


[SYLVIA laughs]


KEITH: Oh, great.


DRE: Um, the Tinker move says you can use your tools to construct a tiny lockwork device, [ALI: Okay.] that only functions for 24 hours.


ALI: Okay.


KEITH: Okay.


ALI: So yeah, I — 


DRE: That’s not a mech.


ALI: [laughs] My — yeah, my initial response to this is like, I like — I like to be a rulebreaker [laughs] I like to have house rules, so I’m immediatley like [SYLVIA: Yeah.] you know, you should just do it, like, whatever. Like, when I look at D&D rules or if I hear people playing D&D, I think — sometimes I think of like how kind of setting-agnostic some of that stuff can be, and it’s like, if you have Tinker, it’s a machine, you could just do it, they should just let you do it. But like, I do also get that like if could be a tone thing. The players don’t really wanna go in that direction with the setting or whatever and that’s like also a completely legitimate feeling?


KEITH: Yeah. Gnomes are wicked setting-breaking in — like any time they show up, they’re always doing this.


ALI: [laughs] I feel — mm. No, sorry [laughs]. I just feel like if your desire to like have mechs in this game is like a solid block of ice, it might be worth kind of like chiseling down what you really kind of want out of that, [KEITH: Mm-hm.] and what it means for your character and what kind of thing that you want, or like what kind of ability, or like [KEITH: Yeah.] how you can imagine him kind of using it, and seeing if you can kind of scale it down?


KEITH: Well, I — and I do think Dre is right. I think that like… um. A mech does not sound like a viable application of the gnome’s Tinker ability. and so if you can’t… and I guess this is sort both what Dre said and what Ali said. If you, like… if you have to go with mechs, I think that you should like really reconsider the idea that the gnome’s Tinker ability is the way to get there? Because it sounds like it’s not. And if everybody agreed like, yeah, we can do gnome Tinker mech, then that’s fine, but it seems like that’s not what’s happening? And so, if there is another way to get like — figure out some way that actually does feel like it could through the rules, whether that’s like, I don’t know, you’re in command of a mech elemental or — like a rock elemental in the shape of a mech [DRE: Yeah.] like, [ALI Right.] or just some other thing — or like a big animal, like a familiar that you can ride, like.


[ALI laughs] There’s other ways to get to where you want, if the people that you’re playing with are… set on playing by the written rules, which is not a crazy way to play a game. [slight laugh] [ALI: [amused] It isn’t.] But like, try to find a different avenue, because gnome’s tinker ability says — it has two words in there. “Tiny” and “24 hours.”


ALI: Mm-hm.


KEITH: So. They’re not wrong.


ALI: Yeah. I do have a free suggestion, which is like maybe your character could like have this mech that isn’t active all the time, and they can like make a piece of it, and it can like power on for just the 24 hours. [amused] That’s like a whole character thing about how he has this mech that sometimes he like [sniffs] sets up. I don’t know. I don’t know your character, I don’t know the setting. [KEITH: Yeah.] But like you can like [DRE: Yeah!] scale it down and still be like oh I have this cool robot. Um. But yeah.


KEITH: Maybe just ask if we can — if you can do a different game, also. [slight laugh] Just like.


[ALI laughs]


SYLVIA: Yeah, there’s a lot of games with mechs out there. [cross] We’ve done a few.


DRE: [cross] That’s true.


KEITH: [cross] Yeah, there’s a ton of games that have mechs in them. Um. Or even just ask to do like a one-shot in a weird fantasty sci fi world where gnomes have mechs.


ALI: Yeah.


KEITH: And then you get to do — you get to have the mech stuff out of your system.


DRE: Play World of Warcraft!


KEITH: Don’t play World of Warcraft.


[ALI laughs]


DRE: But gnomes got mechs in that.


SYLVIA: Don’t play World of Warcraft.


KEITH: Don’t play World of Warcraft.


DRE: [dejected] Ah, yeah, okay, you’re right.


KEITH: Yeah. We’re right. From Casey: “Hi Friends! 


“You all mentioned previoulsy how you will make playlists or pregame routines or any number of things that help you get into the headspace of your characters before you play. I implemented some of these methods myself, but as the perception of my character changed, and as that character themself developed, I began to find these routines strange. I wasn’t sure I was getting it right. I felt like I was trying to get myself into the head of nmy original concept of the character, not who they had become over time. But maybe, for some characters at least, trying to cling to past versions of themselves feels appropriate?


“As you played through almost a year and a half of the same characters, and as you prepare to return to some characters some of you have been playing for several years now,” uh, yeah coming soon is, uh, Spring in Hieron, [ALI laughs] “how do you change your routine to get into character, if at all? How can you think, ‘this is them and directs me to feel how they’d feel’?


“Thank you, Casey.”


Um. Ali, I think that you probably make the most playlists, [ALI snorts] out of anyone here, is that — does anybody feel like they make more playlists than Ali?


SYLVIA: [amused] I don’t think I make more, but I do make a lot of playlists.


KEITH: [cross] Okay.


ALI: [cross] Okay, yeah, I think— 


DRE: [cross] Yeah, I think I might be like second or third.


KEITH: Okay.


ALI: I think we’re — we might all be on even, um. [cross] Playlist playing fields.


KEITH: [cross] [stammers] I bet that I make the least. I don’t…


ALI: Okay.


KEITH: I sometimes don’t even make one. For my cha — [ALI: Yeah.] but I have other things that I do, so. You should all start.


ALI: Well, my example is that I did make a new Hella playlist this year. My first Hella playlist I made after season one, and it was like kind of a reflection to season one, so I could still use it for season two, and then season two I was like oh, this is such a big change that I like need to just do a new thing. Which feels like it might be the point that you’re at, too, which is like, okay, where do I start from plan B, to like just a fresh page, who is this person now? And like you shouldn’t feel bad about doing that. It’s not like you’re like, letting go of this, or like you’re doing it the wrong way if you’ve been like playing this character for a really long time [amused] and now they’re a different person, like that’s kind of the point?


KEITH:  Yeah, yeah. It feels like you’re doing it right by having a character that has changed to feel disconnected from [DRE laughs] like the idea that you had before you even started playing the character.


ALI: Mm-hm.


KEITH: Um. So, yeah. I think that — Casey, it sounds like that you had that sort of like feeling, but haven’t pulled the trigger on whether or not you agree with yourself or not, but I think that that sounds true. I buy it. [ALI laughs] I’ve definitely like made a playlist and then later on felt like it was not exactly right. [DRE: Mm.] It happened with Gig. I made a playlist and then it turned out to not sort of fit with like — like halfway through, like post-Miracle.


ALI: Yeah, and that would be at the point that you would be like, oh, this character has changed significantly.


KEITH: Yeah.


[30:00]


And then instead of making a new Gig playlist I made a playlist for the Ark teens. Which is great and it is on my Youtube and you can listen to it.


[ALI laughs quietly] Um. [DRE laughs] Dre, Sylvia, anything?


SYLVIA: Uh! I think like...the important thing I wanna say is just like, make sure you’re not like deleting the old stuff, ‘cause one, that’s really nice to go back to, but two, I find it really helpful to revisit the old stuff that I don’t think like — there’s a lot of stuff I do not think applies to Ephrim anymore, especially with… I was gonna — I can’t figure out how to do the September bit and talk around stuff that we’ve put out, so I’m just gonna like break the fourth — ah — so, with like, after what’s gone on [cross] so far in Spring.


KEITH: [cross] [blowing air for static foley] Sorry, something’s happening. [blowing air]


[ALI and DRE laugh]


SYLVIA: [loudly] Yeah, I’m going through a time hole!


DRE: You just keep saying La Li Lu Le Lo, I don’t get it… [ALI laughs]


SYLVIA: Ah… but I still hold onto that, because I wanna make sure that I have that like root element of this character, because that was still your starting point, and you should try and at least have like a little bit of that in there?


KEITH: Instead of making a new playlist, have any of you added on to a playlist and so it has like [DRE: Oh, yeah.] [SYLVIA: Yep.] the entire playlist has like an arc to it? The same {DRE: Mm-hm!] arc as the character?


DRE: Yeah, that was my Throndir in Winter playlist, was that.


ALI: [intrigued] Mmm.


KEITH: What did it start with and what did you — when did you end up at?


DRE: Let me see. Um… let me go pull it up here. I mean, it’s a lot of like folk and like alt country, [ALI laughs] because that’s just Throndir. But like — I mean, the biggest thing was after — I mean, I guess, spoilers for Winter in Hieron. After Throndir got turned into a vampire, I put two songs about vampires on that playlist.


SYLVIA: Hell yeah.


KEITH: Nice.


ALI: [laughing] There you go!


KEITH: Does anyone — [cross] while Dre is finding —


DRE: [cross] Uh, no, I put three songs. First I put “Let’s Get Fucked Up and Die” by Motion City Soundtrack [SYLVIA: Oh my god.] [ALI: I…] because I got fucked up and died. And then [laughing] I did two songs about vampires.


KEITH: Um. Does anyone do anything that isn’t a playlist?


SYLVIA: Um, I know — I’ve only done it like once, and it was specifically because it was a thing where I was like I need a lot of visual reference for this, but Pinterest boards, I know a lot of people do, [DRE: Mm-hm] and can be [ALI: Mm.] really helpful for figuring out a character. [KEITH: Mm-hm.] That was what helped me sorta figure what i wanted to do with World Wide Wrestling RPG? For the Bluff City episode we did.


ALI: Ooh, yeah.


DRE: Yeah.


SYLVIA: Um. And like that is, honestly, really fun? And maybe, hey, Pinterest! You guy hear about this thing? [ALI laughs] Give that a shot! ‘Cause that’s also something that  you can just keep adding and adding to and it just like is named after your character. Like. [KEITH: I—] [ALI: Oh. Yeah.] At least that’s what I did. And I just kept throwing things at it. Yeah.


ALI: Right. And then just like a faucet you just scroll down and it’s like oh, this is who this person has been this whole time.


SYLVIA: Exactly! Yeah.


KEITH: My big thing — my big thing is always like — it doesn’t have to be like, sitting and thinking, like I don’t wanna give the impression that like before I record I just like sit in the dark and ponder, but a lot of what I end up doing that I find works really well is just like… feeling— like thinking on decisions that I’ve made in character, and depending on how the character feels about those decisions, either feeling right or wrong, like… I know that for the last couple episodes a lot of what I’ve done before we started is like think about the stuff that Fero has gone through, and like — and like where we’re at now, and been like, yeah, I fuckin — that’s totally the right thing that I did! [laughs quietly] And that helps get me in character. I don’t know — there’s — like there’s some level of… i don’t wanna say like method, but I pers— I try to like — the way that I get in character is always to just sound like a… like I do in my normal life talking? And I hope that comes through in the recordings, but like that’s a big part of that for me, is just like thinking about how I’ve acted and when Fero thinks it was the right thing to do, then feeling like I did a good thing, and when he feels like it was the wrong thing to do, feeling like I did the wrong thing. And just like trying to embody those feelings of feeling either right or wrong about stuff. Fero’s one of the characters that does not have a playlist, by the way, that’s…


ALI: [laughs] I — mm. I would love to hear a Fero playlist, but I could see why that might be… difficult.


KEITH: I just can’t think of any music that sounds the way that Fero’s music would sound. Like he’s just kind of —


ALI: Yeah.


KEITH: He just — I just kind — almost feel like he doesn’t have music for him. I don’t know, it’s a very s…


SYLVIA: Just bir— like finding birds singing on Spotify [cross] and making a playlist out of that.


KEITH: [cross] Yeah, just like ambient — [laughs] just like ambient noise? Yeah.


ALI: Yeah.


KEITH: All right, let’s see. I think we got more in here. All right, Ali, this one’s for you. This is from… [as in Anne] Andrea — or [as in awn] Andrea. I’m not positive. That could be both, right? That’s how… those are both spelled?


ALI: Uh-huh.


KEITH: “Hello, Friends! 


“I’m currently playing a character who has a fairly — who has fairly loose morals, ie, is kind of evil, but I always find it hard to actually play into that, because as a player, I get too towards the other characters that will be affected by my character’s bad choices. What are some ways of more into character when I’m playing a character who’s really different from yourself? Thanks!”


ALI: Okay. Um. [KEITH laughs] [laughs] It’s tough, because I — the way that I always play it, I always like… you know… I feel like it’s really kind of reactionary almost? And it’s like, okay, I’ve set up this character. Here’s how they feel about this thing — or this person, or this situation, whatever else — this is how they’re gonna act it out. And like — you know [laughs] sometimes that’s different from how a different character feels, and that’s the point of what we’re doing! [KEITH: Mm-hm.] Um. So like, it’s messy, sometimes you can feel bad about a thing, sometimes you can feel bad about characters, for sure, but like… [amused] that’s who the character is! Just… you know.


KEITH: Mm-hm.


ALI: Just — you just have to commit to it sometimes. [cross] I definitely like — 


KEITH: [cross] KEITH: Anybody else — oh, sorry.


ALI: [laughs] No, it’s fine. I’ve definitely like —  I mean, Keith knows, which… I think the day after we killed Adelaide, I was like [laughs] I specifically messaged you and I was like, I’ve been crying in my break room all day ‘cause I feel like people are like really upset about this, and you were like, why… would anyone be upset about that?! [laughs] [KEITH: Yeah.] And like… it’s like — you know.


KEITH: When you should have been upset about… Calhoun. [laughs loudly]


ALI: [laughs] I was — [DRE laughs] hey, I was also really upset about that! That’s… [KEITH sighs] another thing I was also really upset about. So yeah, I mean, like, it sucks, but it’s also like… you know, if that’s the way that you think about that character that’s, you know, the character that you’re playing then like, you’re gonna have a better time if you just commit to it?


KEITH: Yeah. And I think this might — this might — this… my advice from the end of the last question might go to this, like, maybe just spend so time convincing yourself that you are making the right choice. Like [ALI: Oh yeah.] ‘cause if you have a character that’s evil, but it making choices that you can’t rationalize to yourself, then that’s maybe where you should be focusing, because, like… I guess Fero’s another great example, like, there’s a lotta stuff that I’ve seen people be like, why is Fero doing this? And, to me, I like genuinely like, no, I totally understand why Fero is doing this. I think that he’s absolutely, like, justified in a lot of what he’s doing, and like — that’s probably mostly because I’m playing the character in a way that I believe… is… justified from the beginning, but it’s also probably because I sat with a lot of those choices, and like went like okay, so here’s all the stuff that Fero’s been going through. Here’s where he was a year ago, or like — not a year ago — here’s where he was last season, and here’s where he is now, and here’s like the different ideas that he’s had, and like this is why he’s doing this, and it makes sense. And so like Fero’s not evil… and I don’t really even think that he’s doing stuff that you would count as evil, but he definitely is doing stuff that other characters and people listening to the show can go like, what the fuck is this guy doing?!


[ALI laughs]


I don’t know, anybody else make any decisions that they had to like, con — -like, deal with as a player?


ALI: [amused] Yeah, Sylvia and Dre. [SYLVIA wheezes a laugh] Did you make any hard [cross] decisions in September?


DRE: [cross] I mean, yeah, fuckin… yeah. Hey.


SYLVIA: Uh! Y’know!


DRE: Quick shoutout to that session of Twilight Mirage where it was just my character fucking doing terrible things to Sylvia’s character.


[SYLVIA and ALI laugh]


SYLVIA: Yeah… Um. I don’t know — like, it’s — I don’t really have much to add other than to like echo your sentiments, Keith, of just trying to like… make sure that you feel like your cha — like you’re following what your char — like you internalizing your character’s beliefs, I guess is what I’m trying to say, [KEITH: Yeah.] where it’s like… Don’t be a method actor! I’m not saying that, but like, at least try and get yourself in the headspace where you’re just like, I’m pretending to be this person, [KEITH: Yeah.] what would this person do here?


KEITH: Well, yeah! [ALI: Yeah.] Try to be evil in a way where you — that you understand. There’s a lot of evil in the world that is really difficult to understand, but there’s a lot of evil where you can like, I see why this is happening. There’s like a direct line where it’s like okay, something happ — this person is making decisions based on who they are, and [ALI: Right.] that is evil, but, like, I can see it. I can see how it happened! I don’t know. That’s…


ALI: [cross] Yeah.


SYLVIA: [cross] I got — 


ALI: Oh, go —


SYLVIA: No, I was gonna say just to that, I guess, yeah, like… Be really petty. Like, that’s such a [ALI laughs] good in— that’s genuinely such a good emotion to get that like… like… I guess I’ll use the term sorta “loose morals” actions, like that’s how you can do that without feeling like weird about it, is convincing yourself like, well, this is just personal. This is just like — this person wronged me, so it’s fine that I’m doing this. [KEITH: Mm-hm.] And, I mean, I mean, I’ve personally obviously never done that on our show, [ALI wheezes and laughs] I’ve never done anything just because someone wronged me and decieved me for an entire season of our show. Uh. But y’know!


[quiet laughter]


DRE: Yeah, no, same. I’m with Sylvia. I’ve — yeah, never. Ever.


SYLVIA: Never.


DRE: Done that stuff.


KEITH: I haven’t. Literally haven’t.


DRE: No…


ALI: [laughing] Um.


KEITH: [self-satisfied] So.


DRE: I’ve never betrayed anyone.


ALI: [laughs] The thing about the motivations thing is like really important for me, because I feel like that was the big hurdle that… like needed to— I needed to get over to play Hella successfully. Like that first like big kind of like… argument or like clash or whatever that I had with Austin was like, I wasn’t able to communicate the way that Hella was evil? Um, so like with the first like, Calhoun, leaving him on the boat whatever, like, the way that my alignment was written and the way that I had like previously communicated it to Austin was like. He was like, well, if she’s evil she would definitely do this, and I was like, I don’t believe that. Like, she’s an evil person but is capable of caring about people in her life, so like being able to write like a very specific alignment there really helped me? [KEITH: Yeah.] And it also helped like having everybody at the table know like, okay, I’m gonna be getting up to some shit, but this is sort of the— you know. This is the way that it’s gonna go, so we can kind of all be on the same page there? And like, if the system that you’re using has like a bond system or an alignment, or like a way that you can like just clearly flag that for everybody else, just so like you can get rid of kind of the guilt of having to make those decisions, like, in-character.


SYLVIA: Actually, just the alignments thing. This — uh, you could be playing Dungeon World, so this might not apply, but if you’re playing a system that doesn’t have like a — like doesn’t have that sort of alignment descriptor, I find that it’s really helpful — like, it might be helpful to write down what your character’s like driving — like main drive is, right? Like it doesn’t have to encompass everything, but it can be a thing you look at, and also show you GM and be like, this is kinda like their core philosophy. [KEITH: Um.] And that can help [ALI: Yeah.] you guys figure that out.


KEITH: Just so that we cover all our bases, also, you could consider being Neutral or Chaotic, is another thing. Like. Chaotic is not necessarily… I consider Neutral to be more evil than Chaotic, but like there’s ways to be a character that has fairly loose morals without being evil.


ALI: Yeah.


KEITH: And so if you think that that’s a good choice for you, then you can pursue that. Um. Final thoughts on this before we move to the last question?


SYLVIA: Nope!


KEITH: All right. This is from GRick. “Hello Tips friends, 


“I have tendency to make pretty bad deci—” this is quotes. Quote-unquote ““bad” decisions in games. This isn’t on purpose. I’m not a jerk trying to ruin games by being intentionally disruptive and claiming [jerk voice] “it’s my alignment” or anything like that. [ALI snorts and laughs quietly] I’m just a real life odd person that doesn’t necessarily interact with people much anyway, so most of my social solutions are made up whole cloth, and I guess according to everyone — uh — end up being pretty off-the-wall. These fit in well with somewhat loose, casual games I typically play where fun can ensue due to elements of social chaos I unintentionally introduce; however, one of my groups, a group that was perhaps the most zany that I’ve ever played in, is trying to transition to a more serious story. I’m on board with this — I would love to tell a serious story and I trust this group of people, but my decisions: they’re still really bad. Innocent NPCs have died, the bad guys have gotten away, we’ve been jailed, and our reputation has been ruined in multiple communities. 


“This isn’t all my fault, but I’m playing the character who is supposed to be the voice of reason as the cleric, and too often I am enabling or outright supporting the bad decisions of party members when I’m not making them myself. And the thing is, I still feel really bad about those poor dwarves and all those other people we’ve hurt, even though they’re pretend. Should I just swear off serious games, or is there some way to check myself that I’m missing? I ask because some of you guys make [slight laugh] some pretty out-there decisions, but seem to know when to turn it off.”


ALI: Hmm…


KEITH: Just let everybody think on — chew on that for a second.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


ALI: [laughing] Yeah.


KEITH: I’ve seen all these, but I’m —  you know, ‘cause I put them in the thing, but. Just wanna —


ALI: Right, yeah, yeah.


KEITH: I want people to get their gut reactions in first.


SYLVIA: I mean, like, my first— I don’t think you should swear them off, I think you [KEITH: Yeah!]... might wanna figure out like… what you’re looking for from them and like how can… have the fun that you wanna have with your off-the-wall stuff 


[45:00]


while also making it fit the world that you and the people you’re playing with are in.


KEITH: Yeah, if GRick is here, by the way, I wish we got some examples of decisions?


DRE: Yeah…


KEITH: Because it’s also like— I don’t wanna say — I don’t wanna disagree with the premise here. I don’t wanna like —  yeah, I don’t wanna like just throw out the premise — is it possible that your decisions aren’t the bad ones? [ALI snorts]


DRE: [cross] Damn. Heavy.


KEITH: [cross] Like, it says right here, it says… “innocent NPCs have died, the bad guys have gotten away, we’ve been jailed, and our reputation has been ruined in multiple communities. This isn’t my fault, but I’m playing a character who is supposed to be ena — or who is enabling or supporting the bad decisions of other people.” So that doe— it sounds like, maybe just [SYLVIA snorts] start being the voice of reason. ‘Cause it sounds like other people are trying to kill people, and are getting you jailed, and are ruining your reputation. And you’re just not fulfilling the role of… voice of reason.


ALI: Yeah.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


KEITH: Or like maybe [stammers] if they’re all committed to playing a more serious game, the problem will fix itself. I don’t — ‘cause like… GRick, I’m sure that you’ve seen movies, and TV shows, or like, you listen to this show. [slight laugh] [ALI and DRE laugh] So you definitely have like experience like with stories. And so there’s just some things that happen in stories to make things —  like I’m sure that the situations that you’re in in these games are not like a hundred percent original… and require a hundred percent original solutions.


SYLVIA: Yeah. I guess… I think something that genuinely just might help you a little is… thinking a second before your character jumps in to just be like, yeah, do that! [ALI laughs] Not in terms of like, oh, don’t do — like not in terms of like, oh, I don’t want that to happen, but think of it in terms of, hm. Even though I wanna see this happen, maybe I shouldn’t say anything and just see. ‘Cause that’s — one, that’s really fun. But two, it helps you… it helps you learn to pick your spots with your outlandish stuff? And I think that’s a really important skill to have, because when you… you know, know when you wanna do something really off the wall, if you haven’t done like fifteen other things that are bouncing off that same wall, in the session, it makes it have more impact and it also like… you know, helps with pacing.


ALI: Yeah. I… there’s a lot I’m curious about in this situation, ‘cause like, a lot of this is like, the GM, obviously. A lot of this is the rest of the group. Like ‘cause it seems like you’re like doing these things, and then people react to them as if they’re like, you know, this big, horrible like thing that you’ve done, when like that isn’t your intention? [slight laugh] And like maybe — yeah.


KEITH: Yeah, that’s a good point, like what is your GM adding to the situation? Is it possible that there’s — that your GM is adding things to the situation that is not coming from the choices you’re making? ‘Cause it sounds [ALI: Right.] like they want—  it sounds like they’re trying to consider other people, and — I don’t — maybe you’re just considering them too late, maybe it’s [laughs] like you’ve already acted before you’ve tried to consider them, like Sylvia said? [ALI laughs] But yeah, like, is… I think that we’ve all… that’s not true. But I think that — I know that I have been in situations where like, a GM has totally distorted… somebody’s intentions to make something crazier than what should have happened.


DRE: Mm.


SYLVIA: Mm-hm.


ALI: Yeah. Um. Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day like the — you know. Playing a tabletop game is a group activity, so like, it wasn’t your fault that the NPCs died, or the bad guy’s gotten away, or that like you’ve been jailed. Like that is… [DRE: Yeah.] that is a group [slight laugh]... um, like, process, and that is everyone at the table. So like, you know, if it— if it’s something where you’re feeling sort of guilty about it, it can be a conversation where you’re having where like, you know, maybe I feel like I’m not communicating the right way because y’all are having reactions different to what I’m intending in these scenes or whatever else. Or it can be like, you know… [laughs] if your character has to be the voice of reason, like, put your foot down, like.


KEITH: Yeah.


ALI: Have fun doing that instead of being the guy who’s like oh, yeah, sure, you know, do what you want. And then also like feeling bad about the dwarves like at the end of the day, yeah, that sucked, but… you know, it was a group e— you know. You did it as a group, it wasn’t just you who did that. You shouldn’t swear off this.


KEITH: Well, I don’t — I think that you’re right that you shouldn’t just swear off everything that happens, but it also is like, there are definitely things that I can think of from Friends at the Table where I was like [ALI laughs slightly] I don’t like that this thing happened, and it wasn’t ‘cause of me. I was there, and I didn’t want it to happen, and it happened. [ALI: Mm-hm.] And so it is like — there is a thing— there is a part of playing tabletop games where sometimes… like, hopefully proportionate to how many people are playing, like, other people’s things happen even if you don’t want them to. 


ALI: Oh, yeah.


KEITH: But, so, i don’t know, what do you guys think about this as a tool? Like, if someone’s reacting in a way that you didn’t expect, stop the game and be like, oh, wait, hold on, sorry, why is this person reacting like this to — was it something that I said, or did you misunderstand me? Like, ‘cause here’s what I wanted to get from this.


ALI: Right, yeah. Yeah, I think like zooming on those moments a ittle bit more when you feel like that’s happening would be like important? But also, yeah, don’t feel guilt or like you shouldn’t [laughs] do this anymore, ‘cause it’s — yeah.


KEITH: Yeah. It’s not like chess, where like if you touch a piece you’ve gotta move it. Like it’s not —[ALI: Right. Yeah, yeah.] like if you say something and someone takes it wrong, or like you didn’t notice the implications of it and something weird happens, just trying stopping the game and be like, wait, hold on. Can you explain to me why this person is freaking out? All I asked was, you know, whatever. Um.


ALI: Yeah.


KEITH: Uh, anything else, anybody?


DRE: No, I like — what [SYLVIA: Yeah.] you’ve said just now is I think is a really good thing.


KEITH: All right, cool. So that is it. Remember that you can go to — or you can email Tipsatthetable@gmail.com to ask your own questions that we will get to. We do have some extra episodes coming out. I don’t know if you heard, but this is September, so [laughs] [ALI: Mm-hm.] we’ve got a little bit [DRE laughs] of extra work to do. You can also go to Friendsatthetable.cash; if you’re listening to this you already…are there, right? That’s true.


ALI: Uh-huh, yeah. You’re aware, you’re signed up. But you could tell other people about it.


KEITH: Yeah, tell other people about it. I don’t know, if you like it, maybe notch that thing up a little bit, uh. Anybody else [ALI snorts] have any last plugs that they wanna put in? Let’s go through one more time. Sylvia?


SYLVIA: What? Uh. Oh! We don’t usually do this at the end!


KEITH: [over ALI laughing] Hey, listen! I’m the host today, and I did a very professional job and so [SYLVIA: Yeah, no!] we get to do [ALI: Right, yeah!] what I wanna do.


DRE: Yeah.


SYLVIA: Um. I guess my Twitter is captaintrash and my other show Emojidrome is on iTunes and Google Play, and also thank you for supporting our Patreon, we did — I wanted to say thank you to them. That’s nice.


KEITH: Dre?


DRE: Uh, yeah! You follow me on Twitter at swandre3000 and I definitely echo what Sylvia said. Thanks, everyone who supports us on Patreon.


KEITH: Ali?


ALI: Uh, yeah! So… what did I want to say? okay, so tom— [laughs] tomorrow we’re probably doing a Live at the Table. I don’t know when yet, but we’re gonna be playing Fiasco, and that should be fun. As Keith said, we’re like behind on a bunch of stuff, and we are hoping to be completely caught up with Patreon stuff by the end of the year! So like.


KEITH: Yeah, yo, we’ve been recording so much stuff the last couple weeks, like [ALI: Yeah.] in a mad dash to get all caught up, and a lot of that stuff is really fun and good, so I’m excited for it to all finally come out.


ALI: Yeah. The end of a season and the start of a season is a lot of work, altogether. In both ways, it goes both ways. [KEITH: Mm-hm. yep.] [laughs] It takes a long time for there to be a little bit of relief. We’re kind of getting there, but it’s also December, and Austin also just had some dental surgery and is like doing some more, so. But despite that, we should caught up at the end of the year, that is our goal, and— 


KEITH: Yeah. And Dre and I both just moved.


ALI: Yeah!


DRE: Yeah.


ALI: It’s been… [KEITH: Yeah.] It’s been very good. Thank you for supporting us. [laughs]


KEITH: Yeah, of course.


ALI: But yeah, tomorrow tune in, and then, you know, there should be another Tips soon, another Live soon. We’re gonna try to be snappy with this — and then another Masks should come out this week as well!


KEITH: Another what?


DRE: Ooh!


ALI: Another Masks, [cross] another Bluff City?


KEITH: [cross] Oh, Masks. 


I thought you said another Mass, and I was like, what?!


ALI: [laughs] [cross] Yeah, you can join… 


KEITH: [cross] Um. You guys remember when I was like, what? That was what I was like.


[ALI and KEITH laugh]


All right, my name is Keith J Carberry. You can find me on Twitter at keithjcarberry. You can listen to — you can watch Run Button at youtube.com/RunButton. It’s got its own Patreon, contentburger.biz. Um, and that’s it! That’s all there is for this show! Goodbye and thanks for watching.


DRE: Bom bomp bomp!
