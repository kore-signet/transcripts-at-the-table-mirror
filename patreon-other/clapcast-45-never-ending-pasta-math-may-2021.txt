Clapcast 45: Never Ending Pasta Math (May 2021)
Transcriber: Jess (JortsMachoooo#6341)
Keith: Mmm, I think it’s still real.
Jack (overlapping): The never ending pasta pass—(changing vowel sound) pasta pass costs one hundred dollars plus tax, and also—
Keith: It’s funny, you have the reverse A’s on that.
Jack: I do! Pasta pass. Yeah.
Keith (overlapping): You have pasta pass (pronunciation guide: pæsta pɒss), and we have pasta pass (pronunciation guide: pɒsta pæss). [Laugh]
Jack: Yeah. Absolutely. That’s—[laugh]
Keith: We flipped them! [Continues laughing]
Jack: That’s called the international pasta switch.
Keith: Yeah.
Jack: They teach new linguistics students about it. Hi Austin!
Austin (overlapping): Hello.
Jack: Austin—
Keith: Part of what happens when you cross the pond is the A’s rotate.
Jack: Yeah, it’s—it’s bizarre! Um...how much—
Sylvi: That’s what “Turn A Gundam” is about. [Laugh] 
Austin (overlapping): Yes. 
Jack: [Laugh] Uh-huh.
[Keith laughs]
Sylvi: ‘Cause the A’s rotate, and—yeah.
Jack: How much...do you think—how long do you think a one hundred plus tax unlimited pasta pass lasts you?
Sylvi: I mean, I—I wanna say forever, but I feel like that’s—
Austin (overlapping): No, a hundred bucks—
Keith (overlapping): Right, it’s unlimited.
Austin (overlapping): —a hundred—a hundred—
Keith (overlapping): Unlimited means forever. 
Austin (overlapping): No, a hundred is—that’s, like, a single seating. A hundred? Dollars? Is no money. [Pause]
Keith: For—
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: —for Olive Garden?
Austin (overlapping): That’s—they’re not give you infinite—
Keith: Their pastas—
Jack: Okay—
Keith: —their pastas are fifteen dollars a plate. 
Austin (overlapping): Okay, in a month. 
Jack (overlapping): So he’s what I’ll—
Austin (overlapping): In a month, maybe. Maybe a week!
Jack: Here’s what I’ll tell you. Let me see if it changes things. 
Austin (overlapping): Yeah. 
Jack: The lifetime pasta pass costs five hundred dollars. 
Austin (overlapping): Oh. 
Sylvi: Okay!
Austin: Then a—[sigh]
Sylvi: I’m gonna with a year for the standard, then. 
Jack: Okay, Sylvi says a year. 
Sylvi (overlapping): If there is a separate lifetime one. 
Austin: How long does the lifetime one last?
[Pause]
Jack: (Laughing) Good question. 
Austin (overlapping): Because that’s how they get you. 
Keith: It expires—they come to your deathbed and they take it from you. [Laugh]
Austin (overlapping): Well, you know, we live in a world in which—
Keith (overlapping): And then you die. 
Austin (overlapping): —a company that—companies that make things like backpacks will say that there’s a lifetime guarantee, and they do not mean your lifetime. They mean the lifetime of the product. 
[Pause]
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: That’s—that’s how they get you. 
Jack: That sucks!
Austin (overlapping): Yes. And so, my question is, is this the lifetime of the person who eats the pasta, or a (laughing) lifetime of the pasta?
Jack: (Laughing) Of the pasta. 
Keith: There—I—the other way that people mean lifetime, though, is like a really long set amount of time, like fifty years. 
Austin: Right, well that—
Sylvi (overlapping): Yeah...
Jack (overlapping): Sure...
Austin (overlapping): Yeah. Yes. Exactly. [Pause] 
Jack: So...
Austin: I still wanna say—for a hundred bucks, maybe it’s a year. [Pause] 
Keith: Can I say this? I don’t—I don’t—I don’t very much like the Olive Garden. But if the lifetime five hundred dollar pasta pass is that good—
Austin (overlapping): Oh, I would get it. 
Keith: —I would—I might just go there every day—
Jack (overlapping): Yeah...
Keith: —and just get it. I’d just be like “Okay, that’s my food for the rest of my life.”
Austin (overlapping): So I feel like I’ve read this, and there are limits on the lifetime pass. 
Jack: Yeah...
Austin: There are things that are like “You can’t come every day.” 
Jack (overlapping): And they release a few of them, as well. 
Austin (overlapping): Yeah, they only release like six a year, or something, right? 
Jack (overlapping): (Laughing) “You can’t come every day.” Bullshit. Um...they release...[sigh]
Austin: I wanna google this, but I can’t, ‘cause I’ll find out if I’m—I’m gonna commit so I can google this. That’s what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna commit to a hundred dollars...is...
Keith (overlapping): To figuring this out? 
Austin: A hundred dollars for the—what is it, the unlimited pasta pass?
Jack: The never-ending pasta pass. 
Austin: Oh, that’s not unlimited. That’s different than never—never-ending and unlimited—
Jack: No...
Austin: —feel distinct. 
Jack: Well, so, (reading) “The never-ending pasta pass...”
Keith (overlapping): “Never-ending” seems like until the end of time. 
Jack: “...costs one hundred dollars plus tax [Keith chuckles] and offers guests tktktk of unlimited pastas and sauces from Olive Garden’s Never-Ending Pasta Bowl menu. The deal also comes with unlimited—”
Austin (overlapping): Okay, so there’s already—there’s already a limit. 
Jack: “—soup or salad and breadsticks.” There’s already a menu—yeah, uh-huh. 
Austin (overlapping): Because you can only buy from this limited menu. You can’t get any pasta. 
Jack (overlapping): I can’t go in there and say “One rotisserie chicken,” or something. 
Austin (overlapping): I mean, it’s a pasta. 
Keith: But I feel—I feel like that is—that’s always gonna be a part of it. It’s always gonna be “Unlimited from this list of stuff.”
Austin (overlapping): “From this list of basics.” So, like if they have a yearly special—
Keith (overlapping): Right. 
Austin: —lasagna, or a seasonal ravioli, that’s not gonna be on the unlimited list. 
Jack: And I want that, right?
Austin: To—you’re gonna have to pay...
Jack (overlapping): If someone says to me “This is our seasonal ravioli—”
Austin (overlapping): Yes.
Jack: —I’m like “Yes, please.” I’ll tell you—
Keith: They have...
Jack: (Reading) “One hundred dollars plus tax for the never-ending pasta pass offers guests nine weeks—”
Austin (overlapping): (Muffled) Okay. 
Jack: “—of unlimited (laughing) pasta—”
Austin (overlapping): So two—little over two months. 
Jack: Bullshit!
Austin: Uh-huh. 
[Pause]
Keith: That’s a lot of pasta, honestly!
Austin (overlapping): Is it daily? 
Jack: But compared to five hundred dollars? Is it daily? I don’t—I don’t know, is it daily? Um...(quieter) never-ending...
Keith: No, that’s the hundred-dollar one! The five hundred dollar one’s lifetime. Lifetime can’t be nine weeks. 
Jack (overlapping): Yeah, the five hundred dollar one’s—
Austin: No, that’s what—Jack is saying...
Jack: No, lifetime is—as far as I can tell...forever. [Pause] What I’m saying is the cost—the cost differential between one hundred for nine weeks, and (laughing) five hundred dollars for one human lifespan...[Keith laughs] is weird. 
Keith: Yeah. Well, it’s a combination of two things. It’s the combination of the gym membership scam, which is that you’ll sign up for a gym membership—
Austin: Right. 
Keith: —and then pay forever even though you end up not going.
Jack: Sure, uh-huh. 
Keith: And then, also, that pasta is basically free food. It doesn’t almost cost anything to make pasta. 
Jack: Yeah...(Reading) “Can I use the pass at Olive Garden locations outside of the continental United States?” Well I’m learning something new just by the question. [Austin laughs] Ugh, no. It is only valid (laughing) in the continental United States. 
Keith: That’s because nowhere except the United States needs something called a “Lifetime Unlimited Pasta Pass.” [Laugh]
Jack: I mean, honestly. I’d like one!
[Austin chuckles]
Keith: I kinda would like one too. 
Jack: But again, I’d like them to give me one—
Keith (overlapping): I haven’t been in years. They discontinued the only thing that I really liked from them. They had this, like, sweet pork dish. It was like the—it was like pork veneto, I think it was called. And it was like, this—this, like, you know, cut of very tender pork, and a couple decent sides, and it was like, you know, it was, like, thirteen bucks, and it was a totally fine dinner. And they got rid of it, and that was the only thing I ever really liked at the Olive Garden.
Austin (overlapping): Do you think that—
Jack: That’s quite—that’s quite sad. 
Austin (overlapping): Do you think that they—
Keith (overlapping): The breadsticks are so bad that I can’t—I mean—
Austin (overlapping): I don’t like the breadsticks. Yeah. Compared to like—
Keith: They make—they are so salty they made me cough. 
Austin (overlapping): Contrast that to the cheddar bay biscuits from Red Lobster, which are...
Jack: Oh!
Austin: ...so dense with butter—
Jack (overlapping): Never been to Red Lobster. 
Austin: —that they make you want to die—
Sylvi (overlapping): Oh my gosh...
Austin: —but you’ll eat another one. They’re so good. 
Sylvi (overlapping): They’re so good, is the thing...
Austin: You know—[sigh]
Jack: American casual...casual dining is great, [Keith and Austin laugh] actually. 
Keith: (Laughing) I big disagree. [Jack laughs] I hate it. [Austin laughs] I mean I go. I don’t not go. But I do hate it. I mean, there’s—there’s wildly varying quality. Like, you know, the...the 99 is different than the Olive Garden, fundamentally. 
Austin (overlapping): Uh-huh. 
Jack (overlapping): Sure. Yeah. 
Keith: Which is that the Olive Garden has—you know, maybe it has a steak that’s fine, but you sure shouldn’t have chicken there.
Jack: Yeah. Definitely.
Austin (overlapping): The Olive Garden steak—
Keith (overlapping): But the chicken at Olive Garden is fine.
Austin (overlapping): —when I was growing up—so I went through a period where I didn’t like pasta because I ate nothing but pasta (laughing) for a few years. Because we were broke as shit. 
Jack: Sure, that’ll do it. 
Austin: And so, when we got—
Sylvi (overlapping): Yeah...
Austin: —to the Olive Garden stage of, like—the Olive Garden-once-every-three-months stage, I was like “I’m getting a steak. I’m not eating pasta.” And they had a thing called the Tuscan T-bone that I loved. And I don’t think it’s on the menu anymore, but it was great. 
Keith: Yeah, they get rid of all the good stuff. Whenever someone genuinely likes something—
Austin (overlapping): Mhm. 
Keith: —they find out and they get rid of it. [Laugh]
Austin (overlapping): That’s how it works. The—here’s the other way that the—
Keith (overlapping): Yeah.
Austin: —that the lifetime pass thing works, is you have to buy a never-ending pasta pass to be eligible for the lifetime. 
Jack: Yes. Uh-huh.
Austin: They release twenty-four thousand never-ending pasta passes—the nine week passes.
Keith: Oh...
Sylvi (overlapping): Oh my god!
Austin (overlapping): You have to buy one of those, and then—
Keith: But, it’s an upgrade. 
Austin: Exactly. Exactly. The first fifty pasta pass holders...
Keith (overlapping): It’s not a—one hundred, then five hundred.
Austin: If you’re one of the first fifty to get the twenty-four thousand—one of the twenty-four thousand, then you can upgrade. You’re notified that you’re one of the first fifty—it’s like a sneaker drop—and you can get the upgrade, to...
Jack: (Laughing) Hype beast—Olive Garden hype beast.
Austin: And at that point, you’re gonna say yes, right? Because you’re gonna be like “Whoa—”
Jack: Yeah! Of course you would!
Austin (overlapping): “—I was one of the first fifty? Hell yeah I’m gonna try to get the...lifetime pass.”
[Pause]
Keith: I think I’m gonna try this. 
Austin (overlapping): They next time they do these—the next drop...
Keith: The next drop, I gotta—I gotta try for it. 
Austin: Hundred bucks. Hundred bucks to get in the drawing. 
Keith (overlapping): Yeah. That’s—I mean...
Jack: Sort of buy into the ticket, yeah...
Keith: If I—if I can commit to being just like—
Austin (overlapping): How many meals...
Keith (overlapping): —an Olive Garden person...
Austin (overlapping): Yeah, that’s the thing is, how many meals is it [Sylvi and Keith laugh] before it pays for itself? 
Keith: I can save some genuine money. 
Austin: You can—you have to have...bought five hundred dollars' worth of basic pasta meals from Olive Garden before it pays for itself. 
Jack: Well, so, here’s the thing—
Austin (overlapping): Do you see what I’m saying? 
Jack: [Laugh] Or you have to have bought five hundred pounds’ worth of meals—dollars’ worth of meals, right?
Austin: No. 
Jack: Of food. 
Keith: Oh my god. 
Austin: No. Wait, what are you—
Keith (overlapping): This is a very funny sentence. 
Jack: Well, if I’m eating every single meal at the Olive Garden—
Austin: Yes.
[Pause]
Jack: I’m not—I’m not doing a food shop. [Pause]
Austin: You’re—so you’re, like, in the Olive Garden every night—
Jack (overlapping): Like I’m not buying my...
Austin: —in this scenario. You’re eating rigatoni—
Jack (overlapping): Yes! Sick!
Austin (overlapping): —(mispronounces) cavtapi—or, cavatappi, spaghetti, angel hair, gluten-free rotini, or fettuccine every night. ‘Cause those are—that’s what you get. 
Jack: Uh-huh!
Austin: That’s it. 
Jack: Yes? 
Keith: Yeah. 
Jack: Uh-huh. 
Austin (overlapping): Maybe you can get meatballs on top—
Keith (overlapping): Okay, this is fun. Here’s the—
Austin: —maybe you get Italian sausage on top. Maybe you get good old chicken, or—
Jack (overlapping): That’s a little treat for me. [Laugh] 
Austin: But that’s it! 
[Dre laughs]
Jack: Yup. 
Keith: Oh, and let’s not forget about—you’re paying tip—
Austin (overlapping): And you’re paying tips every night. 
Jack (overlapping): I call it “Jack’s hell.”
Keith (overlapping): —every night, you’ve paid full price for this.
Dre (overlapping): That one’s for Jacks. 
Austin (overlapping): And drinks. There’s not drinks on this. [Jack laughs] You don’t get free drinks.
Jack: And drinks. Yeah.
Austin: And if you’re there with someone else—
Jack: Right. 
Austin: You don’t pay, they do. 
Keith (overlapping): I’ll have the water, thanks. [Pause] Yeah. So, this is what—this is what some of the Facebook commenters have figured out. People calculating for their whole family, quote “For a mere twenty-five hundred dollars, we can all eat at OG every night for the rest of our lives. At a dollar a box of pasta, it’s paid for itself in less than seven years.” 
[Austin laughs, Sylvi groans, Keith cracks up]
Austin: See, this is the thing. 
Sylvi: Oh, no...
Austin: Uh-huh. This is the thing. 
Dre: God...
Sylvi: That is...that is—ugh...
Austin (overlapping): There’s not even enough things on this menu to have a different basic pasta every night of the week. You’re looping in a week.
Keith: That’s the problem. 
Austin: In under a week. Every six days—
Keith (overlapping): Yeah.
Austin: —you loop back around. 
Keith: And...
Sylvi: Why would...
Keith: So that’s the problem, and then you’re also factoring in—
Austin (overlapping): Yeah.
Keith: —that you’ve got to tip the waiter, and that’s gonna be money...
Austin (overlapping): That’s still cheaper than groceries, I get it. 
Keith (overlapping): ...and then, on top of that...
Austin: But like, you’re gonna need groceries for other meals, you’re not gonna, like, roll into the Olive Garden three—
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Right?
Dre (overlapping): God, I hope you do. 
Jack: You’re a coward, Austin.
Keith: And then it’s like—
Austin (overlapping): Salad isn’t even involved—isn’t even in here—
Keith: —it’s so...
[Jack laughs]
Austin: You don’t even get a salad. 
Keith: They do free salad and breadsticks. 
Austin: Oh, okay. Okay. 
Keith: Don’t they?
Austin: Okay. Okay. Okay. Unlimited—yeah. 
Keith: Yeah. That’s why the breadsticks are so bad—
Austin (overlapping): Eh, you know what, unlimited servings of soup—
Keith (overlapping): —and the salads only have one slice of tomato unless you ask. 
Austin (overlapping): —of soup or salad and breadsticks, that’s not—you know what? I’m back on—I’m back in. [Laugh]
Jack: The soup—how often is the soup gonna change? 
Keith: Yeah, I’ve—
Austin (overlapping): I’m back. 
Dre (overlapping): [Laugh] Austin’s back!
[Jack laughs]
Keith: And I’m out. I believed—I imagine that they have several soups a day. 
Austin: That’s what I’m saying. The soup might save this for me. 
Jack: (overlapping): Ooh...sure. 
Keith (overlapping): Yeah. 
Keith: Yeah. And—and, uh...I’m back out, because I’m thinking now how cheap it is to just make pasta at my house. 
Austin (overlapping): Dirt cheap. 
Keith: And I can make a delicious red sauce—
Austin: Yes.
Keith: —in like, twenty minutes, so...
Jack: How much pasta could five hundred (laughing) dollars buy me at Costco?
Austin: Enough for a year. Like, enough for—just pasta?
Keith: Yeah. Just pasta. Well, you can get—you can get pasta for a dollar a box. You can get pasta for three dollars a box. You can get pasta for seven dollars a box.
Austin (overlapping): Yeah, and each of those boxes is more than one meal worth of pasta, frankly. 
Jack: Oh, yeah, totally.
Austin (overlapping): You know what I mean? So...
Keith (overlapping): Right, it’s like three. At least. Yeah.
Austin: You’re good, for...
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: A while. 
Keith: I like to—I like to buy the slightly more expensive pasta, and then save money by making my own sauce.
Austin (overlapping): Sure, that makes sense. 
Keith: And then my own sauce is better than the can-bought sauce, anyway. 
Sylvi (overlapping): (Muffled) Yeah...
Keith: It’s just—it’s just tomatoes—
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: —and stuff. You get—you get crushed—you get—not crushed, you get whole tomatoes, take out the middle bits that are kind of yellow, and then you get a big thing of sauce for the—for, you know—and then put salt and oil in it, and you’re done. 
Sylvi (overlapping): This is the secret the Italians have been hiding. It’s just tomatoes.
Keith: Yeah, they’ve been hiding that you can make—-you can make tomato sauce out of tomatoes. 
Jack (overlapping):  [Laugh] It’s just tomato.
Sylvi (overlapping): It’s just tomatoes!
[Austin laughs]
Keith (overlapping): It’s just tomatoes.
Austin: They don’t want you to know! 
Keith: (Laughing) They really—
Austin: They don’t.
Keith: —it’s just tomatoes!
[Jack laughs]
Jack: You go to a new land, and you say—
Keith (overlapping): They don’t—what, they don’t hide that?
Austin (overlapping): They don’t want you to know. 
Jack (overlapping): —“What’s in this?” 
[Austin laughs]
Keith: Yeah, oh okay, (laughing) they don’t want you to know. [Austin laughs] “What’s in this tomato sauce? It tastes delicious.”
Jack: Who could say?
Keith: Who could say? Yeah, we don’t know. 
Jack (overlapping): British person coming here and asking us what’s in our tomato sauce? No. 
Keith: It comes from a can—just one day tomato sauce—cans of tomato sauce started showing up [Austin chuckles] and we just dumped it on our pasta, [Jack laughs] and now we’re famous. 
[Austin continues laughing]
Jack: I think I’m just compelled by whenever someone says “If you give us X amount of money, you can have this...forever?”
Austin: Forever. Yeah, sure. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Jack: ‘Cause futurity is compelling. It’s as frightening as it is compelling. 
Keith (overlapping): I do have...I do have a little bit of a—I do have a bit of an angle on that, Jack. And that’s what a store is. (Laughing) That’s what every store says. 
[Jack and Austin laugh, then Keith cracks up]
Jack: “You give us a little bit of money...” Uh-huh. [Keith continues laughing] (Muffled) Yeah. I’m gonna have it forever. 
Keith: I’m—I’m gonna buy—I’m gonna buy a chain of retail stores and I’m going to change all the marketing to say, like—like “Look, you can—you can—you can have this book. But if you give us X amount of money, you can have it [Austin laughs] forever.” 
Jack: Forever. We—[laugh] we won’t come and take it—
Keith (overlapping): Forever. 
Jack: —away from you. [Keith laughs] [Groan] We’re calling it “sale.” [Austin laughs] It’s a new concept we’ve invented. [Austin continues laughing] [Pause] Why are you rolling a d100’s Austin? Was that at the end of the last session?
Austin: Yeah. You’ll—maybe, you’ll find out. I don’t know. That was not connected [Sylvi laughs] to anything you saw. I ended up not using them anyway, so it doesn’t matter.
Jack (overlapping): Oh, you just—you just...
Austin: I was rolling something on a chart.
Jack (overlapping): ...decided to (laughing) roll some d100’s at the end—
Austin (overlapping): I was rolling on a d—on a hundred-sided chart—
Jack: Oh, sure.
Austin: —for something, but I’m probably—
Sylvi (overlapping): Yeah...
Austin: —I probably made choices that were not in line with that anyway. Um, should we time.is?
Jack: (Yawning) Let’s do it. 
Keith: Yeah.
Jack: I just realized, sitting down to record—
Sylvi (overlapping): Sure. 
Jack: —that my desktop background is a Stålenhag picture. 
Austin: Wow. Which one?
Keith: Really?
Dre: (Intrigued) Mmm...
Jack: It’s a...the...kid carrying a PC monitor into a house, and there’s a massive ship floating in the sky behind him.
Austin (overlapping): Ah, that’s a good one. Yeah. 
Keith: My desktop background’s Goku from Dragon Ball Z. 
Jack: Hell yeah!
Dre (overlapping): Hell yeah.
Austin (overlapping): It’s Goku. [Laugh]
Sylvi (overlapping): I have...the default factory one...
Jack (overlapping): Carrying a PC (laughing) monitor into a house...[laugh] What’s that?
Sylvi: I still have my default, like, factory one. I still haven’t changed it. 
Austin (overlapping): Sylvi! [Keith laughs] Sylvi. 
Jack: Damn. 
Keith: Really? That doesn’t—that doesn’t seem like you. 
Austin (overlapping): No, that doesn’t seem like you. 
Sylvi (overlapping): I know!
Austin (overlapping): Are you the real Sylvi?
Jack: We could—Sylvi, we could take five minutes now. [Laugh] We could—
Sylvi (overlapping): No, it’s alright. 
Keith (overlapping): Yeah, do you want to take some time to pick a background?
Sylvi: I’m gonna think way too much about this. On my old desktop...
Keith: (overlapping): I’m sure you could find, like, Jar-Jar Binks as a catboy if you want. 
Sylvi: Oh, god. Why would I want that, Keith?
Keith: I don’t know, that just seems like something you’d do. [Laugh]
Austin: Wow. 
Sylvi: I mean the catboy thing, kind of...but...
Keith: Yeah. Well, you would—here’s what it is. Here’s what it feels like—is that you would find a desktop background that someone else would say “Why would you do that?” to you. 
[Sylvi cracks up] 
Austin: Did you know that in “Legends”—
[Timestamp 00:15:00]
Sylvi: Fair. 
Austin: —Anakin was friends with someone named Catboy, who was...
Sylvi: No fucking way!
Austin (overlapping): ...this cat character? [Laugh]
[Keith laughs]
Jack (overlapping): Absolutely not. No. He was a—he was a cat character?
Austin: (Reading) “Catboy was an unidentified child of a feline species who lived in Mos Espa, Tatooine. He counted Anakin Skywalker and W. Wald—” who is a—who is a Rodian...
Jack (overlapping): Oh! It’s—it’s Garfield! 
[Keith laughs]
Sylvi: Oh my god!
Austin (overlapping): Yeah, it’s a Garfield.
Keith: [Laugh] Unidentified according to “Legends” or unidentified even to Anakin?
[Austin and Jack laugh] 
Austin: I think Anakin knew!
Jack: “I don’t know who he is!”
Keith: I don’t know, they called him Catboy—
Austin: Uh-huh.
Keith: —so maybe not. 
Austin: Anyway, I did a search for “Jar Jar catboy” and did not find a single catboy Jar Jar. 
Dre: Yeah, there’s nothing. 
Jack: Bullshit! 
Keith: Well I guess that’s why it’s none of our backgrounds. 
Austin (overlapping): Right. That’s why. Someone has to fix this. [Sigh] God. Alright. We should clap. 
Jack: Let’s do it. 
Austin: Uh, let’s do...let’s do thirty?
[Pause]
[Several discordant claps]
Austin: Alright. 
Jack: Oh, yikes!
Austin: What?
Keith: Something wrong?
Jack: Sounded like three separate claps to me—
Austin: Uh-oh. 
Jack: —but I...
Keith: It did not sound like a great clap.
Austin (overlapping): Okay, we can do another one.
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: Uh...let’s do forty-eight. 
[Pause]
[Several discordant claps]
Austin: That...
Keith: That one was a little...
Austin: ...that was way worse—
[Jack laughs]
Keith: That was still bad. 
Austin: —than the first one to me. It’ll be fine. [Jack continues laughing] Thank you Ali. 
[Pause] 
Keith: I had a good—good espresso before we started. That’s always a nice one when I do it right. 
Dre: Oh, that sounds...wonderful. 
Keith (overlapping): I feel like I’ve had this machine for, like, ten months now, and I’m still...like, not (laughing) a hundred percent on it.
Austin: Hmm.
Keith: It’s hard. Espresso is hard to do...
Austin (overlapping): Yeah...um...okay. 
[Transition music] 
Jack: Oh my god! So here’s the fucking thing...[sigh] I’ve been playing Super Mario 3D World, which I was playing for the first time when we were recording the first ever episode of Friends at the Table? In 2014?
Austin (overlapping): Oh, wow...
Sylvi (overlapping): Oh, wow. 
Jack: I mean, not as we were—
Austin (overlapping): The energy.
Jack: —not as we were playing. That—you know. Before, or whatever. [Ali laughs] And...I hit a level that I had not played before—’cause I didn’t get all the way through the game, and it’s called “Chain Link Charge.” And it is an—
Ali: (Quiet) Oh...
Jack: —auto scroller. So—[laugh] so those suck, first of all. And it requires you to be like cat Mario climbing up and down these chain links—
Austin: (Quiet) Oh...
Jack: —as the level is scrolling. I went into this level with twenty one-up mushrooms. Like twenty life, or whatever.
Austin: Lives, yeah.
Jack: And I left it—I left it with five. 
Austin: Mmh. 
Jack: Like, this level is (laughing) so hard. [Austin laughs] And I got it in the end, but I was—I’m...I’m not a controller-throwy or break-y person, [sound of dice rolling] but I was sitting there like—I was steamed. 
Austin: Oof. 
Jack: Not having a good time with the—[sigh] with that little plumber.
Austin: (Laughing) I am sorry. 
Jack: Fuck that guy. [Laugh] Although, [Austin laughs] I think the next level is a Boo—is a ghost house or whatever, so that’ll be cute. 
Austin (overlapping): Oh, those are fun. Yeah, ghost houses are—
Jack (overlapping): Yeah! You know, I love Mario games. I think they’re really exciting. It is just really funny that, like, past a certain point they’re just like “And then we’re gonna (laughing) hit you in the head with a hammer.”
Austin: (Laughing) Mhm.
Ali: Mmm...
Austin: Hm. One second, I’m gonna finish eating a snack. 
Ali: Oooh, what’s the snack?
Austin: A donut. 
Jack: Oh my god!
Ali: [Gasp] Snack talk! Ooh. 
Austin: I got a donut this morning. I saved it for now. I got a glazed donut. 
Ali: That’s so smart...
Austin: Mhm. [Ali laughs] Thank you. I thought really hard [Ali laughs] about it. Yeah...
Jack: Professional podcaster. 
Austin: I was like “I’m gonna get a breakfast sandwich, and also one donut. For right before the podcast.”
Ali (overlapping): Yeah...that’s the stuff. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Jack: I have two thirds of the theme pretty much—pretty much finished. They, like—
Austin (overlapping): Hell yeah. 
Jack (overlapping): —need business on them. 
Ali (overlapping): (Sing-song) So exciting...
Jack: I don’t know what the last third is, and I’m just hoping that I’m gonna write up to it, in terms of measures, and then I’ll know. But right now I have—
Austin (overlapping): Mmm...
Jack: —no idea what the back end of this thing is. Um...but it’s going really well. There’s a lot more...I spent today trying to fix, like, a bunch of tempo errors that were in the demos, Austin. Where it’s like—
Austin: Ooh, yeah. Uh-huh. 
Jack: I want it to sound off-kilter, but I want people to be able to track where the beats are. 
Austin: Right. 
Jack: And so, it was one of those days where it was, like, no real forward progress but I’ll be grateful that I made those...(laughing) edits. 
Austin: Yeah—yeah, when it’s time to listen to it. Mhm. 
Ali (overlapping): Beats-schmeats. [Laugh]
Jack: (Laughing) What’s that, Ali? 
Ali: Do whatever you—I said beats-schmeats. You should do whatever you want. 
Jack: Beach meats?
Ali: Nobody needs to hear those...
Jack (overlapping): Oh! Oh. Oh. I see, I see. 
Austin (overlapping): “Beach meats” is a—means a different thing. You can’t say “beach meats.”
[Ali laughs in the background] 
Jack: Yeah, beats-schmeats. 
Austin (overlapping): What’s—
Jack: Who needs ‘em?
Sylvi: I’m so confused right now. 
Ali (overlapping): Yeah...beats...
Austin: What?
Ali: ...beats comma....
Jack: With—with—
Ali: ...schmeats...
Jack: We got in the weeds. [Ali laughs]
Austin: We’re gone. This is—we’re off of this one. [Ali continues laughing] What’s it called when a—when, like, a flower dies again? Like a flower—like there’s a verb?
Ali: Wilting? 
Austin: Wilting. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
Jack: Austin, writing down “kill flower.” 
Austin: Kill flower. Uh, this is—this is for a tweet. Not for a—not for what we’re about to do. 
Jack: Oh, sure. 
Austin: Alright, I’m ready to time.is.
Sylvi: Okay. 
Jack (overlapping): Let’s do it. 
Ali: Ooh. Time.is...
Sylvi: [Chuckle] Jesus...
Austin: Uh-oh. 
Ali: Goodbye, emails...
Austin: Bye emails. 
Jack: You see this Tolstoy quote? 
Austin: I do see this Tolstoy quote. “Time and patience are the strongest warriors.”
Ali: It’s true. 
Austin: Who’s the third strongest?
Sylvi: (Laughing) Goku. 
Austin: Goku.
Jack: Yes. 
[Everyone laughs loudly] 
Ali: I mean, duh. 
Austin: Oh...boy...
[Laughter continues]
Jack: Tolstoy said that too, right?
Dre (overlapping): I hope everyone was recording for that. 
Sylvi: I was recording. 
Austin: Okay. Good. 
[Laughter dies down, starts up again]
Jack: [Laugh] Anna Karenina...
Austin: It’s true, though. Goku—
Dre: It is!
Austin: Think about Goku in the [Ali laughs] hyperbolic time ch—time chamber. 
Dre: Uh-huh.
[Ali laughs]
Austin: Being patient as he gets stronger...
Ali: Uh-huh...
Dre: As he flew to Namek—
Sylvi: Yeah...
Dre: —and just trained the whole time? 
Austin: Uh-huh. 
Ali: Twenty seconds. 
Sylvi: Okay. 
Austin: I closed time.is. I was done with it. 
[Dre, Jack and Ali laugh]
Ali: (High pitched) You what? [Several claps in the background] Why would you do that?
Austin: I got it! I got there for twenty. 
Jack: I didn’t clap. 
[Sylvi and Ali laugh]
Ali: (High pitched) Did you close?
Austin: ‘Cause we were done. ‘Cause we read the quote. The most important part. 
[Laughter continues]
Dre: Yeah.
Austin: I heard about Goku...
Jack (overlapping): She’s just, like, eyeballs...
Dre: Just thinkin’ ‘bout Goku!
Austin: Mhm. 
[Ali and Sylvi continue laughing]
Sylvi: Oh my god...
[Ali laughs]
Dre: Can’t clap, thinking about Goku.
Austin (overlapping): Forty-five. Forty-five. Yeah.
Ali: Okay, yeah. 
Dre: Forty-five. 
[Pause]
[Loud, synchronized clap]
Sylvi: Great start. 
Austin (overlapping): I think Goku would be really good at clapping. 
Sylvi: Oh my gosh...
Dre (overlapping): Oh, he would be.
Ali: Oh, yeah. [Laugh]
Austin: That would be sick. Um...
Dre: Instant transmission his hands together. 
Austin: Yeah...boom! And then that would be it...[Ali laughs] for you...buddy...
[Dre and Austin laugh]
Sylvi (overlapping): I searched “Goku clapping” and I got a finger—picture of Goku giving the finger. 
[Austin, Jack, and Sylvi laugh]
Austin: Good. Good.
Sylvi (overlapping): Good. 
Dre: Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. 
Austin: That’s Goku Black. I think.
Ali (overlapping): Mhm. 
Sylvi (overlapping): Oh, okay, I don’t watch Super, so...
Austin: Me either, but I know who Goku Black is, [Ali laughs] ‘cause I fear for my life, and I need to know...
Sylvi (overlapping): That’s fair. I just, like—I’m sure I’d know if I played the fighting game or something. 
Austin: That’s actually why. Um...where’s my—where is my fucking...
Dre: I can, uh—you know, if you got Goku Black questions, I can fill you in. 
[Sylvi laughs]
Austin: Thank you. 
Sylvi: It’s—it’s, like, another guy...in Goku’s body...right? I feel like I—
Austin (overlapping): No.
Sylvi: Or, okay—
Austin: It’s not that—no...no. I think you’re thinking of...
Sylvi (overlapping): I thought that’s what—what it was. Like, not like Goku—
Austin (overlapping): You’re thinking about...
Sylvi: —not like Goku is taken over like a Ginyu situation...
Austin: Mmm...mhm. 
Sylvi: But like, this guy’s got, like—is in, like, Goku’s form somehow. 
Dre: Yes.
Sylvi: Okay, yeah. (Muffled) Why do I know that?
Austin: Do you want to explain the Goku Black situation? 
Dre: Uh, I believe—okay, so it is—
Sylvi (overlapping): I feel like I did a good job. [Laugh]
Dre: You did. Specifically it is an apprentice Kai—and this is one of the apprentice gods in training—
Sylvi: Okay. 
Dre: —thinks that, like, the role of the gods is to rule, like, humanity and other, like, non-godlike species with, like, an iron hand. And then he sees Goku show up and just, like—Goku beats the fucking shit out of him in a sparring match, and he freaks out [Sylvi laughs] and so then he wishes to become Goku to kill Goku. 
Austin: And he becomes a Goku from a different universe, right? Because our Goku is still Goku. 
Dre (overlapping): Oh, maybe. 
Austin: That’s how they can fight each other. That’s a—
Ali: Oh...
Austin: There’s, like, eight different universes or something and he becomes...he becomes, like, universe six Goku, or whatever. 
Sylvi: God, see—
Dre: Yeah...
Sylvi: —this is where they lose me. Too many Gokus.
Dre (overlapping): Yeah...okay, well, yeah. He becomes—I don’t know if he becomes a different Goku—
Austin (overlapping): Mmm...okay. 
Dre (overlapping): —but he, like, exists in the universe that is, like, the pocket universe that was created when Trunks went back in time and changed the timeline.
Austin: Oh my god...
[Ali laughs]
Sylvi: Okay, if they’re doing funny timeline shit, I might be back in. 
Austin: Okay. Well, and...
Dre (overlapping): Yeah. It’s—it’s future Trunks, man. Hell yeah.
Austin (overlapping): And he goes Super Saiyan Rosé, so...
Ali: Mhm. 
Dre: Yes he does.
Jack (overlapping): Rose? 
Sylvi (overlapping): Okay...
Austin (overlapping): ...it’s the best shit in the world...
Dre: Uh-huh. 
Ali: Yeah...
Austin: It’s the pink-haired Goku. It’s sick.
Sylvi: Yeah, no. It’s...it’s—they made it so you could make a trans flag out of Gokus.
Austin: That’s correct, yes. [Ali and Jack laugh] That was their intention. 
Sylvi: Yeah...
Dre: God you’re right. Jesus. 
[Austin laughs]
Austin: It’s—yeah. Uh-huh. [Sylvi laughs] All of Dragon Ball Super—if you take all the different super forms, right—
Dre (overlapping): Uh-huh. Yeah. 
Austin (overlapping): ‘Cause there’s—the Ultra Instinct is white—
Dre: Uh-huh. 
Austin: —and then there’s Super Saiyan Blue Super Saiyan. Super Saiyan God—wait, it’s Super Saiyan God. 
Sylvi: I think that’s Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. ‘Cause I think that was—
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvi: —in one of the Xenoverse games. That sounds familiar. 
Dre: They’re the same thing. So it’s either Super Saiyan Blue, which I think is the English way to say it—
Austin: Oh, okay. 
Dre: —and then...the Japanese translation to English is Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. 
Sylvi: Which I love. 
Austin (overlapping): That’s better. That’s so fucking good. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: Shut the fuck up, ??? 
[Timestamp 00:25:00]
Dre (overlapping): Because Super Saiyan God is a different thing than Super Saiyan Blue. That’s red hair. Red hair is Super Saiyan God. 
Austin: I see. So if you’re both Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan, then you’re Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan.
Dre: Yeah, it’s a Super Saiyan God that has gone Super Saiyan.
Sylvi Oh, man—
Austin: Yup. 
Sylvi: —I know I said I wasn’t into Super, [Austin laughs] but I might have to check out Dragon Ball Super...
Dre: Uh, Super has some, like, ups and downs in terms of quality. But when it hits, it is good Dragon Ball. [Laugh] 
Sylvi (overlapping): I’ve seen the episode where Vegeta, Trunks, and Bulma go on a family vacation, [Ali laughs] and that’s it. 
Dre: Uh-huh. 
Sylvi: And I felt like I got everything I needed out of it, but this sounds alright. 
[Chair squeaks]
Austin: One day I’ll get there. Okay! I’m ready to do a podcast. 
Sylvi (overlapping): Okay. 
[Outro music begins]
