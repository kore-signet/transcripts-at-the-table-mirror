Transcriber: happierstories#8865


AUSTIN: Art, you're so small that we cannot hear you when you talk right now.


ART: (very small but yelling) well, it's coming through on Audacity so it'll be great in post!


AUSTIN: (unconvinced) Ok. (JACK chuckles) 


JANINE: Mm. Will it, when no one responds or acknowledges the things? 


KEITH: It'll be Art's secret little jokes. 


JANINE: Everyone'll be like, "Oh they're so mean to Art during the finale, what the hell?" (background laughter) (cross) "They're just ignoring everything he's saying!"


JACK: (cross) That's 'cause we cannot hear him.


AUSTIN: (laughing) Oh, it's so rough.


SYLVIA: (over Art) "Why did Sovereign Immunity get the poison mushroom power up from Mario at the beginning?"


ART: (under Sylvia) It's not true! I have sound (unintelligible) (KEITH cackles)


AUSTIN: It's happening as we speak, I can hear Art trying to say something and I can't hear him. 


ART: (distantly yelling) THEY'RE LYING TO YOU!!


(laughter)


AUSTIN: Uh, anyway, Broun, you wanna continue with your goal?


(clip 2) 00:45 


KEITH: Okay. Yeah.


AUSTIN: Do we wanna deal with Art now or do we wanna save Art for last?


ART: (basically through the entire first few bits he is projecting loud) I see how it is, Austin!


(Sylvia and Jack laugh)


ALI: Oh, god, we should save Art for last, (cross) 'cause we might all have to... yeah


AUSTIN: (cross) Let's save Art for last, then.


ART: I knew it, I knew you guys-- (AUSTIN giggles) I knew this day was coming! (background giggling)


ALI: It'd be funnier if it wasn't deeply concerning.


(SYLVIA laughs)


AUSTIN: Yeah, uh-huh. It'd be funnier if we would-- Are we gonna get to do this today? We'll find out.


ALI: Yeah.


SYLVIA: Yeah...


ART: Tears of a clown!!!
 
(pause)


JANINE: "Here's a clown"?


AUSTIN: (overlap) Wait--


JACK: "Tears of a clown" (laughing)


(ALI laughs)


JANINE: Oh (laughing)


AUSTIN: Tears of a clown, right yeah sure. 


(clip 3) 01:22 


JANINE: Skin, skin chat update. 


DRE: Oh?


ALI: Oh hi.


SYLVIA: Hm?


JANINE: One, I'm a clown, I realized I'm a clown, because I-- One of the joke ingredients I made fun of in that clapcast was, I made like a joke about like, "Ceramidan!" (background snorts) And, the moisturizer and toner I use now have ceramidin,


ALI: Oh!


DRE: Oh. Mm!


JANINE: With an I. So... You know,


KEITH: Is it good?


JANINE: Point one, on makeup on my face. Oh, it's quite nice, yeah. It's a good toner. I'm not a toner believer, but this is-- This is like a, this toner is almost like a serum. 


ALI: Oh.


JANINE: That's something that means something to some people here. (laughs)


ALI: Yeah, I get a toner recently that's like, way thick-- 'Cause they're usually really watery, (JANINE: Mm-hm) but I got one that like, I have to really wiggle to get out of the thing?


JANINE: Oh.


ALI: It's very nice, I like it.


JANINE: What brand is it? What is it?


ALI: It's Innisfree's green tea toner?


JANINE: Ooh. Yeah, I'm using (cross) the, 


DRE: (cross) Ohh, I've heard of that place.


JANINE: (cont) Dr. Jart ceramidin set? (ALI giggles) Which, I think the Korean brands are into thick toners now. I think that's like a thing. So that makes sense to me that it's Innisfree. The other... So like, the big, big, BIG clown energy, um. (ALI snorts) I... found a Black Friday sale on a thing I'd been looking at for a long time, and I finally got it. And it's very foolish? The thing it does, is, it's like for-- They have little mask pads, and it's like a mask thing, but you can also use it to apply your serums and stuff. And it heats-- there's like a hot mode, and a cold mode, it's like a little puck in your hand and it gets very cold very fast and I don't understand how, it's magic as far as I'm concerned?


DRE: Woah.


ALI: (overlapping) Woww.


JANINE: (overlapping) But it also gets super hot?


KEITH: (overlapping) Wait, it's a puck that gets hot and cold?


JANINE: Yeah, it's like, a little puck. And also it has a ring of LED lights and the LED lights, different colors of LED lights are supposed to help you in different ways, (ALI cackles) which sounds... just like, 


SYLVIA: Magical!


JANINE: In space, it's (laughs)


ALI: God. When you started the sentence I thought that you were going to tell all of us that you got a little skincare refrigerator, which would've been (crosstalk) completely respectable.


DRE: (cross) Wow, that sounds powerful.


JANINE: (cross) No, I refuse, I refuse to do the tiny fridge, I just think it's such a waste of energy. Just to have cold product.


ALI: I want one soo bad, but it's just... it's just, yeah.


JANINE: But also, this thing like, gets cold, so if I wanna have cold shit on my face, I can still do that.


ALI: Yeah. What's the idea there, is that it like, I guess, you put on hot stuff to open up your pores, and then you put the cold thing on to... ?


JANINE: Yeah, so, like... The, it has the...


KEITH: To be fair, IcyHot has been doing hot and cold for a long time.


(ALI giggles)


JANINE: Very different, do not put IcyHot on your face, for the love of god.


DRE: Oh, god, please do not.


SYLVIA: (mischievous) You sure?


JANINE: Oh, boy, no. 


ART: (under Keith) My face might be sore.


KEITH: Well, it's not for skincare, but I'm sure some genius looked at IcyHot and said "We can make that for your face."


JANINE: But it's like a machine, it's not a cream that's doing it. 


ALI: Can you send me the link to this?


KEITH: Oh, it's a mechanical puck, (JAN: Yeah, yeahyeahyeah) not like a puck of something.


JANINE: no yeahyeahyeah, so, the thing I got is the Foreo UFO 2? Which... It's so gimmicky and bullshit, I ignored Foreo stuff for so long, because I was like, all of this is overpriced. This is all a fucking scam. (overlapping) But then like, a bunch of skincare youtubers I'm actually kind of into...


KEITH: (overlapping) Can you link a picture, I wanna see a picture of it. Ok you already did.


ALI: (overlapping) Yeah, they also make those-- vibrating cleansers...


JANINE: were like... "Hey actually this thing's great." But it has like, these little mask things, then it has a little routine for the mask, and there's an app on your phone that walks you through, and it vibrates, and stuff. And it has all of these different-- You can change the light color, all these different things, and like, as far as I know... The only one that has any credible research on it is red light. Red light apparently... something something renews skin cells something activates mitochondrial something because it penetrates deeply, and... There's--


DRE: Sure.


KEITH: Regeneron!


JACK: That sounds pretty good.


JANINE: (laughs) I looked up, like, "What the fuck is the red light thing, is this real?" And I found a bunch of stuff on medical websites that I more or less trust being like, "Yeah, it does some stuff! And also we shined it up the nose of dementia patients and it helped them kinda (JACK: Oh, yeah!) and we don't know why!"


SYLVIA: Oh-kay!


JANINE: They straight up say, "We don't know why it does anything," (laughs) So great.


KEITH: Yeah. That's always the best stuff. There's a lot of that with tea? 


JANINE: Oh yeah.


KEITH: Tea's full of a lot of stuff, where people are like, (ALI: Oh, yeah.) "Yeah, anybody who's trying to tell you that tea does something is lying, but also, there is a lot of stuff in it, and we sure don't know how it works!"


JANINE: Yeah. So there's a lot of like... There are a lot of people who say "Oh, the green light does this! and the blue light does this!" And I dunno if I'm buying any of that. 'Cause the research I do not think is there. But. It is amazing that this little thing that fits in your hand, and you just charge it up with a USB cord, gets super cold, and you just like... 


KEITH: How does it get cold?


JANINE: I don't know! I cannot--


KEITH: Is it just because it's metal and metal gets cold?


JANINE: No, it like, gets cold. It gets cold like a pop can that's been out of the fridge for like, 20 minutes or so. Like it doesn't get super super cold, but it gets noticeably cold (KEITH: Right.) in the span of a few seconds. (cross) And it doesn't make any sound,


KEITH: (cross) It feels refrigerated. 


JANINE: Yeah. It feels, that's why the skincare fridge doesn't make sense to me anymore, because it's like, it is like I just took this thing out of the fridge basically.


KEITH: Mm. What if they got, um,


JANINE: And I love it, but it's... weird and... kind of scammy, it's-- I dunno, I dunno.


KEITH: How much is it?


JANINE: Oh, it's expensive (laughs)


KEITH: Oh it-- wow, it sure is. (cackles)


JANINE: Uh-huh. I would not have fucking gotten this thing if it was not on sale, let me tell you.


KEITH: Yeah.


JANINE: I'll take a hundred bucks off anything, let me tell you that, but.


ALI: Yeah...


KEITH: Yeah.


JANINE: But yikes, also.


ALI: I... yeah, this brand is so weird, 'cause definitely they have all those like, "Here's a thing for your face and it vibrates while it cleans it, and that... does a thing," and I'm like, I don't know about that.


JAN: Yeah, I have, I got like


K: What color did you get?


JANINE: I got the mint one, 'cause I, the pink was a bit too much. I have a knock-off of one of their cleaning things? And it's fine, 'cause it's just a silicone thing with bristles that vibrate so it exfoliates gently, like, that's all it needs to do. (cross) And I paid like, 20 bucks for it, instead of 200. It's great.


DRE: (cross) Sounds lovely.


JANINE: They have a version of it, now, that has these two metal things on the back? And you put it on your skin and it tells you how moist your skin is. 


(ALI cackles)


SYLVIA: What?


DRE: (overlapping) Hmm. Like a-- just give you like a score?


JANINE: (overlapping) It tells you, like, are you dry? Do you need more-- Yeah, it'll, it goes with the app on your phone and it will tell you, "Hey you need to moisturize here," or whatever.


KEITH: Does it-- does it tell you if you're wet or just glassy?


JANINE: It does not. I think. I think it's just testing the electric current that your skin conducts, so if it's more moist it conducts it better. They also have a thing, that is like a weird loop? And I haven't looked into it, but it waggles back and forth and I think it's supposed to tap in your undereye cream, but just, like--. I don't know, it just waggles back and forth! Also, all of these things look like sex toys. I know it, no one's saying it, but it's true.


JACK: (laughs) I mean... Have you dropped a link? Oh, yeah, here they are! I wasn't looking at Discord, I was just imagining these things.


SYLVIA: Oh, wow.


JANINE: Also, the one that checks your moisture is called the fofo? So (laughing)


DRE: Oh, these second ones you linked definitely look more like sex toys. 


JANINE: (overlapping) Uh-huh. They also have something called a Bear mini? Yeah.


SYLVIA: (overlapping) Especially when they're called "Mama mia". (DRE cackles)


JANINE: Oh, this is the Mama mia bundle, which contains the Luna fofo and the Iris, but you could also get a Bear mini.


DRE: Mm!


JANINE: Which... seems to just-- be a very expensive gua sha, which you can get pretty cheap. Because it vibrates. "Electrifying micro-current tech". 


DRE: Now I want one of these. Thanks, Janine.


JANINE: So, I'm talking a lot of shit, but my skin feels amazing? And I've had this thing for less than a week.


KEITH: Oh, there's this other one that also looks like a sex toy that's also called the Playdate, (JANINE laughs) which makes it sound like a sex toy again.


JANINE: They know what they're doing, like (AUSTIN hums agreement)


KEITH: And, but it looks like a toothbrush for your face.


JANINE: Yeah. That sounds right.


KEITH: That's funny.


JACK: I mean, but I s'pose a toothbrush is kind of a toothbrush for your face. (cross) The teeth are part of the face.


KEITH: (cross) Mm, the outside of-- the skin part of your face.


JANINE: That's true.


AUSTIN: Teeth are part of the head.


JACK: The teeth are part of-- The head is-- The head and the face are on the same-- hmm.


KEITH: The head is inside the mouth. 


AUSTIN: No.


JACK: Wh-- no.


KEITH: No?


UNIDENTIFIED: No.


(JANINE laughs)


AUSTIN: You wanna say what you said again?


KEITH: The head.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JANINE: Is inside...


KEITH: Is inside the mouth.


AUSTIN: Not--


(ALI laughs)


DRE: No.


AUSTIN: The mouth is inside the head!


JACK: The mouth is inside-- The mouth is on the head. The mouth is in the face. (laughing) And these are just signs-- and these are just


ALI: Yeah.


KEITH: Is the face on the head, or does the head stop where the face starts?


AUSTIN: I think the face is on the head.


JACK: Face is on the head, part of the head.


KEITH: Yeah.


ALI: Yeah. Your face is sitting on head.


AUSTIN: I guess the teeth are... part of the face but only when you're smiling.


JANINE: They don't disappear. 


AUSTIN: But they're not part of the face when you can't see them.


KEITH: Are the eyes part of your face if (JACK: Yes.) your eyes are closed?


JANINE: Ok, actually-- Austin, you are wrong. 


DRE: I hate this conversation (laughing)


JANINE: I can guarantee-- okay,


AUSTIN: Oh, 'cause they shape your face. You're right. Yeah, you're right.


JANINE: Because they shape your face, right? Like, when you don't have teeth, it changes the shape of your face. 


AUSTIN: Mm-hm.


KEITH: Mm, good point.


(clip 4) 10:55 


ART: When an escape pod launches, does it leave an empty hole?


KEITH: I assume that it closes, like a blast door that closes. Or something.


ART: On the outside.


KEITH: Right, yeah. Something has to seal.


(pause)


JANINE: I think a problem with answering this question is that-- do escape pods actually exist for real on anything real?


KEITH: No.


JANINE: 'Cause otherwise it's just gonna vary by fictional ship design, right?


KEITH: Right, yeah.


AUSTIN: Hello, I'm back.


KEITH: (overlapping) I think the closest thing we have


JANINE: (overlapping) Austin, are escape pods real?


AUSTIN: Are escape pods real?


JANINE: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: I dunno. They must be, right?


KEITH: No-- do, no, (stumbling) I'm not saying there's nothing with an escape pod.


JANINE: Why? Why must they be? What? 


AUSTIN: I feel like there has to be an--


ART: Like, a submarine doesn't have an escape pod?


JANINE: I don't think there's space in a submarine and also I don't think an escape pod that you would have in a submarine... To make an escape pod that would be able to endure the depths that a submarine endures and also fit all those people and stuff, that's just another submarine.


ART: Well no, because it's very small, it's only for a few people. (cross) The important thing


KEITH: (cross) And it's only to float. I think that the--


JANINE: I don't think you can get away with having an escape pod is for three people or something on a crew of like, thirty, I think that's... (cross) I think if a submarine's fucked, you're fucked.


KEITH: (cross) I think that a submarine... 


AUSTIN: (cross) Well, I was gonna say


KEITH: is just how space translates life rafts.


AUSTIN: Lifeboats. They're life rafts, right?


JACK: Yeah, but that doesn't really count, for


KEITH: No, I agree.


JACK: ...for escape pods, 'cause that's just like, hanging off the side.


AUSTIN: The other answer is yes, bombers did. Some bombers had (JANINE: Ooh.) ejection seats that would be encapsulated? 


JANINE: Okay.


AUSTIN: And some of them, apparently, literally had multiple seats ejecting in a single thing, basically. They're smaller than what we think of as an escape thing? The other thing is, and this is a rumor, a Soviet submarine class had an escape capsule that was jettisoned up when it sinks? In fact, actually, no, this one's true. The Soviet... I dunno if it's Mee-kay class or Mike class (laughs) submarine


JANINE: I don't think it's the Soviet Mike class (chuckles)


AUSTIN: The Mike class.


ART: Soviet Mike, that's my (KEITH laughing) Bluff City character


AUSTIN: (affecting a voice) That's me, hey everybody, it's me, Soviet Mike!


KEITH: (cackling) God


JANINE: This is my class. It's about how to escape a submarine. (AUSTIN laughing, cross) It's a very relevant class here.


ART: (cross) Doss vidanya [Do svidaniya but very American accent], comrade.


KEITH: I've been on Twitter long enough to know Soviet Mike, and to-- I know a lot of people that follow Soviet Mike, I don't follow Soviet Mike on Twitter.


AUSTIN: Right. But-- you know, I don't mind it so much when I see Soviet Mike get retweeted. (KEITH: Sure.) It's not-- I haven't muted Soviet Mike.


JANINE: Soviet Mike's big problem is just that Soviet Mike doesn't know when to let things go.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


JANINE: Like, really drags on the jokes a little big, after their expiration date.


AUSTIN: Yeah. (change of subject tone) Yeah, no, there's an escape capsule... on this vessel and five people used it. Wait, wow, wait. Damn. Only one of the five to reach the surface was able to leave the capsule and survive before it sank again. Nightmare. Nightmare!


JANINE: (overlapping) That's maybe why they don't do it. See, but that's what I'm saying


KEITH: (overlapping) Oh, they forgot to-- They made it float but not for long enough.


AUSTIN: Uh-huh.


JANINE: That's what I'm saying, is like... I wonder if it got crushed-- Like I wonder if the pressure fucked up the body of it so it was leaking and shit...


KEITH: Or is it just like... You float up, and you're just in the middle of the ocean in a little pod.


AUSTIN: In a little fuckin' pod, good luck!


JANINE: Yeah.


KEITH: Good luck.


ART: Speaking of horrible stories about being in small pressurized things, I heard a story this week on TikTok, where I get all of my history these days,


AUSTIN: Yeah.


ART: About a Soviet spaceship that crashed into an iced over lake?


AUSTIN: (trills lips) Pbbrtwuh.


ART: And they couldn't rescue them 'cause it was night?


AUSTIN: (groaning) Fwuuuh. Hate this.


ART: And they fished them out in the morning and just assumed they were dead, and then three hours after they fished them out in the morning they opened it to find out that they were alive?


(various groaning)


KEITH: Holy shit.


ART: But very very cold. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, I bet.


JANINE: Yeah...


AUSTIN: Bad. Bad, bad.


JANINE: The whole-- There's a lot of like, sad shit about the Soviet space program, of like... There were some Italian brothers fucking around with a radio who claimed to have overheard a bunch of transmissions, and... of Soviet astronauts who were just, burning up on re-entry (someone hisses) and swearing, and people who were like, "You left us out here, what the fuck!" All of this shit that... is for missions that are not necessarily confirmed, and there was a whole... It was a whole thing (sighs)


AUSTIN: Sounds like a whole thing.


JANINE: Their space program, you know... The mission that Yuri Gagarin died on, he volunteered for. His friend was supposed to go up, and Yuri was like, "this thing is not safe, and this dude has a family. I am not gonna let him go up on this." And sure fucking enough, it was not safe.


AUSTIN: There you go. 


KEITH: That's fucked up. I can't believe that we-- I can't believe that we went to space-- Someone should've been like, "We haven't even done computers really yet, you should..." (AUSTIN and DRE laugh) "Wait until-- Wait a little while until we're better at computers."


JACK: God. I'm back.


KEITH: Just a couple years!


(CLIP 5)16:22 


JACK: Anybody want any tips from December? (AUSTIN and JANINE chuckle) I'm in December now.


AUSTIN: What's your tip, today? Give me your December tip.


JACK: Well, this is the last month, of the year, and I think we've all done very well.


AUSTIN: Okay. Eh. 


ALI: Mm.


AUSTIN: I meant what was the quote, was what I really meant, but. 


JACK: Oh, it's by Paul Harvey. 


AUSTIN: Oh, okay, uh-huh.


JACK: And, er, he says, "Ever since I made tomorrow my favorite day, I've been uncomfortable looking back."


SYLVIA: Would've been really good if the winter tip was "Wear a warm hat."


(ALI snorts)


AUSTIN: It's a good tip.


ALI: Do that, yeah.


AUSTIN: You should wear a warm hat.


ALI: Especially if it's raining? 


SYLVIA: (agreeing) Oh my god.


JACK: Oh, especially if it's raining, yeah.


AUSTIN: Winter rain is not great.


DRE: We had "wintery mix" today.


ART: (groans) Euugh.


AUSTIN: That's the worst.


KEITH: The absolute worst kind of mix.


(AUSTIN laughs)


JANINE: I love cracking open a big bag of wintery mix, (AUSTIN laughs, cross) with like a beer, you know?


JACK: (cross) I would love Wintery Mix!


AUSTIN: Uh-huh, yeah. Alright, we should clap. 45?


ALI: Sure


AUSTIN: Do 48? 48. 48, (KEITH: Uhhh, no.) 48, 48, forty-- 50, 50 50 50 50.


DRE: 50.


(clap)


AUSTIN: I almost missed it.


JACK: (overlapping) God, Austin, you sounded like


JANINE: (overlapping) Six times!


SYLVIA: (overlapping) busy turning into an auctioneer.


(ALI giggles)


KEITH: Slightly late, maybe?


JACK: An auctioneer, or... 


AUSTIN: (mimicking auctioneer) Do I hear, forty-eight, forty-eight, forty-eight, fifty, fifty! (SYLVIA laughs)


JACK: Or like a plane's computer, that says like, (toneless) "Thirty-five, thirty-four, thirty three."


AUSTIN: (laughing) Heheyeah.


SYLVIA: God.


JACK: (in the same tone) "Pull up."


AUSTIN: "Pull up, pull up."


JANINE: (toneless) Beep beep beep beep beep.


AUSTIN: Yeah, exactly. Uhm. Alright.


(CLIP 6)17:59 


AUSTIN: Says I'm connected. But. I guess we'll see. Oh, we should do a clap.


KEITH: Oh, yeah, I love that.


AUSTIN: Love to clap.


JACK: Love to clap. It's the reason I do this job.


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Hm.


KEITH: Hey, and if it helps sync up the podcast, that's great. 


(AUSTIN chuckles)


JACK: Yeah. UH, 35?


AUSTIN: Mm-hm. 


(clap)


AUSTIN: I had a really bad latte this morning, and (cross) I'm cleansing my mouth.


KEITH: (cross) Oh. That sucks.


JACK: Too watery?


AUSTIN: No, actually. The espresso was just bad and there was too much of it.


KEITH: (overlapping) Oh, that sucks.


JACK: (overlapping) Oh, that is-- Yeah, not good.


AUSTIN: Yeah, it's, it's. Listen.


KEITH: This was a Starbucks thing?


AUSTIN: This was not a Starbucks-- This was a Dunkin's thing. (cross) Dunkin's. Dunkin's latte.


KEITH: (cross) Oh, god, they have the absolute worst espresso.


AUSTIN: I know, I took a swing. I took a swing, and I made a, it was a mistake. I had a podcast to record this morning, and I was like, I badly need... And I asked for extra, and that's the thing that's on me.


JACK: Oh, ah.


AUSTIN: 'Cause that's on me.


JACK: 'Cause now you got more bad espresso.


AUSTIN: That's exactly it. So I'm still recovering from that experience.


KEITH: I used to order... I used to get a large iced americano. And I would ask for one less shot, 'cause when we were doing RunButton, early Runbutton, and this would be my slow sip-on drink for like the whole show? And I didn't want something that would taste bad, but I also didn't want anything that I would drink too fast, so I would just drink it black and really watery. And there was a point, and I can't remember why, but I kind of just had to stop getting them at Starbucks and start getting them at Dunkin Donuts. And it was... so bad, it was like-- It was sour, and burned at the same time, (AUSTIN: Mm-hm.) and eugh, just absolute-- I mean it tasted like... It tasted like backwash of coffee. Instead of coffee.


JACK: No. Not good.


AUSTIN: Not good. Not a good one.


KEITH: Not good.


JACK: All Dunkin Donuts coffee, I feel, is bad, but the regular coffee, I feel, serves a purpose so spectacularly, that it wraps back around to being good again.


AUSTIN: That's correct. 


KEITH: To occupy Bostonians?


JACK: (chuckles) I have been--


AUSTIN: Mm. Even New Yorkers can drink-- It's not my preference. And, you know, I grew up in Jersey, so maybe in Jersey, it was like-- In Jersey, in the burbs, like Long Island, also, it's 24/7, right?


KEITH: Yeah, yeah.


AUSTIN: And, that gives it a leg up on a lot of things. Like, it's that, or if you're Long Island, it's that or 7/11? Or a diner? (cross) And that's a different experience.


KEITH: (cross) That's when-- Back when I was living in the suburbs, there wasn't a 24-hr diner around, and I was in high school or just out of high school. The 24-hr Dunkin Donuts was an easy choice for "place to hang out until 3 in the morning"?


AUSTIN: Yes. Sure. Totally.


JACK: Mm.


KEITH: Just like, me and three friends at a table goofing off. So. That's the best thing Dunkin's ever did, and then second best thing is a breakfast sandwich? Love a breakfast sandwich.


AUSTIN: Their best is Dunkaccino so that we can get the Al Pacino memes.


(KEITH laughs)


JACK: Mm. I like that Twitter account.


AUSTIN: 'S good.


KEITH: I don't even know this account.


AUSTIN: Do you know the original performance?


KEITH: Of... Al Pacino (cross) doing a Dunkaccino thing?


AUSTIN: (cross) Okay, we're gonna watch this live, huh.


JACK: Ookay. Right. Uh-huh.


AUSTIN: I'm gonna give you a link, and then we're gonna count ourselves in, and then we're gonna get a copyright strike. I guess the thing we're learning here is that Keith has not watched "Jack and Jill" from 2011.


KEITH: (sadly) No, I haven't.


JACK: I also have not watched "Jack and Ji--" Is that the Adam Sandler movie that's probably transphobic?


AUSTIN: (cross) Yeah, that's the Adam Sandler movie. Oh, that sounds likely. This is not, though.


JACK: Where you putting this link, Austin?


AUSTIN: I'm gonna drop this right in the same chat that we have in Discord.


JACK: Oh, Keith, this is so painful. (cross) You're about to experience a horror.


AUSTIN: (cross) Let me know when you're ready to count in, there might be an advertisement up first that we have to count through.


KEITH: Uh. I have no-- I don't do-- I don't have ads on Youtube.


AUSTIN: I don't do ads, you don't do ads, I see.


KEITH: Yep. I pay for Youtube Music? (AUSTIN: Wink.) Instead of Spotify, so I don't have. Ads.


AUSTIN: We ready to do a count?


JACK: Uh. Count us in, Austin.


AUSTIN: Three, two, one. 


DUNKACCINO NARRATOR: Something's brewing at D&D!


AUSTIN: Go-- That was a. Sorry.


KEITH: Implied go, I got it.


PERSON AT DUNKIN: Wow!


OTHER PERSON AT DUNKIN: Al Pacino!


AUSTIN: Production count.


AL PACINO: It's not Al anymore! It's Dunk!


DUNKIN EMPLOYEE: Dunk-accino?


AL PACINO: Don't mind if I DO!


(record scratching music)


AL PACINO: What's my name?


DUNKIN PEOPLE: Dunkaccino!


AL PACINO: It's a whole new game!


DUNKIN PEOPLE: Dunkaccino!


KEITH: Oh no.


AL PACINO: You want creamy goodness? I'm your friend. Say hello to my chocolate blend! (AUSTIN laughs) Attica, hoo-wah, latte lite. This whole trial is out of sight.


KEITH: Oh, god.


JACK: It's gonna get worse.


AL PACINO: They pulled me back in with hazelnut too! Caramel swirl-- I know it was you. Everyone wants my Dunkaccino. Can't get enough of my Dunkaccino.


AUSTIN: Why did he decide to do this?


AL PACINO: Kids from seven to seventeen-o. Lining up for my Dunkaccino.


KEITH: They thought--


AL PACINO AND OTHERS: What's my name? Dunkaccino! A-dunka-dunka-dunka-dunka-dunkaccino!


KEITH: They had the idea for Dunkaccino, right? And then just were not competent enough to do something better.


ADAM SANDLER IN JACK AND JILL: And boom, there you have it, it's actually 32 seconds, so I gotta lose 2 seconds


AUSTIN: I'm not gonna watch the rest of this scene, I don't wanna see Adam Sandler's face.


KEITH: Okay.


AUSTIN: Uhm. But.


KEITH: "I don't wanna see that guy's FACE!"


AUSTIN: I'm done with that guy. That guy, get outta here. The thing that kills me, is, it would not be... He says, what's he say? He says, "It's not Al anymore, it's Dunk!"


KEITH: "It's Dunk."


JACK: "It's Dunk." But it would be...


AUSTIN: And then he says, "Dunkaccino?" But it would be "Dunk Pacino". (KEITH and AUSTIN laugh) Like it's not even


KEITH: He changed both names.


AUSTIN: He did.


JACK: There is a twitter account called "Daily Dunkaccino" (AUSTIN: Right.) that reinterprets this video every day, and I haven't been able to watch any of the recent ones to confirm they're good, except this one, which is called "Dunkaccino but when someone recognizes Al the commercial ends?" (KEITH cackles) If you'd just like to hit play on that one, Austin?


DUNKACCINO: Wow! (video loops) Something's brewing at D&D.


AUSTIN: (laughs) That's good. 


DUNKACCINO: Wow! (video loops) Something's brewing at D&D.


AUSTIN: That's a perfect video. (KEITH cackling) As you can see, there are tons of these, even going for at least a few months now.


KEITH: Wow. I've never even-- I've never seen a single one of these (cross) come across my timeline.


AUSTIN: (cross) There's a bunch. There's a bunch, if you wanted to see one...


KEITH: Daily Dunkaccino.


AUSTIN: that is like, uh... I'm just scrolling now. You know, I think this one's a Blade Runner 2049 one? That's 3 minutes long, that seems like too much.


KEITH: That seems a little long.


AUSTIN: "Dunkaccino but it's an any% speedrun" is good.


JACK: (laughs) Oh, that one's really good.


DUNKACCINO: It's not Al anymore! It's DUNK! Dunkaccino? Don't mind if I do!


KEITH: Any% speedrun.


AUSTIN: Happy AGDQ everybody.


DUNKACCINO: What's my na--(loud beep)


AUSTIN: There's a glitch.


JACK: Yeah, happy AGDQ!


AUSTIN: Oh! Oh, oh, okay, waitwaitwait, here's one we gotta, I gotta get you this one, Keith. This is the one I need your immediate true response to. Gimme a, lemme know when you're ready to go. Gimme a count in. (cross) I'll give you a count in.


KEITH: (cross) Oh, great, recognizing it already. Alright. (simultaneously) Three.


AUSTIN: (simultaneously) Three. 


KEITH: Okay, you go.


AUSTIN: Three, two, one, go.


DUNKACCINO: (Sonic Adventure Station Square music playing) Something's brewing at D&D.


(AUSTIN and KEITH giggling)


DUNKACCINO: Wow! Al Pacino? It's not Al anymore, it's Dunk!


KEITH: Ah, this song speaks to my heart.


AUSTIN: It's so good.


DUNKACCINO: Dunkaccino? Don't mind if I do! (music changes to regular rap section) What's my name? Dunkaccino!


AUSTIN: Did they get rid of it? That's a shame. They should keep it through the whole video. (cross) In my opinion.


KEITH: (cross) Yeah, they should.


AUSTIN: Oh wait, is there more-- wait.


KEITH: Just change the-- just pitch shift it. Oh, is there more?


AUSTIN: Wait, keep it going. I was wrong to click away.


KEITH: OH (laughs)


AUSTIN: I should have trusted the video.


KEITH: Oh no, Chaos is going to kill them while they're-- kind of rapping.


AUSTIN: For people who are listening and cannot see this, it is "Dunkaccino but it's Station Square," which is of course a location in Sonic Adventure.


DUNKACCINO: (muffled as if heard underwater) Dunkaccino! adunkadunkadunkadunka Dunkaccino! (sound of glass breaking)


(AUSTIN chuckles)


(KEITH cackling)


AUSTIN: The slow pan at the end! Good account. Shout outs to Daily Dunkaccino.


KEITH: Ah. I like the implication that the Dunkaccino song has caused this.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm.


JACK: Yes. It is on some level their fault.


AUSTIN: Things were fine when it was just the Station Square music.


KEITH: yeah.


JACK: Uh-huh. Yeah.


AUSTIN: Alright. We should do a podcast.


KEITH: Great song. What a great--


AUSTIN: Mm-hm. That whole soundtrack is great. Um. "Heads up. We've detected copyrighted audio and video on your stream. Your stream may be temporarily blocked." (JACK laughs) So we'll see.


KEITH: Really? They do that for livestreams now?


AUSTIN: Apparently they do that for livestreams now.


KEITH: Holy shit.


AUSTIN: (cross) They'll let us know.


JACK: (cross) Can everybody hear us.


KEITH: They saw the Twitch thing, and were like, "We can do better."


AUSTIN: I asked the chat if we have been temporarily blocked. Do you think it was the movie "Click", sorry not "Click". "Jack and Jill"? (cross) Or do you think it was... 


KEITH: (cross) It's always music. Is my understanding.


AUSTIN: Station Square.


JACK: Okay, we're apparently-- People can still hear us, apparently.


AUSTIN: That's good, that's good. That was-- that was all editorializing. I feel like that was all protected under fair use.


KEITH: Yeah of course it was. I mean it all fucking is.


AUSTIN: I know. Anyway. (JACK laughs) Let's do an intro.


JACK: Your Honor.


AUSTIN: "It all fucking is, Your Honor!"


KEITH: It all fuckin' is, Your Honor!
