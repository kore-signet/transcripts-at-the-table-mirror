Clapcast 69: That's a Hot One
Transcriber: robotchangeling


Ali: Yeah, I don't hear anything.


Janine: I don't hear anything.


Dre: I don't hear a noise. I am just making the noise.


Austin: You're not hearing–


Janine: What are we reacting to?


Ali: Yeah.


Austin: You're not hearing that? Okay.


Dre: I see it. I see it moving.


Austin: You see it?


Ali: Wait, see what?


Janine: See what? What’s moving? 


Dre: The Marn super reaction? Is that what we’re talking about?


Austin: Oh, no, no, no, no. Not that.


Dre: Oh.


Austin: There’s a new, other thing–


Dre: There’s a new other thing.


Austin: That they’re telling me that I have access to, which is a soundboard.


Dre: Oh.


Ali: Oh.


Austin: Which shouldn’t…they shouldn’t…


Ali: They shouldn’t let you do that.


Austin: No.


Janine: That’s so annoying to me.


[duck quack sound effect]


Ali: Oh!


Janine: Oh!


Austin: Yeah, I heard it. I heard the quack.


Janine: Quack.


Ali: Wait. 


[air horn sound effect] 


Ali: Oh.


Austin: I can’t– 


Sylvia: Eh…


Austin: Yeah. No, this can't happen.


Dre: That’s bad. Listen.


Janine: This is bad, because like, I understand it for like when you're streaming, but when you're like talking with friends, being the soundboard person [Dre: “Mm-hmm,” Austin: “Yeah, uh huh”] who’s doing a soundboard in your conversation with your friends?


Austin: Yeah.


Janine: Ew.


Dre: Now, okay, hold on. 


[applause sound effect]


Austin: No. No. [Janine and Ali laugh]


Ali: Sorry, it’s funny.


Sylvia: It’s fucking…it’s…


Austin: It’s not.


Sylvia: They’re MSN nudges.


Dre: I worked so hard to get a stream deck in order to be an annoying soundboard person.


Austin: Right, uh huh. And now…


Ali: Mm.


Dre: And now just anybody can do it.


Austin: And now anybody can do it. True.


Janine: Mm-hmm.


Ali: I like that servers can have their own sounds, though. I wonder if I'm going to get a bunch of cool Animal Crossing sounds from still being in that server.


Austin: Oh, sure.


Ali: So, you know, some benefits.


Dre: Oh, hold on.


Janine: They’re still keeping that up?


Ali: Um, I stay in there for the emotes, really.


Janine: Mm.


Austin: Yeah, that makes sense.


Dre: Sure.


Sylvia: I have a lot of Discords like that, honestly. [Ali laughs]


Dre: Yeah.


Sylvia: I'm not even fucking lying. Like, that’s just straight up true. I'm like, I don’t talk to anybody in here anymore. 


Austin: Just here for the…


Janine: Oh, I don't have Nitro. I was going to use the drum, the “ba dum tsh”. 


Ali: Oh. Aww.


Austin: I have Nitro, and it doesn’t play. I'm hitting the button, and nothing is happening, [drum beat sound effect] so it’s bugged for me. I hate…


Janine: Mm.


Sylvia: Oh, I don't know if I have this new feature or whatever, but I'm abstaining.


Austin: I appreciate it.


Sylvia: A conscientious objector.


Austin: Oh.


Janine: I like the degree of this that’s like Zoom, where Zoom has like reactions where it’ll like put the emoji on your camera thing, [“Mm-hmm”] because it knows that most people aren’t looking at the chat.


Austin: Right.


Janine: And that’s nice. I like that, but I don't want audio. 


Austin: Yeah.


Janine: I don't need audio in that equation.


Austin: No.


Dre: Oh, they can only be five seconds. That’s good.


Ali: Oh, god. [laughs] 


Sylvia: [horrified whisper] Five seconds?


Janine: “Hit hold control plus mark to use soundboard in a game overlay.” What? 


Dre: How else are you going to tell people that you did it poggers? [someone makes displeased sound]


Janine: In a game overlay. Does that mean like into Apex or whatever? Make the quack sound in your Apex?


Austin: Oh, I hope not. If someone starts making quack sounds while I'm playing games… [Ali snorts] I mean, this is why I don't play games anymore. This is why– you know what? I don't play games, as a person.


Ali: Wow, you don't play games anymore.


Dre: Only Anthem.


Austin: I don't play games anymore. All business.


Ali: Wow.


Dre: Only Anthem, and nobody’s around to make noises in there.


Janine: Anthem’s not a game. It’s a way of life.


Sylvia: It’s a business.


Austin: That’s right. I uninstalled Anthem, is an important note to everybody.


Dre: Okay.


Austin: My Anthem honeymoon is over. I hit the point of the game where it’s just the most boring thing they’ve ever made—anyone’s ever made, honestly—and so it’s uninstalled.


Sylvia: Mm-hmm.


Austin: But I did put another 20 hours into it, for anyone who’s curious.


Sylvia: Oh. What’s that rounded out to? Just 20 total, or…?


Austin: No, it’s like 50. It’s like 50?


Sylvia: Okay, cool. Cool, cool, cool.


Dre: [whispering] Austin.


Austin: Ever.


Janine: I can't decide which parts of these statements are supposed to lend you cred and which ones are supposed to take the cred away.


Austin: I'm no cred. I don't play games. I don't have cred. I'm done with it all.


Dre: Sure.


Janine: No gamer cred.


Austin: No gamer cred.


Sylvia: Quote that shit. “I don't play games. I don't have cred.”


Janine: Zero gamer credit score.


Dre: You ask Austin, “Hey, you got games on that phone?” Austin says, “Fuck no.”


Austin: Also, it’s not 50. [laughs] It’s 44. I have 44 hours, but I came in with like 25, so, you know. It’s depressing. Anyway.


Dre: Anyway.


Austin: Yeah, yeah.


[Dre’s soundboard plays Burger King song: “Whopper, whopper, whopper, whopper.”]


Sylvia: [wearily] No.


Ali: No. [laughs quietly] 


Janine: Discord would take that money.


Austin: They would. They would take that money. They’re not above it.


Janine: No. They’ve proven that.


Austin: It’s true. It’s true.


[transition 0:04:09]


Jack: Yep. It took its sweet time.


Dre: Now, Jack…


Jack: Dre.


Dre: What are we counting as warm and what are we counting as not warm?


Jack: Warm is when you go outside and the sun on your skin feels good.


Dre: Okay. Gotcha.


Jack: I am wearing–


Dre: So when the Sheryl Crow song starts to play. That’s when it’s warm.


Ali: Mm.


Jack: When the Sheryl Crow song starts to play, but maybe not when the Santana song starts to play.


Dre: Mm. Sure.


Jack: That might be a bit much.


Dre: Well, that’s a hot one.


Ali: Yeah, that’s not warm.


Jack: That’s a hot one, yeah. Whereas, right now, there’s a breeze in the air. I went out and I planted some tomatoes earlier.


Dre: Ohoho!


Jack: You know? [laughs] That’s how you know it’s good, if you're planting tomatoes.


Ali: Mm.


Dre: I don't know when I'm going to feel safe to plant tomatoes this season.


Austin: Hello.


Jack: Oh, really, because of the weather? Damn.


Dre: Pshh. Yeah.


Jack: Do you think you're out of the frost range?


Dre: Uh, I could not tell you. 


Ali: [laughs] Oh no!


Dre: Let me look at what the weather was this week. I was telling Austin, we had 80 mile per hour winds earlier this week.


Ali: Oh shit.


Jack: Jesus Christ. Yeah.


Austin: That’s a lot. That’s a lot.


Dre: Very briefly, but we had a tornado touch down.


Jack: My word.


Dre: It won’t let me look at what the weather was earlier in the week, just what it’s going to be later.


Austin: Mm.


Ali: Ooh.


Dre: But I definitely remember it being like close to frost point, if not below, and right now it’s like 65, so. [laughs] 


Jack: Okay. Yeah, strange.


Austin: Yeah.


Jack: Strange weather.


Austin: Yeah.


Dre: This is what we do.


Austin: Yeah, it was like cold cold last week, and then it was like 73 the other day, so I'm like…I don’t know.


Ali: I know, and it’s like cold cold now.


Austin: Yeah, uh huh.


Jack: Oh, has it gotten cold again in New York?


Ali: Mm-hmm.


Austin: It’s just like every day has gone back and forth this week.


Ali: Yeah. I was in Coney Island today, because I had to go to the DMV.


Jack: Oh, yeah?


Ali: So of course I got a Nathan’s hot dog.


Austin: Ooh, is that where you have to go? All the way out there?


Ali: Huh?


Austin: That’s where the DMV is in Brooklyn?


Ali: Well, there’s one at like Atlantic Terminal, and…


Austin: Okay. It’s just down there.


Ali: The Coney Island one isn’t super busy, so.


Austin: Okay, sure.


Ali: Yeah, and also I'm very south Brooklyn.


Austin: Yeah.


Ali: But it was like–


Austin: But Coney Island is just so far out! 


Ali: [laughs] It’s not that far. It’s like a 20 minute drive is really what it is.


Austin: Okay. I guess that’s fair. Yeah.


Ali: Or like a– because I can take the R to the N.


Austin: Right, right, right, right. That makes sense.


Ali: Anyway. So, it was like windy chilly and looking like it was about to rain.


Austin: Right. Yeah.


Ali: And, for some reason, there was like a ton of tourists there?


Jack: Huh.


Austin: Weird.


Ali: I guess they were just like, “It’s April in New York, so let’s go.”


Dre: Mm. Let’s do it.


Ali: And witnessing all of them have sort of a bad day [Ali laughs, Jack: “Oh no!” Austin: “Yeah,” Dre: “Aww”] while I was trying to get my hot dog was satisfying to me.


Austin: That’s brutal.


Dre: Oh, hell yeah. Okay, good.


Ali: There was like a ton of tourists and a couple of weird guys, [Austin: “Coney Island, baby!”] so I was glad that they were like getting the experience.


Austin: Yeah, that is the experience.


Jack: Yeah.


Austin: Coney Island is 90 minutes from me by train and bus.


Ali: Oh, wow.


Austin: If I just did train– okay, if I just did train, it would still be at 90 minutes but with a 22 minute walk, so.


Jack: Whoof.


Austin: Oh, where’s that walk at? Oh, it’s–


Ali: Wouldn’t you– you can’t just take the N straight down, and that would be like…?


Austin: I can, but I'm now a 20 minute walk away from the N is the thing.


Ali: Oh. 


Austin: Right? So.


Ali: Sure, sure, sure, sure.


Austin: And so, yeah, that’s a straight shot, but that’s still a while.


Ali: That’s…yeah.


Austin: You know?


Ali: I've done it.


Austin: Mm-hmm.


Jack: Last time I was in Coney Island, I was there with you, Ali.


Ali: Mm-hmm.


Jack: And we saw some birds fighting each other.


Dre: Ooh.


Ali: Yeah.


Austin: That sounds like Coney Island.


Ali: Yeah.


Austin: If you're in Coney Island, and you don't see at least one fight of some sort… [Ali laughs]


Jack: Of some creature. Human, animal, just nature. Yeah.


Austin: All right.


Ali: Time.is.


Austin: Time.is. 


Jack: Time.is.


Austin: Happy Good Friday. Happy World Health Day. Happy International Beaver Day.


Ali: Wow.


Dre: Oh! Okay, one of those is very good.


Ali: Oh, I had a hot dog on Good Friday! 


Austin: Oh, you fucked up.


Jack: Oh. 


Ali: I'm sorry, God. [laughs] 


Dre: Good Hot Dog Friday.


Austin: You fucked up.


Ali: I'm sorry.


Jack: Wait, why is that a fuckup?


Austin: Oh.


Jack: Are you not supposed to…?


Ali: Because you can't eat meat.


Dre: Well…


Austin: Catholics, you know?


Dre: Oh.


Jack: Oh, on Good Friday you can't eat meat?


Austin: Y'all don’t– yeah. On Fridays in Lent you can’t eat meat.


Dre: Yeah. 


Jack: Can you eat fish?


Dre: Except for fish. Fish, yeah.


Austin: Except for fish, yeah.


Dre: That’s where the fish fry cultural phenomenon…


Jack: You were by the water, and you chose a hot dog, a creature of the land. A sinful creature of the land. [Ali laughs]


Dre: You could have had a fish dog.


Ali: I could’ve got some fish and chips from Nathan’s, man.


Austin: Fish and chips or something? Yeah, you could have.


Ali: They sell clams.


Austin: They sell clams there?


Ali: I wouldn’t have a Nathan’s clam, but… [laughs] 


Austin: Do they sell clams, or do they sell like fried clams? They must sell fried clams.


Dre: What, like clam strips?


Austin: Yeah, like–


Ali: The sign has the shell on it, so I don't know what to tell you.


Austin: Really?


Dre: Oouh. [Ali laughs]


Austin: I bet it’s clam strips.


Jack: I don't think you could sell…I think you have to put the shell on, because if you accurately represent in a picture what clam looks like, nobody would buy it.


Ali: Mm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. That’s fair.


Jack: The shell is there to talk you into it.


Austin: Wow, they sell– this is– so, you were at Nathan’s Famous. You were at THE Nathan’s, right?


Ali: Yeah. THE Nathan’s.


Austin: On Surf Ave.


Ali: Yeah.


Austin: Okay, there is a takeout counter called Nathan’s Clam Bar that serves raw clams and oysters.


Dre: Ooh.


Jack: Holy shit!


Austin: “There usually isn’t much of a line here, so if you'd rather not wait for a hot dog, just grab a little cardboard tray of shellfish.” [Ali laughs]


Dre: I mean, I'll fuck up some raw oysters.


Austin: Clams and oysters aren’t shellfish, are they? I guess they are.


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: They are?


Jack: Super are, Austin.


Ali: They’re inside of a shell.


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: Okay. Sorry. I think of shellfish as being like…


Ali: Shrimp.


Dre: Lobsters.


Austin: Crabs and lobsters and shrimp.


Ali: Crabs and…yeah.


Dre: Yeah.


Jack: Oh, I see, right.


Austin: I think of clams as being like mollusks.


Ali: Oh, you know where we should go?


Austin: Yeah, what’s up?


Ali: We should go to that, um…the New Orleans place by you and get some gumbo.


Austin: Oh, yeah, we should go there right now.


Ali: [laughs] Sorry, everybody.


Jack: [laughs] Screw this!


Austin: Sugar Freak. We should go to Sugar Freak.


Jack: Oh, Sugar Freak is great.


Austin: Jack, we’ve never taken you to Sugar Freak. Have we taken you to Sugar Freak?


Jack: No, I think I've been.


Austin: Okay, good.


Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah.


Austin: Good, good, good.


Jack: Yeah, absolutely. I think. Let me look it up.


Austin: Yeah, we should go. It’s great.


Jack: Ooh.


Ali: Dre, you can come here. We can take you to restaurants.


Austin: Please, Dre, come up.


Dre: Okay.


Austin: We gotta have a [unclear]


Ali: Dre, we’ll go to Kentucky and insist you make us a pot roast. [laughs] 


Dre: Sure.


Austin: That sounds good too.


Dre: Wait, why a pot roast?


Ali: [laughs] I was–


Dre: Why is that the…?


Austin: Is that what your Kentucky reach was?


Ali: I think I meant to say like brisket or something, but pot roast came to… [laughs] 


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: Brisket.


Jack: No, listen. We can go to Dre.


Dre: That famous barbecue dish, pot roast. [Ali laughs harder]


Jack: And they’re going to cook up a pot roast.


Austin: Kentucky pot roast. Okay, there’s apparently a Mississippi pot roast.


Ali: Okay! [laughs] 


Austin: “Why is Mississippi pot roast so good?”


Ali: Mm.


Austin: That’s a great question.


Jack: Well, I mean, I'll say this.


Dre: I'll make you some burgoo.


Jack: Oh.


Austin: What’s burgoo?


Dre: It’s a stew.


Austin: Oh, I see it now.


Jack: A pot roast is good. A stew is one of the good things that humans discovered.


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Jack: I clicked onto Google Street View on Coney Island, and I found a deeply cursed Street View camera, [laughs] for not the reason you're expecting. Like, pan around. 


Dre: Okay.


Jack: Don't switch to a different one.


Austin: Okay. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not right. Incorrect way.


Jack: Something has gone wrong here.


Austin: Something’s gone wrong! 


Ali: Now, wait a minute.


Austin: What’s the axis here?


Dre: Oh. Yeah, this is–


Jack: We are on some sort of misaligned axis.


Dre: Okay, hold on.


Austin: Yeah, someone fucked– someone just hit this with a baseball bat.


Jack: Yeah.


Austin: And it was like, snap! Take a picture anyway!


Ali: Oh, I see what you mean.


Jack: It’s not great.


Dre: Oh. 


Jack: Oh, look, there’s some sort of…


Dre: It’s weird to see the Google man in this picture.


Jack: Wait.


Austin: Oh, like straight down?


Jack: Oh, yeah!


Dre: Yeah, if you go straight down.


Austin: Holding the thing? Yeah.


Dre: And also, the only person whose face is blurred is the Google person.


Austin: Uh huh.


Dre: That’s…


Austin: That’s fucked up. Yeah. [Ali laughs]


Jack: Wow. I like the Bluff City chromatic aberration that is going on with the ferris wheel.


Ali: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: Ferris. One second. I have to– oh, I see it. I see it. Oh, yeah, that’s cool.


Dre: So, in this Google Street View, where’s the guy who talks about kissing Joe Biren?


Austin: He is back– do you see– okay.


Dre: Because I assume he’s just there all the time.


Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, do you see where Nathan’s is? [Ali laughs]


Dre: Uh huh. Yeah.


Austin: Just keep going that way, [Dre: “Okay”] down the boardwalk, off the boardwalk, and into the streets.


Dre: Oh, okay.


Austin: And you’ll find him.


Dre: Gotcha. That’s also where the Ariana Grande guy is.


Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh huh.


Dre: Okay.


Austin: Yes.


Jack: That’s a cute exterior to that Nathan’s place. I like that yellow and red and the like…it’s a striking building.


Austin: The original.


Jack: Yeah.


Austin: Been in New York since 1916.


Jack: It’s got some hot dogs on the top.


Dre: Oh.


Austin: 100 years. Yeah.


Jack: The hot dog is wearing a chef’s hat and apron. Deeply unsettling.


Dre: Now, what can you get from Ruby’s Bar and Grill?


Austin: What can't you get from Ruby’s Bar and Grill, Dre?


Dre: I don't know.


Austin: Well, you know, it says here, “ice cream.” It says here, “Come in and,” something.


Dre: “See.”


Austin: Funnel cake. I see funnel cakes. I see gyros. I see fries. I see clams.


Ali: Wow.


Dre: Okay. All right.


Austin: So, probably a similar vibe, you know?


Dre: Sure.


Austin: I'm surprised no one’s asked: what can you get from the Brooklyn Beach Shop? [Ali laughs]


Dre: Looks like bad t-shirts.


Jack: What could you get from the…


Austin: A terrifying face on it. I hate this.


Dre: Yeah, that face is bad.


Austin: Face is bad.


Jack: Where’s it to? I don't see it. Is it…?


Austin: Uh, keep going past the Nathan’s. Like, on the Nathan’s side.


Jack: Oh, I see. Past the Ruby’s.


Austin: Past the Ruby’s.


Dre: Oh, wow! Tom’s Coney Island has seating.


Ali: Ooh.


Austin: The little evil face on the amusement part zone?


Jack: Yes.


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: Is like, this is from Batman.


Dre: 100%, yeah.


Austin: This is like Gotham City shit.


Jack: It really, it fully is from…so, when Ali and I went, it was nowhere near this busy. I don't know what month it was, but like…


Austin: I've never seen Coney Island this busy, but I think that that reflects, yeah, I don't ever go during the busy months, I guess.


Ali: Mm-hmm. 


Jack: And it felt very Batman.


Dre: [laughs suddenly] Sorry. 


Austin: Dre?


Dre: Uh, I found one more blurred face.


Austin: Oh, okay.


Dre: Uh…


Austin: I'm excited. [Jack and Ali laugh] Oh my god. Oh my god. 


Jack: This is the blurred face of an Elsa cosplayer.


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: Uh huh.


Jack: From Frozen. And because she’s wearing some sort of full mask– she’s not like a face character, she’s wearing like a full mask.


Dre: Yeah.


Jack: The blurred face is huge.


Dre: Uh huh.


Jack: She looks upsetting.


Austin: You're leaving out a detail.


Dre: And then Olaf just chilling right next to her.


Austin: Yeah. And then Olaf is there.


Dre: The worst Olaf costume I've ever seen! [Dre and Ali laugh]


Austin: And utterly unblurred. Like, insistently unblurred.


Dre: Ohh, the Olaf costume looks like they just took like a Mr. Peanut and just spraypainted it white. [Jack laughs]


Austin: Uh huh. Uh huh.


Ali: Mm.


Jack: You know that that Olaf guy came up to the camera person afterwards and said, “Don't blur me.” [Ali laughs]


Austin: Yeah.


Jack: “I want to be seen.”


Dre: “Show me. Show me.”


Austin: “I want to be– oh, y'all on Google? Yeah, put me– I'm trying to get famous. Put me on Google.”


Jack: [laughs] As a snowman.


Austin: Great name of another restaurant here. Uh, how do I link y'all? Let me share. 


Dre: I'm actually– so…


Austin: Link to share. Here we go. Great. Incredible. Did that not work? Oh, it does.


Ali: Wow.


Dre: I guess I always knew that like Coney Island was like a beach?


Jack: Whoa!


Dre: But I'm shocked by the number of like swimsuit people I'm seeing.


Austin: People are out here trying to have a good time.


Ali: Oh, yeah. Yeah, it’s a beach.


Dre: No, I know.


Ali: You're going to the beach.


Dre: I'm not hating.


Austin: Yeah.


Dre: I just didn’t– I never like put that together in my mind.


Austin: Yeah.


Ali: I want a sausage from this place.


Jack: Austin, why is this place named like a 2016 YA novel?


Austin: Paul’s Daughter. This fall.


Jack: The Hangman’s Daughter.


Austin: Yeah, uh huh. [Austin and Jack laugh]


Ali: I want some ice cream from…


Austin: Yeah.


Dre: Yeah.


Jack: I would eat anything, eat and drink anything featured on the front here.


Austin: Oh, I fucked up. [Ali laughs quietly]


Jack: They are offering fries–


Austin: I'm on the wrong– I can’t get back to the boardwalk. I'm like on the wrong side of the boardwalk.


Dre: Uh oh.


Austin: They changed lanes on me. [Ali laughs]


Jack: Uh oh!


Austin: I can't get back to Paul’s Daughter. It’s taking me…


Jack: Help him! Somebody help him! [Ali and Dre laugh]


Austin: Help me! Bring me back! Yeah, this place looks great.


Jack: Wait, this place also has cotton candy [Austin: “Yeah”] in the colors of the trans pride flag.


Austin: Oh!


Jack: Paul’s Daughter.


Austin: Shoutouts to Paul’s Daughter. Shoutouts to Paul’s Daughter. Where’s that at? I don't see that.


Jack: On the far right hand side.


Dre: Oh, I see it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 


Austin: Oh, I see that. Yeah. That feels coincidental to me.


Ali: Yeah.


Dre: Yeah, I think it is, but…


Jack: Oh, yeah, but look, you take W’s where you can get them.


Ali: Uh huh.


Austin: Yeah, 100%.


Dre: Yeah, no, for sure.


Jack: And sometimes it’s at the Paul’s Daughter. [laughs] 


Dre: If you look on the…you can only get like a closeup view on like the signs that are on the far left pillar.


Austin: Mm-hmm.


Dre: And one of them is “Pizza Pie: Hey! Get it! Get it!” [Ali and Jack laugh]


Ali: If you say so, buddy!


Jack: Sure. Okay.


Austin: “Paul’s Daughter is one of the oldest spots on the boardwalk, currently operated by the original owner’s daughter, Tina. They serve up clams on the half shell, lobster rolls, hot dogs, and cold beer.”


Jack: Wait, it’s being run by the daughter now? Sick!


Dre: That’s awesome.


Austin: Well, it’s being run by…I don't know if it’s Paul’s daughter, but it’s certainly being run by a daughter. We don't– the name of the original founder is not listed.


Jack: That’s true.


Ali: Oh.


Jack: We have to assume it’s Paul. Oh, I see. Oh, I understand. I see what you're getting at, yeah.


Austin: You see what I'm saying? We don't know that it’s Paul.


Jack: No, no.


Austin: The original owner could be Paul’s daughter. This could be Paul’s granddaughter.


Dre: Mm.


Ali: Wait, Google’s really scaring me right now.


Austin: Uh oh.


Dre: Uh oh.


Ali: Because I have– [laughs] I'm standing on the beach, and I keep trying to click forward to get closer to the shore, but it doesn’t…


Austin: It’s not going.


Ali: It doesn’t go. 


Jack: You're stuck.


Austin: Uh huh. That’s Blough City right there.


Ali: It’s just like this internal reload into the same place.


Austin: Uh huh. That’s how they get you.


Ali: I'm scared.


Austin: Close the tab, if you can. [Jack laughs] 


Ali: I can’t close it.


Austin: If you dare. [Ali laughs]


Jack: Close the tab, if you dare.


Dre: I'm sad that I can't Google Street View my way into the theme park over here.


Austin: [sighs] Yeah.


Ali: Oh.


Jack: It’s bullshit that you can’t do that, frankly. You should be able to Google Street View your way onto a ride, and then everything has motion blur. [all laugh] The camera can't keep up.


Austin: I feel like that’s somewhere. I bet that there’s like a Six Flags or a Knott’s Berry Farm. You know what I mean? 


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: Like, some smaller amusement park has let that happen, for sure.


Jack: Oh, I'm going to send you a pleasant thing. If you click this, you’ll be looking at the beach, but if you turn around and look behind you, you’ll see this big nice empty vacant lot covered in like green plants.


Austin: Mm.


Ali: Oh, sure.


Jack: Look at that.


Austin: Yeah. Love it.


Dre: I have great news.


Austin: Yes.


Dre: You can Google Street View your way through Holiday World & Splashin’ Safari in Santa Claus, Indiana.


Austin: See, this is…


Ali: Oh.


Jack: That’s great news. [Ali laughs quietly] 


Austin: In Santa Claus, Indiana.


Dre: Yeah, man!


Austin: You love to hear it.


Dre: That’s where I rode my first roller coaster.


Austin: Hell yeah.


Ali: Hell yeah.


Jack: What roller coaster was it?


Dre: The Raven.


Austin: The Raven.


Jack: The Raven.


Austin: Quoth the raven.


Jack: Quoth the raven.


Dre: It’s like an old timey wooden roller coaster.


Austin: What was the name of this place?


Dre: Holiday World.


Austin: Holiday World.


Ali: Ooh.


Jack: They’re all Edgar Allen Poe themed.


Dre: It’s like an hour and a half north of Louisville? Maybe not even. Whenever…their like big thing now is that like if you pay for admission you get free sunscreen and free drinks all day.


Austin: Oh, sure. 


Ali: [laughs] Nice!


Jack: Oh, that’s cool, honestly.


Dre: No, it’s nice, yeah.


Austin: Yeah. No, I'm…yeah.


Jack: Oh. I accidentally walked into a building containing a carousel, and I can't get out.


Dre: Uh oh.


Austin: I found the Raven.


Dre: Mm-hmm. It’s like right there.


Austin: Yeah. The Raven.


Dre: Yeah, no, Holiday World is great.


Austin: Ca-caw!


Jack: That’s what the raven quoth is in the poem, right, Austin? “Ca-caw”?


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: He goes, “Ca-caw!” Yeah. That’s why he’s so annoying.


Jack: He’s so annoying, and he gave Edgar a real headache.


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: Yeah. “Get out of here,” said Edgar to the bird, and the bird said, “Ca-caw!” I believe the poem goes.


Jack: “Ca-caw!” quoth the raven. [laughs] 


Dre: Will they let me Street View into the…? Because the water park is where like the real good stuff is.


Austin: Mm.


Dre: I mean, it’s not like– it’s not Action Park, but…


Austin: I mean, but what is?


Dre: Yeah. I feel like I felt like I almost died a few times in the Holiday World water park. [Ali and Dre laugh] 


Jack: Is Action Park the one with that slide that kills you?


Dre: Yes.


Jack: Yes. Okay.


Dre: Yes.


Austin: Uh, Action Park does not exist anymore. It’s finally…


Ali: Oh, really?


Jack: Oh, really?


Austin: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It closed in the ‘90s, and then it got reopened, and it closed again like six years ago.


Dre: God, where’s this…?


Jack: Oh, I must be thinking of another fearsome slide.


Austin: Are you thinking of the big slide from Detroit?


Jack: I am thinking of the big slide from Detroit where you get air after a couple of–


Austin: Yeah, no. The thing about Action Park is that six people died there over the course of a decade or seven years.


Ali: Oh.


Jack: Jesus Christ.


Austin: Yeah.


Jack: Too many people. I mean, I'll be real: one is too many.


Austin: Uh huh.


Jack: But six!


Austin: And it’s bad. It’s all bad stuff. Like, you don’t have to…


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: I won’t get into it, but it’s like all across the park and just truly terrible.


Jack: Wowee.


Ali: Okay. 


Dre: I'll link a video to the ride that I thought I was going to die on at Splashin’ Safari.


Austin: Okay.


Dre: It’s called Zinga.


Austin: Like the company.


Ali: I have now walked to the DMV on Google Maps. [laughs] 


Austin: Oh, nice.


Dre: Nice.


Austin: You made it.


Ali: From Coney Island.


Dre: Actually, maybe this isn’t the one I'm thinking of, but…


Jack: Oh, this looks great.


Austin: Going back and forth.


Ali: Yeah.


Austin: You love it.


Jack: I like the colors.


Austin: Yeah.


Jack: I feel like about halfway–


Austin: There’s a perspective trick thing happening, you know?


Jack: Yeah. Yeah. And it would make me feel like I was in hell for a bit there in the middle, which is sometimes kind of exciting.


Austin: Mm-hmm.


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: Well, then you splash out, and you're just in a little wave pool thing.


Jack: Just a tiny wave pool. [laughs] 


Austin: Yeah.


Dre: Sure.


Austin: All right.


Ali: Yeah.


Dre: Oh, no, this is– I misremembered. I found it. It’s called Bakuli.


Austin: Bakuli. Bakuli?


Jack: Bakuli.


Austin: Oh, weird.


Jack: Okay, what is this? It begins at the end of the ride, as someone is splashing down into another tiny wave pool, but we’re seeing…


Austin: Oh.


Dre: They’re not showing the part where you're like going down the enclosed part, and that part…


Austin: You go through that whole thing?


Dre: Yeah.


Austin: Wait, is it actually fully enclosed, or is it…?


Dre: Parts of it are, and then you go into that big toilet bowl part.


Austin: Oh, I see.


Ali: Oh.


Austin: You go– and then it does this little spin around. Oh, this is scary.


Dre: Mm-hmm. I think the part that was scary for me was the enclosed part.


Ali: Yeah.


Austin: Yeah, that makes sense. Well, like, I'm talking about–


Dre: I think I was like, “Oh, I'm going to tip over.”


Austin: This toilet bowl part with like the drain is really weird.


Dre: Mm-hmm.


Austin: The idea that I guess you–


Jack: You sort of circle around it, and then…


Austin: Yeah. And then fall into another enclosed part.


Jack: At which point, the video abruptly ends, with no fade. [Ali laughs]


Austin: Those children disappeared.


Dre: Uh huh. They’re all dead.


Austin: They didn’t die. They just disappeared, actually.


Dre: Nope.


Austin: They’re just gone.


Jack: The woman from Sangfielle who vanishes you. [laughs quietly] 


Austin: Uh huh. God.


Ali: The Tri-City Tunnel.


Austin: There it is.


Jack: The Tri-City Tunnel.


Austin: We didn’t clap, did we? We closed…


Ali: We didn’t. [laughs] 


Austin: We did?


Jack: Yeah, we saw…wait, no, we didn’t.


Ali: We did not. We did not.


Austin: Oh, we did not.


Dre: No, we have not clapped once.


Jack: No, because you said that you ate a hot dog on Good Friday.


Ali: Yeah. [laughs] 


Austin: Right. Yeah.


Jack: And then we took a turn. [Ali laughs] Should we clap at 10? 10 seconds past?


Ali: Mm-hmm.


Austin: Yes, let’s do it.


[clap]


Austin: All right.


Ali: That was not one of my best, but…


Austin: No, me either.


Dre: No. [Ali laughs]


Austin: Uh, do you want to do one more? Do you want to do 25?


Ali: No. No.


Austin: You're good? You're sure?


Ali: No, no, we’re fine. We’re fine.


Austin: Only four of us, you know?


Ali: Yeah. It’ll get figured out.


Austin: It’ll be fine. All right, let me get stuff open.
