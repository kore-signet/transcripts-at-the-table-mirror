ART: …Alright and everyone be careful not to be saying something weird when Austin throws to us.


AUSTIN: I’ll, I’ll give a ten second heads up that I’m going to come to y’all, okay?


ART: Nobody be asking if something’s horny when [Art cuts off abruptly; Sylvia laughs]


KEITH: Do we have a time for time.is?


ART: [crosstalk] Our fans cannot handle it.


SYLVIA: I’ll really try! [Jack laughs]


AUSTIN: Alright are we at time.is? [all respond with overlapping affirmations] 


KEITH: Fifteen?

AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Fifteen, Fifteen. [a four second pause, followed by a chorus of claps]


ALI: [quietly] Sounded perfect! [a long silence]


JACK: [just as quietly] And now, we all leave the call. [everyone laughs]


ALI: That would be so fucked up! That would be so fucked up!


JACK: [crosstalk] Austin just comes back… [everyone laughs]

JACK (as AUSTIN): Where is everybody?


ART: So we’re not doing that?


ALI: [with feeling] No!


JACK: [crosstalk] No! We’d do this in the dress rehearsal, if we were at a point where we would rehearse these things, but…


ALI: [quietly] God. 


ART: Oh, I think I quit the show that week. [Jack laughs] Uh- 


ALI: [interrupting, shocked] When we’re doing dress rehearsals?


ART: When we’re doing dress rehearsals for a post mortem?


ALI: [shocked] That’s your line?


ART: I think so. I don’t want to do it.


ALI: It seems like it would be a very standard practice, we would just like hop on and do like, a tech check? [Sylvia laughs]


KEITH: Check-


JANINE: That’s - I don’t think that’s what a dress rehearsal is, “dress rehearsal” to me feels like-


ART: [crosstalk] Yeah a dress rehearsal is in full costume.


KEITH: [crosstalk] I know that we [cuts himself off abruptly]


JANINE: You’re wearing a - everyone’s wearing a button-up shirt and…


ALI: Well you can wear whatever you want, what are you wearing right now? [laughing as she finishes her sentence, Art cackles] 


KEITH: I know - 


ALI: It’s gonna be - “Nobody say anything weird when Austin comes back.” [everyone laughs]


JACK: What are you going to wear to the… [Dre laughs]


KEITH: The, the second trend under “United States trends on Twitter” right now is just the word Jizz. [Sylvia guffaws, Janine makes a noise of trepidation]


ART: Oh that’s a soccer thing, there’s a guy named Jizz.


KEITH: [crosstalk] Oh, [reading] Dutch Footballer Ji-- Jizz Hornkamp.


ALI: [holding in a laugh] Wow, that’s tough. 


JANINE: [crosstalk] Oh no.


ART: Yeah he scored four goals today and the internet is not handling it well. [everyone laughs]
SYLVIA: Has that been quote tweeted with “Is this a Friends at the Table character” by anybody? [everyone laughs]


ART: I think you could be the first!


SYLVIA: Nah, I’m good.


KEITH: It’s really easy, I bet it’s really easy to be trending if your name is Jizz [Sylvia laughs] because as soon as people see that Jizz is trending they, a million people just tweet that Jizz is trending. 


JACK: [crosstalk] It’s sort of a game where you try not to trend at that point, right?


KEITH: Yeah.

DRE: Mhm.

JACK: And you’re like, “Let’s see if I can’t do it this time.”


ALI: Sure.


KEITH (as Jizz): [put out] I’m sick of trending for my name. [a pause while Sylvia recovers]


SYLVIA (as Jizz): [put out] It’s a normal name! [Keith laughs] The ‘J’ is soft!


KEITH (as Jizz): [crosstalk] It’s Dutch!


ART: Awh, and it’s like, I don’t know, maybe everyone in the Netherlands is named that, it’s, I, there’re, there were eight Jizzes in his elementary school class. [Sylvia cracks up]


DRE: Mhm! Mhm!


KEITH: Maybe it’s a hard “J”.


JACK: Easy! Everybody!


ALI: We’re, yeah. 

AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Oh?


JANINE: Thirty seconds. [Dre laughing]


ART: Oh wow! That was so close!
ALI: [crosstalk] Get it all out. [pause]


ART: [said quickly, as if it was all one word] Jizz jizz jizz jizz jizz. [everyone laughs]


DRE: Man the new VSCO girl trends are real weird! [laughter continues]


KEITH: I don’t - I don’t get that one. 


JACK: Ten!


JANINE: Ten!


ART: Everyone get it together!


AUSTIN: [presumably after the stream starts] Hello, and welcome [his audio is cut as the laughter dies down] Interaction between good friends. 


ART: [crosstalk] Sure is! 


AUSTIN: I have no idea what everyone’s laughing about, because - [everyone laughs]


ART: Fun interaction between good friends!


AUSTIN: Great. Good. Very professional. I’m Austin Walker, joining me today, Ali Acamp--


[MUSICAL TRANSITION: TIMESTAMP: 3:54] 


AUSTIN: Totally. 


[Ali laughs, her voice distorted, as if it’s coming out of old, poorly-maintained speakers] 


AUSTIN: Oh! We got that Ali again!


DRE: [crosstalk] Oh!

KEITH: [crosstalk] Ali.


JANINE: [crosstalk] We got that pull-cord doll again.


ALI: [still distorted] Hi, hello? I’m, uh… Bye, good-bye! [all laugh]


JANINE: That’s what the dolls say. 


AUSTIN (As a doll): Bye! Thanks for stopping… by!
JANINE (As a doll): Hello, hi!


KEITH: [while laughing] An extremely unsure doll. [all laugh] They had one take to record the lines for the doll, she forgot her lines, and they kept it, pushed the doll out.


AUSTIN: Released the doll. [pause] Amazing.


JANINE: It’s like that, the balloon kid in Five Nights at Freddy’s. One of those? Remember when they introduced the balloon kid? Who would show up with balloons, it was like the second one or something?


KEITH: No.


ALI: [robotic, unintelligible words]


JANINE: The balloon kid would just be like “Hi!” and then you’d get murdered if you didn’t do… something specific, I don’t know. 


SYLVI: [crosstalk] I thought the balloon boy was um…


ALI: [back to normal, plaintively] Do I sound like a balloon kid?


AUSTIN: No, you’re good. 


KEITH: [crosstalk] No. 


JANINE: [crosstalk] You’re good, you’re good now.


ALI: Okay, this is concerning.


[MUSICAL TRANSITION: TIMESTAMP: 4:59] 


KEITH: There’re a lot of kids trying to play your instruments?


JACK: My-my mother is a piano teacher. 


AUSTIN: I thought you were going to say, “is a child”. [Keith laughs]


JACK: [laughing] My mother is a child.


AUSTIN (as Jack): My mother is a child, so, I mean. Always. 


JACK: [laughing] I’m a character from one of Wes Anderson’s… Weaker movies.


KEITH: [crosstalk] She used to be an adult!


AUSTIN: [laughing, crosstalk] Yeah.


KEITH: There was a wish gone wrong. 


AUSTIN: Yeah. 


JACK: It’s like, you know?


KEITH: [crosstalk] Emperor Pilaf!


JACK: [scolding] Don’t bang the piano! [as a response, vehemently] It’s fun to bang a piano! It’s fun to make a loud sound on an instrument!


KEITH: It sure is!


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] It simply is. This is just the truth isn’t it?


KEITH: And! You know, I’m not a piano expert by any means, but banging on a, banging on a piano does not seem like - that is a, that is a, that is a hardy instrument. 


JACK: Those things weigh more than a car!


AUSTIN: Yeah you should be recording.


ART: This is good shit! It’s all gone. 


JACK: Awh, that’s fine. It’s fine. 


KEITH: Like, with a child’s strength, is there a world where banging on a piano could really be an issue for the instrument?


JACK: Not really, adults don’t like children to be loud, which on one level I can understand because, based on my experience, being an adult is just constantly exhausting?


AUSTIN: And loud!


JACK: But at the same time, being a child, it’s very enjoyable to be loud. 


KEITH: Yeah it’s one of the most fun….


ART: Can I tell you all about a thing I heard on TikTok this week?


SYLVIA: [vehemently] Please! Oh my god!


JACK: [crosstalk] Yeah, go for it! I love that platform!


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Sure.


ALI: [crosstalk] Sure. More TikTok history, huh?


ART: So people on TikTok love right now to get like one of those viral stitch things? Like, to be the first part of like, a hundred TikToks?


KEITH: [crosstalk] Oh, yes.


ART: And someone had one this week that was like:


ART (as the TikTok): Okay, you’re going to have a worldwide televised boxing match against Mike Tyson. 


JACK: [crosstalk] Oh I saw this! [laughs] I saw this! I have an answer. 

ART (as the TikTok): And you can pick how old Mike Tyson is between one and eighteen. 


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Ooh.


ALI: [crosstalk] Mhm.


ART (as the TikTok): And if you win the fight, you get a million dollars for every age that Mike Tyson is.


AUSTIN: [Overlapping] Oh. 


ART: And they’re like: 


ART (as the TikTok): And to help, Mike Tyson started to learn boxing at thirteen. 


ART: And I’m like: ‘two million dollars is a lot of money, and I can beat up any two-year-old’. [Ali and Sylvia laugh]


AUSTIN: [Unintelligible] Dude.


KEITH: [crosstalk] Yeah! 


JACK: [crosstalk] Yeah! This is bad! Six, maybe!


KEITH: [crosstalk] This is a bad, this is a problem with those.


AUSTIN: Okay well wait wait wait, does the world know? Does the world see you do it?


JACK: Aw, no we’re in a Black Mirror situation. 


ART: [crosstalk] I don’t care, two million dollars is enough.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Two million dollars is not enough, no, no. 


ALI: [crosstalk] Yeah…


JACK: Two million dollars to beat up a child is not enough! 


AUSTIN: That’s not enough you’re going to jail, you can’t do this!


KEITH: [crosstalk] It’s, you can…


ART: Well it’s a sanctioned boxing match. 


AUSTIN: No it’s not, ‘cause he’s a child! 


SYLVIA: [crosstalk] That’s what I assumed as well. 


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] He’s not! He’s a child! It can’t be sanctioned. 


SYLVIA: What if his parents signed off on it?


KEITH: I think you can win a boxing match… I think you can win…


ALI: [crosstalk] Yeah, let’s go on a boxing cruise. 


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] How expensive is it to buy fight island so I never have to leave it?


JACK: [laughing] JoCo Boxing Cruise.


KEITH: I think you can win a boxing match against a two year old without actually hurting the two year old. 


AUSTIN: Ohhh. 


JACK: [crosstalk] That’s a good point!


ART: [crosstalk] Yeah that’s the thing, you could win by decision. 
KEITH: [crosstalk] Yeah.


AUSTIN: Oh, no, because they have to, no, you’re thinking of wrestling, because I could pin a two-year-old [Sylvia laughs] but to win a boxing match, you have to win the fight. You have to knock the person out. 


SYLVIA: [crosstalk] You could do like, very light jabs?


JACK: [crosstalk] Well…


KEITH: [crosstalk] If I…


ART: No, I could just knock him down a bunch of times, he’s not gonna knock me down. 


KEITH: Yeah!


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] True, I guess you could T.K.O. Yeah. [pause]


KEITH: Totally, totally, yep!


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Well no, this is the thing, if they’re counting to ten this child’s been hurt!


KEITH: They’re so…


JACK: [crosstalk] Or is asleep!


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Oh wait! Wait! Okay but wait!


KEITH: [crosstalk] Or has given up?


ART: [crosstalk, unintelligible] What if I win by T.K.O.


ALI: [crosstalk] Give him twenty thousand to throw the fight!


AUSTIN: Choose a one-year-old, they can’t walk anyway sometimes!


JACK: [crosstalk] Yeah, exactly!


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: You don’t even have to touch ‘em! He’s just gonna crawl! It’s fun to crawl!


KEITH: The risk/reward on that second million though, why not? I think that, I mean, it’s so easy to win a boxing match against a two year old. [pensive silence]
AUSTIN: Right! 


KEITH: Yeah. 


JACK: At which point, that’s a victory right? [Sylvia starts laughing] 


AUSTIN: And you could win by points too, right? One -- That ain’t bad.


KEITH: Someone is giving you this two million dollars which means they must have set up something.


ART: Well, they’re gonna get the broadcast rights for this fight. 


AUSTIN: Right.


JACK: Hang on, also, time travel is real, right? [Sylvia laughs] 


KEITH: [crosstalk] I, I th…


DRE: [crosstalk] Mmmmm! Okay!


AUSTIN: Well, no no no, we, only very limited time travel, we’re changing the age of Mike Tyson. 


KEITH: [crosstalk] I liked it more when we…


JACK: [crosstalk] Mike-Tyson-based time travel.


AUSTIN: I don’t think we’re going to a time, because if time travel is available to us, then, fuck it, yeah. [pause] I’ll go back in time and beat up a two-year-old Mike Tyson before anyone knew who that was and then come back to the future.


JACK: Still jail though at that point. 


ALI: [crosstalk] No!


SYLVIA: [crosstalk] ‘Give me my goddamn money’, the most grim version of Looper. [all laugh]


AUSTIN: Mike Tyson today is in debt, and you make an agreement with him to go back in time and beat him up for millions of dollars, to split the proceeds with him to pay off his debt.


KEITH: He organizes a --


JACK: [crosstalk] Oh sorry, Charlie Brooker has just entered my room. He’s going to take over the microphone now.


JACK (In a deep voice, as Charlie Brooker): Oh hello, I’m Charlie Brooker. 


JACK: Fucking hate Charlie Brooker. 


AUSTIN: That is the uh, that is the Black Mirror man for people who are unfamiliar. 


SYLVIA: [crosstalk] Oh, okay. 


AUSTIN: Let me send a link. 


JACK: What if technology was bad though? Have we considered?


AUSTIN: Have we?


SYLVIA: Personally speaking I think that would be really messed up. 


[pause]


JACK: Uh oh! Janine, are you? 


[pause]


AUSTIN: Janine’s everything froze. [pause] That’s no good. 


ART: Do you need more than that?


ALI: I have a short announcement to make by the way. 


AUSTIN: Hi!


KEITH: Oh are we in the announcement phase?


ALI: [laughing] No, I just! Um, I made a grocery order yesterday that I thought was going to come yesterday, and they called me twenty minutes ago to be like:

ALI (as grocery clerk): Do you still want your groceries?


AUSTIN: And you were like, ‘yes?’


ALI: So, yeah um, so I might be getting a call sometime within the next twenty minutes and then we’ll need to take a break at some point for like five minutes to let them into my building and like…


ART: Well I have an announcement to make… Oh it’s, wait Keith, did you have an announcement?


KEITH: Uh, no, no, I just wanted to make sure that we were all set for announcements. 


ALI: [crosstalk] Uh huh. 


ART: Well I do have an announcement. At some point, Jess is gonna come home, and the way this place is layed out, she’s gonna scare the fucking shit out of me. [everyone laughs] And I just need everyone to be cool when that happens. 


AUSTIN: Can you have her message us, so that we can tell her to wait by the door and then give like a really appropriately spooky time to come in? [Ali laughs] 


JACK: [laughing] Oh, that’s amazing.


ALI: [crosstalk] Why is it so scary?


KEITH: [crosstalk] I wanna get the scare on mic. 


ART: Oh, cause she’s just, the front door is at like my ten-’o’-clock, and it’s just at the edge of my peripheral vision, and I can’t hear anything. 


DRE: [crosstalk] Hmm. 


ALI: [crosstalk] Ooh. Sure, sure, yeah that’s terrifying. 


JACK: [distant] That’s so fucking funny.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Sure, sure, that’s how it goes!


KEITH: [crosstalk] Yeah. This happens to me all the time, when the door to my office is open, if a cat or a human walks through the door, I can’t see them until they’re like right next to me, out of the corner of my eye, it startles me every time and it’s like three feet away from me, which is embarrassing. [Ali laughs empathetically]


JACK: Session one of our horror season we’re gonna try to scare Art to death. [group chuckles, long pause]


KEITH: I’ll say it, I don’t want to scare Art to death. I want Art to be alive and not scared to death.


ART: [crosstalk] Thank you Keith! Glad someone…


ALI: [crosstalk] Yeah!
KEITH: [crosstalk] Everyone seemed not so sure, I’m sure.


ALI: It’s, yeah. 


JACK: [pompously] I’ll hear an argument. [Keith laughs]


AUSTIN: [gravelly] I mean I’ll hear the argument, I’m not gonna commit one way or another at this point. 


JACK: We got undead in this world yet Austin?


AUSTIN: [even more gravelly] Yeah!

JACK: [equally gravelly] Yeah! They’re, they’re, they’re out there somewhere.


KEITH: [crosstalk] Vampires!


AUSTIN: Vampires, sure! Well, they’re not, [hums a high note] I guess. Some of them are undead. 


JACK: [crosstalk] Vampires? Oh sure! Wh - I dunno, like, do we have like, skeletons, and zombies and shit?


KEITH: [crosstalk] Yeah.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Yeah!


KEITH: I guess it depends on your vampire lore whether vampires are like biologically alive and change.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] We, we do, there’s a lot of, we have, trust me Keith, we have every, we have every…


JACK: [crosstalk] Vampire stuff is great. 


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Check the doc I sent around, there’s some info on damn vampires in there. 


JACK: [crosstalk] Sylvi, where are the uh, are the vampires from all over or are they from one of the Cantons specifically? 


SYLVIA: I think we… I think it’s more all over.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] They’re all over! 


SYLVIA: Yeah. 


AUSTIN: Yeah, because it doesn’t- they’re not a single thing.


SYLVIA: [crosstalk] Yeah. 


JACK: What’s a vampire? Anything that takes something from… do we have a definition like that?


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Anything that extends their lifetime, their life, by sapping the life of something else. That’s what we mean by vampire. 


ART: How much blood potency do you have to spend to eat a meal?


AUSTIN: That depends on what kind of vampire you are, Art! 


ART: Hmm!


AUSTIN: You know, are you a gangrel, or are you a ven-no, no, it’s not that.


SYLVIA: [crosstalk] Oh my god. [with feeling] We’re not doing this! 


JACK: [crosstalk] Valkavian.


DRE: [crosstalk] Interesting, interesting. 


AUSTIN: No, no! But it is like, I’m sure that it’s like, well, are you a human who has entered into a blood pact with the god of life, or are you a warlock who has consumed some magical reagents to give you the ability to sap life from other people or are you infected by something from the heartland? Um, all of-


ART: What if I’m just like, hanging out and trying to keep my options open? [Ali cracks up]


KEITH: You’ve gotta have a Colin Robinson. 


AUSTIN: I think you’ve got to pick one. 


SYLVIA: [crosstalk] Yeah you’re probably not a vampire yet then. 


AUSTIN: You’ve got to pick some method. Yeah, some vampiric method. 


ALI: [crosstalk] You can keep your options open!


JACK: Although if you are interested in keeping your options open, I believe there is a church in the Heartland who would be very interested in hearing from you!


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Yeah! There is. [laughs]


JACK: [distantly] A gang of noncommittal losers! Full name TBD!


AUSTIN: TBD. [pause] No, they have a name now!


ART: It’s The Noncommittal Losers. [all laugh]


AUSTIN: Yeah they’re called The Noncommittal Losers. 


JACK: [crosstalk] What are these guys called? 


AUSTIN: Um they’re called the… they’re in here!


JACK: [crosstalk] The Boundless Conclave! 


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] The Boundless Conclave! Is that right? Yeah.


SYLVIA: [crosstalk] Oh man, it would have been really good if that last word began with a D and they were the TBDs as well!


AUSTIN: The TBDs!


KEITH: [crosstalk] Oh, I thought you said, I, I thought you were trying to say The Boundless Dong-clave. [Sylvia, Art, and Keith crack up]


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] The Boundless Dongclave. 


SYLVIA: Also really good! I don’t know why I didn’t think of that! I, I need to change my character Austin, I’m now the founder of the Boundless Dongclave. 


[laughter]


AUSTIN: Great. Congrats.


SYLVIA: Thank you.


AUSTIN: On your success.


SYLVIA: [laughs] Oh my god.


[pause]


JACK: Let me see how the fire’s doing.


AUSTIN: I hope Janine’s computer is okay.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


ART: Yeah.


KEITH: Yeah.


ART: Everyone does.


ALI: [quietly] Yeah.


KEITH: I need a -- I need a quiet --


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] An ill wind has swept through the computer.


ALI: Ooh.


[Jack laughs from very far away]


KEITH: I need a quiet food to eat.


JACK: [from very far away] Through its cities and burghs.


ALI: I had a corner of sourdough bread.


AUSTIN: Ooh.


JACK: [back to normal] Aw, nice! Was it good?


ALI: Yeah. I enjoyed it!


AUSTIN: That’s good. That’s good bread.


ALI: [crosstalk] I had like, ordered stuff from a bakery and they didn’t give me -- They were like, we have to cancel your order because we don’t have any of this stuff, and I was like [slightly dejected] “Okay.” 


JACK: “Fair enough.”


ALI: Then, the other stuff that I had arrived, came with a loaf of sourdough bread, and I was like, “Oh.” [laughs] “Thank you.”


KEITH: [crosstalk] Nice.


JACK: [crosstalk] Wow! Did you have it with anything or was it just plain?


KEITH: [crosstalk] They must have heard from the other restaurant.


JACK: Yeah.


ALI: Just some butter. I feel like I should, like do a thing with it, like I should make, like an onion soup or something, but I don’t have that sort of time and Googling chops.


JACK: I’ve never made an onion soup. In that way. Is it complicated? It feels like… To produce something that intense.


ALI: [crosstalk] No.


DRE: No, it’s just time consuming.


ALI: Yeah. It’s just onions and broth and you just…


KEITH: And hunks of bread.


ALI: Yeah. [clears throat]


JACK: Food is good.


KEITH: Yeah.


ART: But time consuming is right.


ALI: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.


KEITH: I’ve also never made an onion soup.


JACK: Don’t they have like, a kind of cheesy top or something or am I thinking of a different thing?


KEITH: [reverently] Yeah, they sure do.


[Art laughs]


AUSTIN: They do.


ALI: [crosstalk] That is a French Onion Soup, yes indeed.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] They got all cheese.


ALI: Is that Swiss or provolone? Or is it like, dealer’s choice?


DRE: I believe it’s gruyere, actually. Traditionally.


ALI: Ohhh, right.


JACK: Oh, wow.


ART: The Frenchest of cheeses. That’s not true, what am I even saying.


KEITH: I think there’s a -- There’s a lot of American restaurants that just pick whatever cheese they have to use, I think.


ALI: Uh-huh, uh-huh.


KEITH: And so, you’ll end up with a bunch of different things.


JACK: [seemingly in a tone of great disdain] You’re gonna have to go to Albertsons or something. I don’t know, that’s…


KEITH: You want the gruyere, you’re gonna have to go to Albertsons.


AUSTIN: The only place for gruyere.


ALI: What’s -- What’s -- What’s wrong with Albertsons?


KEITH: I don’t even know what that is.


JACK: [crosstalk] No, I said that fondly!


ALI: Oh.


JACK: My disappointment there was that I missed going -- One of my favorite things when I was in California was walking in the sun in the evening to Albersons and buying a nice fish or something.


ALI: Oh, yeah.


DRE: Mhm!


JACK: And walking back to my house.


ALI: Albertsons is the grocery store, when I lived in California, that you could rent movies from.


JACK: Yes! Absolutely!


ALI: Yeah. And I… Yeah.


JACK: [crosstalk] Oh, yeah.


KEITH: I --


ART: Was this a Redbox, or did they have their own…


ALI: No, no, no, it was like, you, you -- It was like, cassette tapes because it was the 90s. [laughs] And I -- Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I--


ART: [crosstalk] Oh!


KEITH: I love a business that is -- Hi Janine.


[Ali laughs]


JANINE: Way to out that you think that Ali’s a teenager.


ART: Ali was just here.


ALI: Yeah, yeah, yeah. This was before. This was between ‘94 and…


KEITH: I love a retail store that is inexplicably also another thing.


ALI: Oh yeah.


DRE: Mm-hm.


ALI: Yeah.


KEITH: My favorite of which, I think I -- I think I have shared this before, but I was in Western Mass. and I saw -- [pauses to laugh] I saw a store called Dave’s Soda and Pet City.


[laughter]


DRE: Oh, that’s great.


KEITH: Yeah.


JACK: Oh, wonderful.


ALI: Shoutout to Dave.


DRE: Dave’s out here living his best life.


ALI: Yeah. A man for the community.


DRE: Making good bread, have a soda and pet city.


JACK: [crosstalk] Right.


ALI: [laughs] Oh yeah, Dave’s Bread! I haven’t gotten into Dave’s Bread.


KEITH: I get Dave’s Bread sometimes, it’s all right.


ART: Are we talking about Dave’s Killer Bread?


AUSTIN: Dave’s Killer Bread.


KEITH: Yeah.


ART: Okay, yeah. Great bread.


ALI: Really.


JACK: [crosstalk] I did also want to…


KEITH: I get their “White Bread Done Right” every once in a while. I think that’s pretty good.


ALI: Ooh.


ART: Yeah, they do it right there.


[Ali and Jack laugh]


ALI: I’m still on Arnold uh… multi-wheat or whatever the fuck I buy. [laughs] Anyway, hi Janine, you’re back! Hi.


JANINE: Yeah, that was like, a weird thing where Audacity stopped doing anything and then Discord stopped doing anything and then when I tried to force quit Audacity it just put the End Task button on my screen permanently and wouldn’t let me restart. So I had to hard-restart. And things seem okay now…?


JACK: Fingers crossed.


JANINE: Question mark?


JACK: Yeah. 


ART: They do seem okay now, I can confirm that.


AUSTIN: Yeah, seems like it’s working. All right, are we ready to do a time.is?


JANINE: [crosstalk] We’ll fucking see.


AUSTIN: Maybe 50?


[pause followed by a series of claps]


AUSTIN: A little all over the place, but… Okay.


KEITH: C-plus.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


SYLVIA: [laughs] Thank you.


AUSTIN: All right, I’m gonna drop a file into the chat. And we can all count it in and then hit play. Ready?


KEITH: Uh…


DRE: Ooh.


KEITH: All right, yeah, I’m ready.


AUSTIN: Three, two, one, go.


[MUSICAL TRANSITION: TIMESTAMP: 20:33]


DRE: Boy, I hope that weird dog noise didn’t just come through my microphone.


ALI: Did not hear it.


JACK: [crosstalk] No, I didn’t hear it.


AUSTIN: Not at all.


JACK: It would have been fun to hear.


JANINE: How weird was it?


DRE: Well, we’re dogsitting for my parents’ dog who is a… How old -- Wilson, how old are you? He’s like thirteen --


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Yeah, Wilson!


[Ali laughs]


KEITH: [In a Scooby-Doo-ish talking dog voice] Rarf! Thirteen! Rar! [normal voice] Let him answer!


[Jack laughs]


DRE: He’s thirteen, so he’s a very sweet, old man. And when he’s not getting attention, he likes to just make weird noises.


SYLVIA: [laughs] I’m the same way.


ALI: [crosstalk] That’s so cute.


[Janine chuckles]


KEITH: Yeah, old dogs like to grumble.


DRE: Earlier I got up to get my water, and when I came back, Wilson wouldn’t let me scoot up to the desk, because he was just like standing in front of it and was just like “No you’re gonna pet me now. There’s no way.”


AUSTIN: Buddy!


[Ali and Dre laugh]


[MUSICAL TRANSITION: TIMESTAMP: 21:23]


AUSTIN: So, really quick before we go back. Three kids, Twilight Mirage, she was a mare, had three kids. One with Bayern, and then that kid’s name was Bayern’s Mirage. This happens a lot with-- This is a thing, right? One with --


KEITH: I like that, though.


ART: You have to get creative if you have horses.


AUSTIN: One, Soldat, and that -- Or one with Soldat, and that one’s name Dassult Mirage, I don’t know what Dassult is, or how it connects to Soldat, but it must.


KEITH: Oh, they really do the Mirage thing a lot, huh.


JANINE: Yeah, they’re just rearranging it.


AUSTIN: Oh -- That’s not true because I’m looking at the way it’s spelled. It’s Dassult, so did they just swap -- They swapped sounds.


JANINE: They got there sideways, they got there sideways.


AUSTIN: Yeah. Finally - and this is the one, imo, had a lil’ kid with Closing Argument. And the name of that kid is Determinato.


JACK: Whoa!


ALI: Ooh.


KEITH: Nice. Very good.


AUSTIN: All time good name, we should name a character Something Determinato in this season.


ART: Yeah, dibs. [Austin laughs] I’m taking it.


AUSTIN: Determinato. [Ali laughs] You know? That ain’t bad.


JACK: It ain’t bad, is it.


AUSTIN: It ain’t, that ain’t bad!


JACK: Determinato’s Folly!


ART: It’s not a bad name for a season, honestly.


AUSTIN: Honestly, Determinato’s kinda good.


JACK: Let’s write it down and see how we feel.


KEITH: Ah, we can do a sequel called Determinato’s Mirage.


[laughter]


AUSTIN: Determinato’s… [breaks off laughing] People been saying they want to go back to Twilight Mirage, well here we go. Things got bad, everybody.


ALI: There’s devils now.


[Art and Keith laugh]


AUSTIN: All right, we should clap.


[pause]


JACK: You wanna do five after?


AUSTIN: Sure. [pause] Nope. Okay, ten after.


JACK: [crosstalk] Ten?


DRE: And not hit record yet.


AUSTIN: That’ll do it.


[sound of a single clap, with a series of other claps following behind]


AUSTIN: Okay, what happened?


JANINE: [crosstalk] What was that?


SYLVIA: [crosstalk] Yeah I got real behind there.


KEITH: I was on the ten after!


ALI: No you did not.


DRE: [crosstalk] No you did not.


ART: [crosstalk] You did not!
AUSTIN: Have you -- Have you not refreshed your time.is in the last three hours?


KEITH: Uh --


AUSTIN: It un-syncs.


KEITH: Maybe that’s true. I thought that I refreshed it.


AUSTIN: Okay. Let’s do one more. Let’s do one more at thirty.


JANINE: You were like two seconds ahead of us.


AUSTIN: Thirty, thirty.


[pause, sound of several claps much more in sync]


KEITH: Okay. That’s better.


AUSTIN: Jack, what’s the quote for tomorrow?


KEITH: [crosstalk] I could have sworn I refreshed it like, you know, ten minutes ago, but…


JACK: It is by Bernard Baruch, and he is saying to me: “Old age is always ten years older than I am.” 


KEITH: [sarcastically] Wow, so true.


JACK: Kind of like a C-tier quote, honestly, it’s kind of inoffensive.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Yeah.


KEITH: [crosstalk][sarcastically] I would love to have that on a pillow that is uncomfortable.


[chuckles]


KEITH: You know the kind of pillow that only says boring stuff and also it’s unusable?


AUSTIN: Yeah, I dug one of those up from the mines; it fucking sucks.


[laughter]


JACK: From the mines…


AUSTIN: All right.
[MUSICAL TRANSITION: TIMESTAMP: 24:20]


JACK: Getting those things sorted is a fucking nighmare every time.


SYLVIA: I bet.


JACK: Shaking a little - a little - a little plastic piece of fruit with some -- I don’t know what’s inside shakers.


SYLVIA: I do love that they are universally fruit, though. I was picturing a fruit with some beads in it.


JACK: It’s fruit, it’s eggs. Yeah, I got a pepper, I got a red pepper. I got a banana. Most of the Marielda stuff is just a classic, classic egg.


SYLVIA: [laughs] Yeah, no. Same with me back then.


[laughter]


AUSTIN: [amused] Shut the fuck up.


SYLVIA: Sorry. [laughs]


AUSTIN: No it’s fine! God.


JACK: Oh god. You gotta have your shakers shaped like enjoyable things. Or a synthesizer. Which turns out to be much more preferable.


SYLVIA: [laughs] What if you had a synthesizer shaped like a red pepper. Or a banana.


JACK: Oh my god.


AUSTIN: That would be sick.


JACK: I have been looking, at like--


SYLVIA: Yeah?


JACK: I’ve been -- Oh man, there’s a synth manufacturer, who’s name I’ve immediately forgotten.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] I typed “novelty synthesizers” into Google.


JACK: They’re so good. I was looking at one the other day that was like, an early synthesizer built for children.


AUSTIN: Yeah…


JACK: That you like, pulled little pegs out of and put them in other places.


AUSTIN: Oh, that’s cool.


JACK: And it goes for like $500 now.


AUSTIN: Of course, of course. This is how it goes, right.


SYLVIA: I was searching for “fruit-shaped synthesizer” and just got people doing like, modular synthesizer stuff with fruit.


AUSTIN: With fruit, yeah, sure.


JACK: Here is the Mego Muson synthesizer, which is this one that I was talking about, where you move little pegs around to set up an arpeggiator.


AUSTIN: Ooh.


[several arpeggios play in succession]


AUSTIN: That’s fun.


SYLVIA: Oh, that’s different than what I thought.


AUSTIN: This sounds like an Atari 2600 game in the best way.


JACK: It really does have those vibes!


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: But there’s a synth manufacturer called -- He works under the name Love Holtén, who just makes these incredible…


SYLVIA: Good name. 


JACK: It’s a really good name. Just like, weird synths and synth casings.


SYLVIA: I’m just like, in love with the plastic-y aesthetic of these. That teeth one is so good!


JACK: The teeth one is so good!


AUSTIN: Oh my god. These rule.


JACK: If I had -- If I had thousands and thousands of dollars I would buy a synth that I really like, like by another manufacturer and bring it to him to be like “Turn this into something beautiful.”


AUSTIN: Yeah. These ones that are like - are these like terrariums, what are these? The ones that have like, the big -- Or they almost look like a cycloscopes or something maybe actually? But one of them obviously has plants in it, so… Here, wait, this… The one I’m gonna copy and paste here, looks like it has some plant life in it to me? Or maybe it’s fractals? I don’t know what it is.


JACK: [crosstalk] Oh my god, it’s gorgeous. Oh yeah!


SYLVIA: It could also be like, a nonliving plant in there for display.


AUSTIN: That’s totally possible.


SYLVIA: But it looks sick. I want it.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk] No, this says it’s fractals and self-similar patterns.


SYLVIA: Oh, that’s so much better.


AUSTIN: Oh, I think that there’s a video. There’s a video.


[two deep, atmospheric synth notes play]


AUSTIN: Oh this sounds sick.


JACK: It looks like those are keyboard keys, like…


AUSTIN: Yeah. Oh, this looks so sick. This is some… [more deep, atmospheric synth notes play] This is Xanadu from Kentucky Route Zero. The big… Oh, wow. This is sick. Can I get this for my desk?


SYLVIA: That’s so nuts.


JACK: He made one called Bivalvia, which was pretty famous. Or, you know. Did the rounds. Which is a sort of a raspberry pie of synthesizers, in this tiny beautiful box with computer keyboard keys powering it.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm.
JACK: And I just -- They’re so gorgeous.


AUSTIN: Yeah, this is cool.


SYLVIA: [laughing] I do love that they’re also just selling an armchair.


AUSTIN: Listen. You gotta…


JACK: [laughs] You know!


SYLVIA: Yeah! It looks comfy, it looks like a regular armchair.


JACK: Imagine if -- Imagine if we branched out in this way where it’s like, we make four podcasts and also we will sell you like, lampshades.


AUSTIN: Yeah. There’s probably more money in lampshades, right? I could probably pay down my debt if we were in the lampshade business.


JACK: We could do it. Patreon’s here. $8,000 dollars a month to make lampshades.


AUSTIN: To make lampshades. To make me not Tweet, and also lampshades. All right. We should do a podcast. Y’all ready?


JACK: Let’s do it.


SYLVIA: Yeah.


[MUSICAL TRANSITION: TIMESTAMP: 28:50]


JACK: Okey-doke!


[Ali yawns]


AUSTIN: Okay, twenty?


ALI: Uh, uh, uh, wait.


AUSTIN: You got time. [Ali laughs] No? Twenty-five.


DRE: Okay.


[Ali continues laughing]


[pause, series of claps]
AUSTIN: What happened, Ali?


ALI: I was typing roll20 and then I was remembering the trauma of when that happened last time, so I got it all mixed up.


DRE: [crosstalk] Oh no. A flashback.


ALI: And then I was typing “time-is-dot-net” ‘cause I remembered the dot-net.


AUSTIN: Right.


[Dre and Ali laughing]


DRE: What is timeis.net, let’s see.


AUSTIN: Don’t -- Be careful.


ART: Yeah, be careful.


AUSTIN: Don’t get a virus.


DRE: It’s nothing. It’s nothing, it looks like.


ALI: Don’t get arrested.


AUSTIN: Don’t get arrested?


ALI: Didn't you just say that?


AUSTIN: No, I said “Don’t get a virus.”


ART: “Don’t get a virus.”


[Ali laughs]


DRE: Or get arrested.


AUSTIN: Or get arrested, please, yeah.


ART: Yeah, don’t get arrested.


ALI: Yeah.


DRE: I don’t know, it’s a website with one sentence in a language that I don’t recognize.
AUSTIN: Great.


DRE: I think it might be Dutch? I don’t know.


ALI: Oh.


JACK: Well, that is the language of time.


[Ali laughs]


AUSTIN: That’s true. That’s what they say.


DRE: [laughing] That is what they say.


ART: That’s gonna be one of the quotes on time.is one day.


AUSTIN: [laughing] “Dutch is the language of time.” That’s what we’ll say. All right.


ART: We should buy time.is, that should be one of our…


[Jack laughs]


AUSTIN: I don’t think we can afford it.


JACK: God, what a useless purchase.


DRE: [crosstalk] I wonder what time.is is worth.


AUSTIN: I bet that’s very expensive.


ALI: Wait, if you own time.is though, what would you do, ‘cause I have some changes to make to time.is.


JACK: Oh yeah.


ART: Well, put ‘em in the blue sky document--


AUSTIN: Yeah, don’t say it publicly. They’ll change it ahead of us, raise the valuation up, and then it’ll cost us more to buy it.


ALI: Sure. Sure, sure, sure.


AUSTIN: We have to save our improvement ideas.


JACK: But not if we say “no business” before it.


ART: We’re gonna Shark Tank these motherfuckers.


JACK: Yeah.


ALI: We have to quote higher.


JACK: That’s why everybody logs on. Other than the time, I suppose.


[Ali laughs]


AUSTIN: What’s the quote today?


ART: I guess, at some point, in the “buying time.is” discussion, I would want to know if anyone but us is using the damn thing. If it’s just--


AUSTIN: It is! I’ve guested on podcasts of people go “All right, we should go to time.is” without saying that they got it from -- Runbutton, is where this comes from. This comes from Runbutton. This is not a Friends at the Table original, so shoutouts to Runbutton. But like, the lineage is not --


ALI: Oh. 


AUSTIN: People say it to me like I’ve never heard of time.is and I laugh to myself quietly and then do a podcast as a nice guest because I’m polite. Instead of saying “You know I know what time-dot is, don’t you?”


[Ali laughs]


ART: Yeah. Who said this to you, though? It feels…lowkey disrespectful.


AUSTIN: [crosstalk[ It’s gaming podcasts. They don’t know! Why would they know, they don’t listen to our shit, you know? [pause] Um, I’m never gonna fucking do an NFT in my fucking life. If anyone I know does an NFT, I don’t know them anymore, is actually how it works.


[Ali giggles]


DRE: Mm-hm, mm-hm.


ART: I mean, doing a pod- Someone’s gonna do a podcast NFT, and it’s gonna be so funny, ‘cause it doesn’t make any sense to do.


AUSTIN: No, it’s gonna happen for sure. Who’s the-- Kings of Leon are doing the analysis -- Audio’s been breached. So…


JACK: No, here’s the thing: Just steal it! Whenever you see someone do an NFT, just press the home button and the little thing on the side of your phone at the same time, and then it’s yours! Then you’ve got it!


AUSTIN: Yes.


JACK: Fuck those guys!


ART: And then sell your own NFT of your copy of the thing.


JACK: No, Art!


[laughter]


ART: I don’t know, I understand the ecological impacts are the biggest thing and it’s a big problem, but stealing money from gullible rich people is never all the way wrong.


JACK: [laughs] There are other, better ways.


AUSTIN: Yeah.
