Clapcast 03: Please Don't Tell Disney
Transcribed by: Emily (@tempestemily)


AUSTIN (hesitantly): Um, okay, ahh… time.is… start recording...


ART (overlapping): Isn’t… Oh, is Sylvia[1] back?


SYLVIA (hurriedly): I’m back I’m back [clears throat]. Yeah, sorry, I had to tweak my gain so you guys can’t- so my dog doesn’t get picked up, basically.


KEITH: Okay, time.is… 


[SYLVIA chuckles]


KEITH: Alright you guys, it does not look like I’m going to be able to mess the sound on this Star Wars card, which sucks.


DRE: Are you like, tryin’ to reduce or increase the volume?


KEITH: No, no, I was just gonna add like, distortion and a pitch bend.
.
DRE: Ah, okay.


KEITH: Which is very easy on something like a, like a… what are they called, the say-and-spell, speak-and-spell? Like, any kids’ toy essentially, but the chip on here is just too small. There’s not enough…


[CROSSTALK, AUSTIN and DRE humming in understanding]


ART: I think its a see-and-say, and I think we are now officially the nerdiest podcast.


[AUSTIN and DRE laugh]


ART: I think we finally made it.


DRE: Welcome to my chopped and screwed Star Wars theme music podcast.


ART: Yeah. Welcome to We’re Hackin’ the Star Wars Birthday Card.


[The Star Wars theme song begins playing muffled in the background]


DRE: No, that's just instructables.com. Again, this already exists.


[Long pause, as the Star Wars theme plays]


SYLVIA: Every time you play this, we can’t use it for anything because we’re going to get sued.


[KEITH and DRE laugh]


DRE: Its-


KEITH: Its not long enough to get sued, I know-


AUSTIN (overlapping): No, it’s Disney, and yes they fucking will, trust me.


KEITH: It’s- I guess that's fair.


SYLVIA: They’re going to sue us, then buy us, and we’re gonna be in the Marvel universe, but we’re not going to get anything from it.


[SYLVIA, KEITH, and AUSTIN all talk at once]


SYLVIA: That's how it works!


KEITH: Its parody. It was parody. We made a whole fake scene!


AUSTIN (overlapping): Yep, have fun. No, its not. It is not. I promise.


KEITH: I mean, it is, we just have to prove it with lawyers.


AUSTIN: Which we definitely have, right Art?


SYLVIA: To take on Disney.


AUSTIN: Art, how do you feel about lawyers right now?


ART: Ah, I love them and their reasonable fee schedules


[AUSTIN and DRE laugh]


KEITH: I read The Firm, I know that’s not true. My uncle is a real-estate lawyer, does that help?


AUSTIN: No, no.


[SYLVIA laughs]


AUSTIN: I mean, are we buying property soon, or?


KEITH: I hope!


AUSTIN: Yeah.


[brief pause]


ART: At the The Friends at the Table dome.


KEITH (overlapping): Listen, we don’t want to just be shoveling money into the rental market. Wait for the next crash, and then pounce! Friends at the Table HQ.


[SYLVIA groans]


KEITH: We’ll have to put it like at uh, geographical midpoint between all of our locations, which will probably end up being like an island.


ART: No, aren’t I about as far from New York as Jack is?


AUSTIN: Yeah.


KEITH: I think that Jack is another thousand miles, I thought.


AUSTIN (overlapping): No, I think its the other way, isn’t it? How- mmm. Lets see…


[ART and KEITH both talk at once]


ART: But then there’s also- 


KEITH: I think its three thousand to California, and I thought it was four thousand to-


ART: But then Dre, Sylvia, and Janine are also pulling it west.


AUSTIN: It depends on- yeah, are we- well, are we…


SYLVIA: Huh?


AUSTIN: Is it weighted?


DRE: Right.


KEITH: Its not weighted. Its the- its the- I guess its the average. So its like-


AUSTIN (overlapping): Right, because the thing is with two of us in New York, that just fucks with it.


KEITH: And I’m in Rhode Island.


AUSTIN: Right, like it's all- the Eastern Seaboard’s got it.


KEITH: Yeah.


SYLVIA (overlapping): I don’t think Janine and I are pulling that far west either.


KEITH (overlapping): I think- I mean best case scenario it's gonna be like, its gonna be like, off the coast of New York, or in like, Pennsylvania. 


ART: Yeah I think, I think Pennsylvania’s probably a pretty safe bet.


KEITH: Alright, Friends at the Table HQ, Pennsylvania. Let's do it.


ART (overlapping): I hope we get Philly or Pittsburgh, because otherwise it sucks there.


[KEITH laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah, it sucks, let me tell ya.


DRE: That’s true.


KEITH (overlapping): Well, hold on a second. I think at that point, we can sort of wiggle room. Like, if it’s a suburb of one of the cities, we can probably just be like ‘eh, its the city, actually.’


[AUSTIN and ART both talk at once]


ART: Or it’s like-


AUSTIN: I mean, like, I’ll take a suburb of a city, I just don’t want to be in rural PA. 


ART (overlapping): Yeah, it’s the middle-


KEITH (overlapping): Well there’s not, they don’t have the infrastructure.


ART: The middle of Pennsylvania is basically, is basically Alabama.


KEITH: They don’t have the infrastructure to support it at Friends at the Table HQ, the building doesn’t exist.


AUSTIN: I see.


ART: Well that's how we’re gonna get it for cheap, we’re gonna- we’re gonna build our own tower there.


AUSTIN: Mm-hm.


KEITH: Oh, we could do that. We could buy one of those ghost towns. Friends at the Table can-


AUSTIN (Overlapping): Oh, isn’t- isn’t Silent Hill in PA? The movie one?


ART: Is it?


AUSTIN (googling): Yeah, Centralia. Centralia is in Pennsylvania. 


ART: Oh, Ali would love that.


DRE (overlapping): There’s a uh… 


AUSTIN: Let me see…


DRE: There’s an abandoned wild west theme park in a mountain that you can buy in Kentucky.


AUSTIN: I wanna see, what, (googling) how much… Centralia… real estate… Pennsylvania. 


SYLVIA: Hold on, I wanna live in the abandoned theme park.


ART (overlapping):What are we waiting on to clap at this point?


AUSTIN (overlapping): Wait, Centralia…


KEITH (overlapping): Wait, hold on, I know exactly where we should build it: King of Prussia. King of Prussia, Pennsylvania is where we should build it.


AUSTIN (overlapping): There’s a big mall there.


KEITH: Yeah.


AUSTIN: Alright lets see, how- zero Centralia homes, hmm.


KEITH (overlapping: So we get the- so we can get the tourist spillover.


ART (overlapping): What about like, near Hershey Park?


AUSTIN: You don’t want to be near Hershey Park.


KEITH: Oh, that’s a…


ART: No? I’ve never been.


KEITH: That’s what you do if you wanna eat some shitty chocolate.


AUSTIN: It smells.


[KEITH and ART both talk at once]


KEITH: Oh yeah, I heard about that.


ART: Does it… does it smell like chocolate?


AUSTIN: Yeah, all the time, I hate it.


KEITH (overlapping): No, it smells like fa- but it smells like factory chocolate.


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah. Its just like a dense… anyway, lets clap.


KEITH (overlapping): It’s like the sw- It smells how baking chocolate tastes. Probably.


SYLVIA (exasperated): What time are clapping at?


ART (overlapping): Oh I- thats not the way I thought we were going with that. Like 5, 10 seconds? 28:10?


AUSTIN: Sorry, I’m looking at houses. Uh, yeah. Uh, 10. 10?


[Long pause]


[A series of claps]


SYLVIA: Hmm.


ART: 20?


AUSTIN (frustrated): Hmm 20.


[SYLVIA and KEITH laugh]


[a second cascade of claps]


AUSTIN (laughing): 30?


ART: That’s still not great.


AUSTIN: That was worse!


KEITH: Oh, for me it sounded better.


ART: 35, how about 35, maybe it's the zero.


AUSTIN: Could be.


[Long pause]


[More disjointed claps]


AUSTIN: That was better.


KEITH: THAT one sounded great to me.


DRE (overlapping): I think it was.


AUSTIN (overlapping): That was a- that was an improvement.


[AUSTIN sighs]


KEITH: What are you looking at houses for, is that for Friends at the Table HQ?


AUSTIN: Yeah, in Centralia, Pennsylvania, where it’s all on fire.


KEITH: Okay. Oh, okay.


SYLVIA: Hell yeah.


AUSTIN: Like us, cuz we’re lit. Alright, get- let me get some notes.


[NEW CLIP]




KEITH: Uh, it… They’re called “scalies,” if they have scales.


ART: Is that real? Huh.


KEITH: Yeah.


ART: I just figured it was all… I don’t know why I though this, but I thought that would be, like, uncomplicated, and simple...


KEITH: I…


ART: Like only one word, no matter what it is.


KEITH: Ooh, trus- there is nothing uncomplicated about furry shit.


[NEW CLIP]




AUSTIN: Okay, let’s time.is, lets clap.


SYLVIA: Alright.


ART: Alright.


KEITH: (opening time.is) time.is…


[typing sounds]


AUSTIN: I almost just clapped. I almost just-


[SYLVIA laughs]


AUSTIN: I was like ‘oh, time.is loaded up, clap [claps], time to be done, move on…’


[KEITH and DRE laugh]


KEITH: You know what would really help us for time.is?


AUSTIN (overlapping): Oh man… What's that?


KEITH: I would love- can we get umm… tenths of seconds, or like hundredths of seconds on here?


[SYLVIA sighs]


AUSTIN: Yeah. Yeah, you gotta, its a code though.


KEITH: Okay, how do we do that?


AUSTIN: Its a code.


KEITH: Its a code?!


AUSTIN: Yeah, you have to know the secret code.


KEITH (overlapping): Up up, down down…


AUSTIN: That's not it, that's a different code.


[SYLVIA sniffs]


DRE: I- I can’t tell if you’re being serious right now or not.


AUSTIN: You have to be a subscriber.


DRE: Fuckin- Austin.


KEITH (incredulous): Really? A subscriber?


AUSTIN: Mm-hm. Premium membership to time.is 


[DRE and KEITH both talk at once]


DRE: The fuck.


KEITH: I was gonna say...


AUSTIN: They have an app. Wait, they have an app? Its well-regarded!


[SYLVIA laughs]


AUSTIN: 30 ratings!


KEITH (overlapping): Oh, time.is, I didn’t realize…


AUSTIN: Four and a half, four and a half stars...


KEITH: I didn’t think they could pull out an app!


AUSTIN (reading): Your time is exact… If my phone time is not exact, I’m gonna be upset.


KEITH (also reading): Customize…


DRE: You can make it uh… Ooh, there’s a night mode! For time.is.


AUSTIN: Yeah, night mode is great.


KEITH: Oh, I live in night mode. I live in it.


AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah. Same.


[DRE laughs]


AUSTIN: Actually, I don’t remember how to get to it, how do I turn on night mode?


DRE: You have to be a subscriber.


SYLVIA: Ooh.


AUSTIN (loudly): Fuck.


DRE: You have to have a premium membership, Austin.


AUSTIN (laughing): Dammit.


KEITH: Ooh, timezone news!


[SYLVIA and ART laugh]


AUSTIN: Hell yeah.


KEITH (reading): ‘Permanent summertime in Namibia,’ I don’t know what- where that is.


AUSTIN: You know what it should do? It should go into night mode the second its night time, by default.


SYLVIA: It should just use like-


AUSTIN (overlapping): Oh, here we go-


SYLVIA: Do whatever f.lux does, where it slowly gets darker.


AUSTIN: Right. Uh, white on black, alright, and customize, I gotcha. Goddamn, it would have-


ART: Where are these options? I don’t see any of these.


AUSTIN: It would have been really cool if there were hundredths of seconds, and I was just bullshitting and then there was, that would have been nice. Oh, I can change the font…


KEITH (overlapping): Wow, this is dramatic. 


AUSTIN: I’m gonna go-


KEITH: Can I give you guys a little bit of, of uh, timezone news?


AUSTIN: Yeah, please.


DRE: Please do.


KEITH: Uh… (reading) “4th of April,” no, sorry, “29th of April, 2016: Egypt brings back Daylight Savings Time. 7th of July, 2016: Egypt cancels reintroduction of Daylight Savings Time.”


AUSTIN: Wow. Huge- big spin.


KEITH: Yeah. It's a rollercoaster.


AUSTIN: Question: is there a culture that starts the week on Saturday?


[typing sounds]


DRE: Maybe.


SYLVIA: There is now, and it’s mine.


AUSTIN (laughing): Um… I ask that because on time.is you can change the first day of the week, and its either Monday, Sunday, or Saturday. And- none of the other days. Like, its not just like ‘yeah, pick whatever day you need.’ 


ART: Saturday makes more sense than Sunday.


KEITH (overlapping): Was that a-


DRE (overlapping): Isn’t there…?


KEITH: Wasn’t that a twitter thing recently? Where it was like ‘does the week start on Monday or on Sunday?’


AUSTIN: Why?


ART: Because Sunday bisects the weekend. Saturday is like, the weekend is the start. Monday is the week as the start.


AUSTIN: My dude, we are not starting the week with a thing called ‘the weekend,’ we cannot do this.


[KEITH and SYLVIA laugh]


SYLVIA: Is the weekend a sandwich?


ART (overlapping): Alright, the pre-week-


AUSTIN: Oh my god, I fucking hate everyone.


[SYLVIA and DRE laugh]


AUSTIN: And not an ironic sort of fun hate, either.


KEITH: Its-


[SYLVIA laughs]


KEITH: Its the fa- we just change it from the ‘weekend’ to like the ‘fade-in.’


[AUSTIN sighs]


ART: Look, we can hang out at next week’s pre-show, and talk about this.


DRE: Oh, hold on. In the Persian calendar, Sunday is the second day of the week, uh… and Saturday, the first day, is noted as ‘zero’ on the days of the week.


SYLVIA: Hm.


AUSTIN: Oh, that’s sick.


[KEITH and AUSTIN both talk at once]


KEITH: It would be interesting if like the second day-


AUSTIN: More like ‘get zero work done,’ am I right? Boom. Sleep in.


[KEITH laughs]


KEITH: It would be interesting if Sunday was the second day, but some other day was the first day.


AUSTIN: ...Other than Saturday?


KEITH: Other than Saturday, yeah.


AUSTIN (exasperated): Okay…


KEITH: Just the  way that that was- that fact was presented. 


AUSTIN: Mm-hm.


KEITH: “Sunday is the second day, but zero- Saturday is zero.”


[typing]


AUSTIN: Alright, we’re gonna clap.


SYLVIA: We need to.


[DRE laughs]


KEITH: Why, did that not fizzle- did that not fizzle out sufficiently for you?


AUSTIN: Oh my god. Let’s go at 10 seconds.


[long pause]


[several distinct claps, tightly grouped together]


ART: Nope.


AUSTIN: What? That was pretty good. 20, just in case.


ART: Okay.


DRE: That sounded alright.


ART: I heard, like, 5 claps.


[short pause]


[several claps tightly grouped, followed by one clap about half a second later]


ART: Now that's a clap.


KEITH: That sounded much better to me.


AUSTIN: That was way worse, okay.


ART: Wha-?


[DRE laughs, AUSTIN sighs]


SYLVIA: That’s the way. It’s different for everyone.


KEITH: Hey listen, umm… I found a low-latency uh, like VoIP thing called ‘Mumble.’


AUSTIN: We are not switching to Mumble.


DRE: No, god. Mumble sounds awful.


AUSTIN: It sounds so bad.


KEITH: Does it like, li- actually sound bad?


AUSTIN: Yeah, I think it sounds bad. 


DRE: Yeah, it does.


KEITH: Okay, I never used it. I never actually tried it out.


SYLVIA (overlapping): I fuckin’ hate Mumble.


ART: Oh, we’re not just talking about how like the name ‘Mumble’ sounds?


DRE: I mean, it’s also bad.


AUSTIN: Yeah, it's also bad.


KEITH (overlapping): Yeah, that's what I thought you meant at first.


AUSTIN: The name Mumble is also bad. Like, why would you actually name yourself that, you know?


DRE: Yeah.


KEITH (overlapping): Especially if it doesn’t sound very good. You know?


AUSTIN: Right.


[ART laughs]


AUSTIN: Alright, umm-


[SYLVIA sighs]


ART: Check out my new chat program: ‘Clear Voice.’


AUSTIN: That’s probably a chat program, Art.


ART: Ah well, fuck. I printed all these t-shirts…


[DRE and AUSTIN laugh]


[NEW CLIP]




AUSTIN (staticky): Well, I just tried to tinker, and now it’s all fucked again, so… Umm…


[ART laughs]


ALI: Oh, do not tinker. This is not the time for tinkering. Umm...


AUSTIN: Eh. You know. 


ALI (distrustfully): Mm.


AUSTIN: (introduction voice) Welcome to Friends at the Table, an actual-play podcast. Yeah, that's a little, that’s a little spiky.


ALI: Okay. Alright.


AUSTIN: I’ll bring it down. I’m just fucking with it, I’m just tryin’ to, you know.


ALI: Yeah, I was like, “wha- claps, what?” (laughs)


AUSTIN (overlapping): We’re here, we’re here now. Yeah.


ALI: Oh, are you hearing that like, electronica noise, am I good?


AUSTIN: Yeah, you’re good.


ALI: Okay.


ART (overlapping): Am I hearing a noise on your end? No.


ALI: Okay. Last time we recorded, there was like a weird buzz.


AUSTIN (overlapping): The other day- yeah. Yeah, I don’t hear it, we’re good.


ART: Well, it’s better if we have like, weird tech problems on this episode, cuz we can be like “oh, that was ghosts.”


AUSTIN: Right, good call.


ALI: That’s true.


AUSTIN: Or was it? 


AUSTIN, ART, ALI, and SYLVIA: (spookily, with varying levels of enthusiasm) ooooh.


AUSTIN: Okay, good.


ALI: This going to be a fun recording. Umm...


AUSTIN: Perfect. Right, I’m excited. This game is actually super good. From what I’ve read, anyway. I mean, we’ll see. We’ll see how it is in play.


ALI: Umm…


AUSTIN: The number one tip from me for y’all is: I don’t have an answer, I don’t know what the ghosts are. I don’t- and I’m not supposed to.


ALI (laughing): Okay.


SYLVIA: Don’t worry, I’ve got you.


AUSTIN: When you succeed, it means that you have to decide stuff. Like there aren’t- I don’t leave clues, is like the important thing.


ALI: Okay.


AUSTIN: Like that's the trick of this game, is you find your own clues and tell me what the clues are. Umm… And like, I do my best to tie shit together,  say like “oh yeah, that sounds like it was stressful, roll a stress die,” but like, we ain’t- you’re not solving, this is not the Sherlock Holmes style thing, you know?


ALI (jokingly): Then what are you even hear for? (laughs)


AUSTIN: Aaah, I mean, this book straight up says like “once everyone knows how to play this game, you don’t need a GM.” Like, once everyone’s comfortable saying what a failure looks like, like you really just- you can play yourself, really. You know?


ALI: Okay.


AUSTIN: Which is cool. So…


ART: Sure. But like fuckin’ “Friends at the Table: We Know What Failure Looks Like.” Right, that’s our motto?


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: Uh-huh. We do, we sure do. Thank Christ for that. Umm… Okay, alright. Do you wanna time.is? Are we all recording?


ALI: Yeah. Umm...


ART: Yeah.


SYLVIA: Uh… One sec. Oh yeah, I am recording, nevermind.


[ALI giggling]


AUSTIN: Ahh… Going to bring myself down in the OBS. Um, okay. Lets uh, time.is at… uh, 15 seconds if we’re all there.


ALI: Yeah.


ART: Okay.


SYLVIA: Mm-hm.


[a nice cluster of claps]


AUSTIN: Okay. Mine didn’t go all the way up, which is weird. Can we do another one just to be clear?


ALI (laughing): Okay.


[ART laughs]


AUSTIN: Like, I didn’t clap enough in front of the microphone.


ALI: Okay.


AUSTIN: So, lets do 35?


ALI: Um, if its an isolated line, it’ll…


AUSTIN: Lets just do a backup, just in case.


ALI: Yeah.


[A slightly less-good cluster of claps]


AUSTIN: Okay.


ART: That one was bad.


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: Lets just use the first one. It’ll be fine.


[ART laughs]


ALI: I’ll know where to- I’ll know where to-


AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah, now you’ll know where to look. Its before the one that looks like a clap on mine. 


ALI: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.


AUSTIN: Okay.


[ALI laughs]


ART: How- how bad does… eh, nevermind.


AUSTIN (overlapping): Don’t worry about it. Don’t worry about it!


[ALI and ART laugh]


[NEW CLIP]




ALI: Hey, hi, hello, hello.


AUSTIN: Hello! Hi. 


ALI: Hello, heya.


AUSTIN: Heya. 


[ALI giggling]


AUSTIN: Hey there pals, I’m gonna hit the button that let’s me do a thing.


ALI (overlapping): Hi.


[Long pause]


[claps]


AUSTIN: I heard that clap.


ALI (overlapping): That was… (laughs)


[JACK laughs]


AUSTIN: I heard it behind me-


ALI: Oh.


AUSTIN: Because Jack is in the- the building with me. Jack is here in New York.


JACK: Yeah.


AUSTIN: You need to know that based on the pizza story, that should have come together I guess. Umm...


[ALI laughs]


ALI: I wish I was there, this isn’t fair. Especially since we started late, I should have just…


AUSTIN (overlapping): We’re in different rooms. We’re not even, you know what I mean.


ALI: Yeah.


JACK (overlapping): Yeah, we’re not even in the same room.


AUSTIN: Yeah.


JACK: I can’t see Austin right now.


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN (quietly): I can very barely hear him, but I can hear him just a little bit.


JACK: My headphones are really good, so I can’t hear Austin- I can’t hear Austin at all, I’ve just been guessing what he’s been saying


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: Yeah. its- thats true.


JACK: Its going great.


AUSTIN: Ahhh- wait, you can hear me though, right, that was a bit?


JACK: Yeah no, that was a bit I can actually hear you.


AUSTIN: Okay.


JACK: I can’t actually hear you through the- through the wall though.


AUSTIN: Ahh, okay, I’m gonna just get my notes real quick, because I had like a good intro last time, and I- oh here, no wait that's not it. Where did I put that?


ALI: Mm-hm. You just wrote it. You just consulted us about it.


AUSTIN (surprised): What?


JACK: No, I think he means different notes-


ALI: Oh, okay.


JACK: I think the ones where he says the, the thing that we say at the beginning, but slightly differently.


AUSTIN: Yeah, thats it, thats the thing I’m talking about.


ALI: Yeah, you just-


AUSTIN: Where did I put that?


ALI (amused): In your brain.


AUSTIN: No, I didn’t.


[ALI laughs]


JACK: Did you write it on… oh, I think it was for the title of the stream, right? About planning, performing, and producing?


AUSTIN (overlapping): No, that's a different thing. 


JACK: Yeah, it's a different one. You have to say “Welcome to Friends at the Table…”


AUSTIN (overlapping): Thats “Hey, welcome to Friends at the Table, blah blah blah…”


JACK: “An actual-play podcast, a tips podcast, on...”


AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah, that's- remember, I did this.


[Typing, ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: You don’t remember this?


JACK: No, I remember it. I don’t remember what it is.


AUSTIN (overlapping): A Q&A podcast?


JACK: A Q&A podcast focused on…


ALI: Oh, you mean the thing that you said last month, not the like, remixed version of it.


AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah, yes.


JACK (overlapping): Someone in the chat says “you say: hopefully good advice, if that helps,” which I think


AUSTIN (overlapping): Oh, it does, I can search for that, I can search for “hopefully good advice.”


[ALI laughs]


AUSTIN: Well, I’ll just search for “good advice, because I may have ad-libbed… 


JACK (overlapping): You know, I’d love to search for hopefully good advice.


AUSTIN: Oh, I bet I know where it is, let's see if its there- lets see if its where I think it is. Spreadsheets...


ALI: Just search for “advice”


AUSTIN: No, I have to- I have a long- there’s a whole thing here.


ALI (laughing): Okay.


AUSTIN: I think, maybe, it's… not where I thought it would be. (very quietly) Fuck, I swear to Christ. I’m going to search for advice.


JACK: Do you want me to come into the room and help look for it?


[ALI and JACK laugh]


AUSTIN: yeah, can you just start looking just around generally, is it out there, Jack? It's not out there?
